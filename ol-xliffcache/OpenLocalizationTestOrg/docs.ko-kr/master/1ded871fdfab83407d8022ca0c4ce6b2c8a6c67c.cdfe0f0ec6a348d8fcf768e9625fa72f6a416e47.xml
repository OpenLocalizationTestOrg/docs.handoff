When the button is clicked, it looks as if it is being pushed in and released. Whenever the user clicks a button, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event handler is invoked. You place code in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event handler to perform any action you choose.  \n  \n The text displayed on the button is contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property. If your text exceeds the width of the button, it will wrap to the next line. However, it will be clipped if the control cannot accommodate its overall height. For more information, see [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md). The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property can contain an access key, which allows a user to \"click\" the control by pressing the ALT key with the access key. For details, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md). The appearance of the text is controlled by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.TextAlign%2A> property.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control can also display images using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.Image%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ButtonBase.ImageList%2A> properties. For more information, see [How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](how-to-set-the-image-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
