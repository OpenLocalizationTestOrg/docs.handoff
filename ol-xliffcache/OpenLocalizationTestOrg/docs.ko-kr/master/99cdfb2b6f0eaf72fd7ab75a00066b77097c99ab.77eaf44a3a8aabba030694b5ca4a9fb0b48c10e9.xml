The examples in this topic show how you can use generated method wrappers for stored procedures, and how you can call stored procedures directly.  \n  \n If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to assign stored procedures to perform inserts, updates, and deletes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To read back database-generated values, use output parameters in your stored procedures. If you cannot use output parameters, write a partial method implementation instead of relying on overrides generated by the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)]. Members mapped to database-generated values must be set to appropriate values after `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations have successfully completed.
