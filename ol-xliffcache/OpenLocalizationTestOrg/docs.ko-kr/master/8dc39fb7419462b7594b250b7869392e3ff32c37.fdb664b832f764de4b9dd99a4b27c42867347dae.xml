The **Runnable Instances Detection Period** property of the SQL Workflow Instance Store specifies the time period after which the SQL Workflow Instance Store runs a detection task to detect any runnable or activatable workflow instances in the persistence database after the previous detection cycle.  \n  \n Setting a shorter interval for this property reduces the time between the expiration of a timer associated with a workflow instance and the signaling of the event and subsequent loading of the instance. However, it also increases the processing load on a host and may not be desirable in scenarios where durable timers and/or host failures are rare. The type of the property is TimeSpan and the value of the property follows the format: hh:mm:ss. The minimum value for this property is 00:00:01. The default value for the property is 00:00:05.  \n  \n For more information detecting and activating runnable and activatable workflow instances, see [Instance Activation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/instance-activation.md).","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"Runnable Instances Detection Period | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Runnable Instances Detection Period | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[329,364],"content":"Runnable Instances Detection Period","linkify":"Runnable Instances Detection Period","nodes":[{"content":"Runnable Instances Detection Period","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"The SQL Workflow Instance Store runs an internal task that periodically wakes up and detects runnable or activatable instances in the persistence database.","pos":[365,520]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Runnable Instances Detection Period<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property of the SQL Workflow Instance Store specifies the time period after which the SQL Workflow Instance Store runs a detection task to detect any runnable or activatable workflow instances in the persistence database after the previous detection cycle.","pos":[521,821],"source":" The **Runnable Instances Detection Period** property of the SQL Workflow Instance Store specifies the time period after which the SQL Workflow Instance Store runs a detection task to detect any runnable or activatable workflow instances in the persistence database after the previous detection cycle."},{"content":"Setting a shorter interval for this property reduces the time between the expiration of a timer associated with a workflow instance and the signaling of the event and subsequent loading of the instance.","pos":[828,1030]},{"content":"However, it also increases the processing load on a host and may not be desirable in scenarios where durable timers and/or host failures are rare.","pos":[1031,1177]},{"content":"The type of the property is TimeSpan and the value of the property follows the format: hh:mm:ss.","pos":[1178,1274]},{"content":"The minimum value for this property is 00:00:01.","pos":[1275,1323]},{"content":"The default value for the property is 00:00:05.","pos":[1324,1371]},{"pos":[1378,1571],"content":"For more information detecting and activating runnable and activatable workflow instances, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Instance Activation<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/instance-activation.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information detecting and activating runnable and activatable workflow instances, see [Instance Activation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/instance-activation.md)."}]}
