The sample service is a simple expense approval service and exposes three operations.  \n  \n [Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/durable-duplex.md)  \n Demonstrates how to set up and configure durable duplex message exchange using the messaging activities in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n [Content-Based Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/content-based-correlation.md)  \n Demonstrates how the messaging activities (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply>) can be used with multiple content-based correlations and content-based correlation.  \n  \n [Channel Caching with Send](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/channel-caching-with-send.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendMessageChannelCache>.  \n  \n [Durable Delay in XAMLX](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/durable-delay-in-xamlx.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use a durable delay, which is a delay that persists the workflow to a durable device during the delay.  \n  \n [Buffered Receive](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/buffered-receive.md)  \n Demonstrates how to set up and configure the buffered receive feature in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n [XAML Activation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/xaml-activation.md)  \n Demonstrates how to host a declarative workflow in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Workflow
