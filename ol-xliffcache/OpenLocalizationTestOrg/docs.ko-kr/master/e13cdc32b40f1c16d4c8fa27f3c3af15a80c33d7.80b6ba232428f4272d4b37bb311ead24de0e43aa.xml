The field may be dynamically specified at runtime. Assume that the fields in scores.csv represent a student's ID number, followed by a series of four test scores.  \n  \n### To create a file that contains data  \n  \n1.  Copy the scores.csv data from the topic [How to: Join Content from Dissimilar Files (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-join-content-from-dissimilar-files-linq.md) and save it to your solution folder.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \nClass SortLines  \n  \n    Shared Sub Main()  \n        Dim scores As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(\"../../../scores.csv\")  \n  \n        ' Change this to any value from 0 to 4  \n        Dim sortField As Integer = 1  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Sorted highest to lowest by field \" & sortField)  \n  \n        ' Demonstrates how to return query from a method.  \n        ' The query is executed here.  \n        For Each str As String In SortQuery(scores, sortField)  \n            Console.WriteLine(str)  \n        Next  \n  \n        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\")  \n        Console.ReadKey()  \n  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Shared Function SortQuery(  \n        ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of String),   \n        ByVal num As Integer) As IEnumerable(Of String)  \n  \n        Dim scoreQuery = From line In source   \n                         Let fields = line.Split(New Char() {\",\"})   \n                         Order By fields(num) Descending   \n                         Select line  \n  \n        Return scoreQuery  \n    End Function  \nEnd Class  \n' Output:  \n' Sorted highest to lowest by field 1  \n' 116, 99, 86, 90, 94  \n' 120, 99, 82, 81, 79  \n' 111, 97, 92, 81, 60  \n' 114, 97, 89, 85, 82  \n' 121, 96, 85, 91, 60  \n' 122, 94, 92, 91, 91  \n' 117, 93, 92, 80, 87  \n' 118, 92, 90, 83, 78  \n' 113, 88, 94, 65, 91  \n' 112, 75, 84, 91, 39  \n' 119, 68, 79, 88, 92  \n' 115, 35, 72, 91, 70  \n```  \n  \n This example also demonstrates how to return a query variable from a Function.  \n  \n##
