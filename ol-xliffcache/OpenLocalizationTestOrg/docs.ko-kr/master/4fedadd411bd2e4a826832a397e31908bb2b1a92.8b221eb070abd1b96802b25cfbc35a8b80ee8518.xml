The compiler imposes this limit to reduce the size of error and warning reports.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42206  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Review the other warnings generated by this compilation and resolve as many as possible. If the source code contains more than 100 warnings, you might see more warnings in the next compilation.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,205],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc42206\"\n  - \"vbc42206\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC42206\"\nms.assetid: 4e55fa8a-2927-43a4-b6b1-5ed8e8bd877f","nodes":[{"content":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","nodes":[{"content":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[212,256],"content":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","linkify":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","nodes":[{"content":"Maximum number of warnings has been exceeded","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"The maximum number of compilation warnings is 100.","pos":[257,307]},{"content":"The compiler imposes this limit to reduce the size of error and warning reports.","pos":[308,388]},{"content":"By default, this message is a warning.","pos":[395,433]},{"content":"For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)</ept>.","pos":[434,605],"source":" For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)."},{"pos":[612,633],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC42206","source":"**Error ID:** BC42206"},{"pos":[642,663],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Review the other warnings generated by this compilation and resolve as many as possible.","pos":[673,761]},{"content":"If the source code contains more than 100 warnings, you might see more warnings in the next compilation.","pos":[762,866]},{"pos":[875,883],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[887,984],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)"},{"pos":[987,1081],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)</ept>","source":"[Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)"}]}
