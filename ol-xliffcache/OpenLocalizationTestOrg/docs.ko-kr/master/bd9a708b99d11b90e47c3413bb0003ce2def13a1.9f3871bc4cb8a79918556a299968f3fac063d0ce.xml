It creates the manifest in the same folder in which the executable file is built, typically the bin\\Debug or bin\\Release folder when you use Visual Studio. If you want to supply a custom manifest, for example to specify a requested execution level of highestAvailable or requireAdministrator, use this option to specify the name of the file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This option and the [-win32resource](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/win32resource.md) option are mutually exclusive. If you try to use both options in the same command line, you will get a build error.  \n  \n An application that has no application manifest that specifies a requested execution level will be subject to file/registry virtualization under the User Account Control feature in Windows Vista. For more information about virtualization, see [ClickOnce Deployment on Windows Vista](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-deployment-on-windows-vista).  \n  \n Your application will be subject to virtualization if either of the following conditions is true:  \n  \n1.  You use the `-nowin32manifest` option and you do not provide a manifest in a later build step or as part of a Windows Resource (.res) file by using the `-win32resource` option.  \n  \n2.  You provide a custom manifest that does not specify a requested execution level.  \n  \n Visual Studio creates a default .manifest file and stores it in the debug and release directories alongside the executable file. You can view or edit the default app.manifest file by clicking **View UAC Settings** on the **Application** tab in the Project Designer. For more information, see [Application Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](/visualstudio/ide/reference/application-page-project-designer-visual-basic).  \n  \n You can provide the application manifest as a custom post-build step or as part of a Win32 resource file by using the `-nowin32manifest` option. Use that same option if you want your application to be subject to file or registry virtualization on Windows Vista. This will prevent the compiler from creating and embedding a default manifest in the PE file.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows the default manifest that the Visual Basic compiler inserts into a PE.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The compiler inserts a standard application name MyApplication.app into the manifest XML.
