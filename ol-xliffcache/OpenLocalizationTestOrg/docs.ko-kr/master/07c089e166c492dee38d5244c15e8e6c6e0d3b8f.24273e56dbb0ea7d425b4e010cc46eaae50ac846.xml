Auto-implemented properties should be avoided in structs because they have no backing field and therefore cannot be initialized in any way from the constructor.  \n  \n For more information, see [Using Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md).  \n  \n## Example\n\n The following sample generates CS0188:  \n\n```csharp\n// CS0188.cs  \n// compile with: /t:library  \nnamespace MyNamespace  \n{  \n    class MyClass  \n    {  \n        struct S  \n        {  \n            public int a;  \n  \n            void MyMethod()  \n            {  \n            }  \n  \n            S(int i)  \n            {  \n                // a = i;  \n                MyMethod();  // CS0188  \n            }  \n        }  \n        public static void Main()  \n        { }  \n  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/structs.md)\n- [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0188\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0188\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0188\"\nms.assetid: 4e693c18-584d-4c94-9863-283c69b97b0b","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0188","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0188","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0188","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0188","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0188","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0188","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"The 'this' object cannot be used before all of its fields are assigned to","pos":[195,268]},{"pos":[275,394],"content":"All fields in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph> have to be assigned by a constructor before the constructor can call a method in the <ph id=\"ph2\">`struct`</ph>.","source":"All fields in a `struct` have to be assigned by a constructor before the constructor can call a method in the `struct`."},{"content":"If you see this error when trying to initialize a property in a struct constructor, the solution is to change the constructor parameter to specify the backing field instead of the property itself.","pos":[401,597]},{"content":"Auto-implemented properties should be avoided in structs because they have no backing field and therefore cannot be initialized in any way from the constructor.","pos":[598,758]},{"pos":[765,879],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [Using Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-structs.md)."},{"pos":[888,895],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0188:","pos":[898,936]},{"pos":[1387,1395],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1399,1474],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/structs.md)</ept>","source":"[Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/structs.md)"},{"pos":[1477,1592],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Auto-Implemented Properties<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md)</ept>","source":"[Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md)"}]}
