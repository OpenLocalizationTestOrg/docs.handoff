The `Bitmap` class and the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> class both inherit from the `Image` class. The `Bitmap` class expands on the capabilities of the `Image` class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> class expands on the capabilities of the `Image` class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Types of Bitmaps](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/types-of-bitmaps.md)  \n Discusses the various image formats.  \n  \n [Metafiles in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/metafiles-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] support for metafiles.  \n  \n [Drawing, Positioning, and Cloning Images in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/drawing-positioning-and-cloning-images-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses methods for drawing vector and raster images with
