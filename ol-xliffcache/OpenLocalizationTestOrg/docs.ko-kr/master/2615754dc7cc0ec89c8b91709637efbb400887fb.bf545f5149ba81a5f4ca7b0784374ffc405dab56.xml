The `Prompt` activity uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activities that ship as part of the .NET Framework, and also incorporates the custom `ReadLine` activity for getting user input. The last custom activity is the `Survey` activity. It is an <xref:System.Activities.Activity><ICollection\\<string>>.  This activity takes an <xref:System.Activities.InArgument%601><IEnumerable<string\\>> named `Questions` and populates the `Result` out argument with the responses. The `Survey` activity uses <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601> from the .NET Framework and employs the `Prompt` activity for asking the survey questions and getting responses.  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open the **BasicActivityComposition.sln** sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Build and run the solution.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
