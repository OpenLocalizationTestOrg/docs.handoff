The sample is a basic workflow called `EchoService` that has one operation.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to (download page) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WF\\Basic\\Services\\XAMLActivation`  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open the XAMLActivation.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Build the solution by pressing **F5**.  \n  \n3.  Run WcfTestClient.exe. From a command prompt, type in the following:  \n  \n    1.  cd %SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\Common7\\IDE  \n  \n    2.  Run WcfTestClient.exe.  \n  \n4.  Set the address of the service on WcfTestClient.exe by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+A and setting the service address to http://localhost:56133/Service.xamlx.  \n  \n5.  Perform the echo operation to test the service.  \n  \n6.  Deploy the Service in IIS using DeployToIIS.Bat in a command prompt with administrator privileges.  \n  \n7.  Update the service address in the client to http://localhost/XAMLActivation/Service.xamlx and test the service again using WcfTestClient.exe.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,44],"content":"XAML Activation | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"XAML Activation | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,32]}]},{"pos":[310,325],"content":"XAML Activation","linkify":"XAML Activation","nodes":[{"content":"XAML Activation","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates how to host a declarative workflow in IIS.","pos":[326,393]},{"content":"The sample is a basic workflow called <ph id=\"ph1\">`EchoService`</ph> that has one operation.","pos":[394,469],"source":" The sample is a basic workflow called `EchoService` that has one operation."},{"pos":[477,609],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your machine.
