At the beginning of a `For` loop, the start point, the end point, and the step value are evaluated in textual order. All three expressions must be implicitly convertible to the type of the variable. If the `For` loop variable is of type `Object`, then at least one of the expressions at run time must be of a numeric type, and all three expressions must be coercible to the widest numeric type among them.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30337  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Check the type of the loop control variable and change it to a valid one.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [For...Next Statement (Visual Basic)](../language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)\n- [Do...Loop Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/do-loop-statement.md)\n- [For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,215],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '<type>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30337\"\n  - \"bc30337\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30337\"\nms.assetid: 988bba15-e9a2-4045-98a0-7f53c8b2c3e3","nodes":[{"content":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '<type>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;type&gt;</ph>'","source":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '<type>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[222,277],"content":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '\\<type>'","linkify":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '\\<type>'","nodes":[{"content":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>type&gt;'","pos":[0,55],"source":"'For' loop control variable cannot be of type '\\<type>'"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to use a loop control variable that is not a valid type.","pos":[278,353]},{"content":"At the beginning of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`For`</ph> loop, the start point, the end point, and the step value are evaluated in textual order.","pos":[354,470],"source":" At the beginning of a `For` loop, the start point, the end point, and the step value are evaluated in textual order."},{"content":"All three expressions must be implicitly convertible to the type of the variable.","pos":[471,552]},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">`For`</ph> loop variable is of type <ph id=\"ph2\">`Object`</ph>, then at least one of the expressions at run time must be of a numeric type, and all three expressions must be coercible to the widest numeric type among them.","pos":[553,759],"source":" If the `For` loop variable is of type `Object`, then at least one of the expressions at run time must be of a numeric type, and all three expressions must be coercible to the widest numeric type among them."},{"pos":[766,787],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30337","source":"**Error ID:** BC30337"},{"pos":[796,817],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check the type of the loop control variable and change it to a valid one.","pos":[827,900]},{"pos":[909,917],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[921,1014],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>For...Next Statement (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[For...Next Statement (Visual Basic)](../language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1017,1109],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Do...Loop Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/do-loop-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Do...Loop Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/do-loop-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1112,1206],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>For...Next Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)"}]}
