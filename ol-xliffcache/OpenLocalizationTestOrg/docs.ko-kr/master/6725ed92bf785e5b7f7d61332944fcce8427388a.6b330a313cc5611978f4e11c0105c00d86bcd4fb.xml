If you want to write a fully-declarative workflow, then you need an activity that can return the workflow instance ID so that the activity can be referenced in the workflow to provide a fully-declarative workflow authoring experience. Many scenarios require access to the instance ID: a few examples are for logging or auditing purposes or for doing application-level correlation by providing the instance ID back to a client for future association (for example, by using this activity inside a SendReply activity).  \n  \n `GetWorkflowInstanceId` is implemented as a <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601> because it must return a value of type <xref:System.Guid>, and it must have access to the <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivityContext> for getting the workflow’s instance ID. Its implementation is fairly basic.  \n  \n```  \npublic sealed class GetWorkflowInstanceId : CodeActivity<Guid>  \n{  \nprotected override Guid Execute(CodeActivityContext context)  \n        {  \n            return context.WorkflowInstanceId;  \n        }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
