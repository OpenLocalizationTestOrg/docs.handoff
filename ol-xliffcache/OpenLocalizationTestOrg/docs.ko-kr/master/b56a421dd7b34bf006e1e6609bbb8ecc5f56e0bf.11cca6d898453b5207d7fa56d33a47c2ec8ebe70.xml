Although originally designed for use with Visual Basic, the `MyServices` namespace can be used in C# applications.  \n  \n For more information about using the `MyServices` namespace from Visual Basic, see [Development with My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/index.md).  \n  \n## Adding a Reference  \n Before you can use the `MyServices` classes in your solution, you must add a reference to the Visual Basic library.  \n  \n#### To add a reference to the Visual Basic library  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **References** node, and select **Add Reference**.  \n  \n2.  When the **References** dialog box appears, scroll down the list, and select Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.  \n  \n     You might also want to include the following line in the `using` section at the start of your program.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[csProgGuideNamespaces#18](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideNamespaces/CS/Namespaces3.cs#18)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example calls various static methods contained in the `MyServices` namespace. For this code to compile, a reference to Microsoft.VisualBasic.DLL must be added to the project.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csProgGuideNamespaces#19](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideNamespaces/CS/Namespaces3.cs#19)]  \n  \n Not all the classes in the `MyServices` namespace can be called from a C# application: for example, the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.FileSystemProxy> class is not compatible. In this particular case, the static methods that are part of <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>, which are also contained in VisualBasic.dll, can be used instead. For example, here is how to use one such method to duplicate a directory:  \n  \n
