In the first phase, the synchronization object, a `Latch`, spins for a few cycles while it checks whether the lock has become available. In the second phase, if the lock becomes available, then the `Wait` method returns without using the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType> to perform its wait; otherwise, `Wait` performs the wait.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example shows a very basic implementation of a Latch synchronization primitive. You can use this data structure when wait times are expected to be very short. This example is for demonstration purposes only. If you require latch-type functionality in your program, consider using <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEventSlim?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CDS_SpinWait#03](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_spinwait/cs/spinwait03.cs#03)]\n [!code-vb[CDS_SpinWait#03](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_spinwait/vb/spinwait2.vb#03)]  \n  \n The latch uses the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait> object to spin in place only until the next call to `SpinOnce` causes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait> to yield the time slice of the thread. At that point, the latch causes its own context switch by calling <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> on the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent> and passing in the remainder of the time-out value.  \n  \n The logging output shows how often the Latch was able to increase performance by acquiring the lock without using the <xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [SpinWait](../../../docs/standard/threading/spinwait.md)\n- [Threading Objects and Features](../../../docs/standard/threading/threading-objects-and-features.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,321],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"SpinWait, how to synchronize two-phase wait\"\nms.assetid: b2ac4e4a-051a-4f65-b4b9-f8e103aff195\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","pos":[0,60]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[328,388],"content":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","linkify":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use SpinWait to Implement a Two-Phase Wait Operation","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.SpinWait?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> object to implement a two-phase wait operation.","pos":[389,539],"source":"The following example shows how to use a <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait?displayProperty=nameWithType> object to implement a two-phase wait operation."},{"content":"In the first phase, the synchronization object, a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Latch`</ph>, spins for a few cycles while it checks whether the lock has become available.","pos":[540,676],"source":" In the first phase, the synchronization object, a `Latch`, spins for a few cycles while it checks whether the lock has become available."},{"content":"In the second phase, if the lock becomes available, then the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Wait`</ph> method returns without using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.ManualResetEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> to perform its wait;
