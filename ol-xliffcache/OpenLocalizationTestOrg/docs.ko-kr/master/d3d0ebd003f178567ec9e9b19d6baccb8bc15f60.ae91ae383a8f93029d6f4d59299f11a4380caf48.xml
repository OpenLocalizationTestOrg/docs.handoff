Possible causes include:  \n  \n-   A `FilePutObject` or `FileGetObject` statement specifies a sequential file.  \n  \n-   A `Print` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Output` or `Append`.  \n  \n-   An `Input` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Input`  \n  \n-   An attempt to write to a read-only file.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure `FilePutObject` and `FileGetObject` are only referring to files open for `Random` or `Binary` access.  \n  \n-   Make sure `Print` specifies a file opened for either `Output` or `Append` access mode. If not, use a different statement to place data in the file, or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.  \n  \n-   Make sure `Input` specifies a file opened for `Input`. If not, use a different statement to place data in the file or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.  \n  \n-   If you are writing to a read-only file, change the read/write status of the file or do not try to write to it.  \n  \n-   Use the functionality available in the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem>\n- [Troubleshooting: Reading from and Writing to Text Files](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/troubleshooting-reading-from-and-writing-to-text-files.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,123],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Bad file mode\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID54\"\nms.assetid: 74891e96-884b-4c8d-872d-cd11ae272372","nodes":[{"content":"Bad file mode","nodes":[{"pos":[0,13],"content":"Bad file mode","nodes":[{"content":"Bad file mode","pos":[0,13]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[130,143],"content":"Bad file mode","linkify":"Bad file mode","nodes":[{"content":"Bad file mode","pos":[0,13]}]},{"content":"Statements used in manipulating file contents must be appropriate to the mode in which the file was opened.","pos":[144,251]},{"content":"Possible causes include:","pos":[252,276]},{"pos":[286,361],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePutObject`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FileGetObject`</ph> statement specifies a sequential file.","source":"A `FilePutObject` or `FileGetObject` statement specifies a sequential file."},{"pos":[371,466],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`Print`</ph> statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than <ph id=\"ph2\">`Output`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`Append`</ph>.","source":"A `Print` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Output` or `Append`."},{"pos":[476,558],"content":"An <ph id=\"ph1\">`Input`</ph> statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than <ph id=\"ph2\">`Input`</ph>","source":"An `Input` statement specifies a file opened for an access mode other than `Input`"},{"content":"An attempt to write to a read-only file.","pos":[568,608]},{"pos":[617,638],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[648,759],"content":"Make sure <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePutObject`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`FileGetObject`</ph> are only referring to files open for <ph id=\"ph3\">`Random`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">`Binary`</ph> access.","source":"Make sure `FilePutObject` and `FileGetObject` are only referring to files open for `Random` or `Binary` access."},{"content":"Make sure <ph id=\"ph1\">`Print`</ph> specifies a file opened for either <ph id=\"ph2\">`Output`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`Append`</ph> access mode.","pos":[769,855],"source":"Make sure `Print` specifies a file opened for either `Output` or `Append` access mode."},{"content":"If not, use a different statement to place data in the file, or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.","pos":[856,959]},{"content":"Make sure <ph id=\"ph1\">`Input`</ph> specifies a file opened for <ph id=\"ph2\">`Input`</ph>.","pos":[969,1023],"source":"Make sure `Input` specifies a file opened for `Input`."},{"content":"If not, use a different statement to place data in the file or reopen the file in an appropriate mode.","pos":[1024,1126]},{"content":"If you are writing to a read-only file, change the read/write status of the file or do not try to write to it.","pos":[1136,1246]},{"pos":[1256,1327],"content":"Use the functionality available in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.Computer.FileSystem`</ph> object.","source":"Use the functionality available in the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object."},{"pos":[1336,1344],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1390,1581],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Troubleshooting: Reading from and Writing to Text Files<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/troubleshooting-reading-from-and-writing-to-text-files.md)</ept>","source":"[Troubleshooting: Reading from and Writing to Text Files](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/troubleshooting-reading-from-and-writing-to-text-files.md)"}]}
