This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Binding\\Basic\\Http`  \n  \n## Sample Details  \n This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.  \n  \n To use the basic binding with default behavior, only the binding section name is required. If you want to configure the basic binding and change some of its settings, it is necessary to define a binding configuration. The endpoint must reference the binding configuration by name by using the `bindingConfiguration` attribute of the <`endpoint`> element, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```xml  \n<services>  \n    <service   \n        type=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\"  \n        behaviorConfiguration=\"CalculatorServiceBehavior\">  \n       <endpoint address=\"\"  \n             binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"  \n             bindingConfiguration=\"Binding1\"   \n             contract=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator\" />  \n    </service>  \n</services>  \n```  \n  \n In this sample, the binding configuration is named `\"Binding1\"` and is defined as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n```xml  \n<bindings>  \n   <basicHttpBinding>  \n      <binding name=\"Binding1\"   \n               hostNameComparisonMode=\"StrongWildcard\"   \n               receiveTimeout=\"00:10:00\"  \n               sendTimeout=\"00:10:00\"  \n               openTimeout=\"00:10:00\"  \n               closeTimeout=\"00:10:00\"  \n               maxMessageSize=\"65536\"   \n               maxBufferSize=\"65536\"   \n               maxBufferPoolSize=\"524288\"   \n               transferMode=\"Buffered\"   \n               messageEncoding=\"Text\"   \n               textEncoding=\"utf-8\"  \n               bypassProxyOnLocal=\"false\"  \n               useDefaultWebProxy=\"true\" >  \n         <security mode=\"None\" />  \n      </binding>  \n   </basicHttpBinding>  \n</bindings>  \n```  \n  \n The binding element provides attributes for setting the host name comparison mode, maximum message size, proxy options, timeouts, message encoding, and other options.  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.XXXXX\\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,96],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"BasicBinding\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 86fbeb87-4d89-4b61-9577-867e0ac12945","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding","nodes":[{"pos":[0,12],"content":"BasicBinding","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding","pos":[0,12]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[103,115],"content":"BasicBinding","linkify":"BasicBinding","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[116,280],"content":"This sample demonstrates the use of <ph id=\"ph1\">`basicHttpBinding`</ph> that provides HTTP communication and maximum interoperability with first- and second-generation Web services.","source":"This sample demonstrates the use of `basicHttpBinding` that provides HTTP communication and maximum interoperability with first- and second-generation Web services."},{"pos":[288,396],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","pos":[9,106]}]},{"pos":[404,536],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your machine.
