All drawing done by a given <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object is restricted to the clip region of that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. You can set the clip region by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs a path that consists of a single polygon. Then the code constructs a region, based on that path. The region is passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, and then two strings are drawn.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the clipped strings.  \n  \n ![Clip](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/clip1.png \"clip1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#41](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#41](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Regions in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/regions-in-gdi.md)   \n [Using Regions](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-regions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,483],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Clipping with a Region | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
