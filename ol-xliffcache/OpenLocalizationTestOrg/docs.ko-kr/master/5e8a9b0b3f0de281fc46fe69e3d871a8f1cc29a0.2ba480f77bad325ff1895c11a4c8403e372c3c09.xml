Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a selected page range, or print a selection. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class.  \n  \n## Working with the Component  \n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box at run time. This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class). Either of these, in turn, may be shared by multiple printers.  \n  \n When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>   \n [PrintDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,75],"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,63]}]},{"pos":[575,621],"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintDialog<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept> component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications.","pos":[622,906],"source":"The Windows Forms [PrintDialog](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications."},{"content":"Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[907,1027]},{"content":"You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a selected page range, or print a selection.","pos":[1028,1150]},{"content":"By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.","pos":[1151,1279]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog&gt;</ph> component inherits from the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[1280,1399],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class."},{"pos":[1408,1434],"content":"Working with the Component","linkify":"Working with the Component","nodes":[{"content":"Working with the Component","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A&gt;</ph> method to display the dialog box at run time.","pos":[1438,1546],"source":"Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box at run time."},{"content":"This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings&gt;</ph> class).","pos":[1547,1767],"source":" This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class)."},{"content":"Either of these, in turn, may be shared by multiple printers.","pos":[1768,1829]},{"content":"When it is added to a form, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog&gt;</ph> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.","pos":[1836,1982],"source":"When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer."},{"pos":[1991,1999],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog&gt;</ph>","pos":[2003,2042],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>PrintDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[2046,2155],"source":" [PrintDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)"}]}
