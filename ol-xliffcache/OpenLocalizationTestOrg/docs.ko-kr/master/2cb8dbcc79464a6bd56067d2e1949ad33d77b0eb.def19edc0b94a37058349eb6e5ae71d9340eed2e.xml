As a result, the compiler cannot determine which version to implement.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30937  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the type argument or arguments you supply to the base class so that it does not result in one or more identical signatures of member procedures or properties.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Do not implement this base class. You cannot implement it with the set of type arguments you are using, because you must implement every one of its members.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Implements](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-clause.md)\n- [Implements Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,368],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Member '<interfacename>.<procedurename>' that matches this signature cannot be implemented because the interface '<interfacename>' contains multiple members with this same name and signature: <signaturelist>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
