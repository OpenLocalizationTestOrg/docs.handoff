The shape can be made up of lines, polygons, and curves.  \n  \n Two common uses for regions are hit testing and clipping. Hit testing is determining whether the mouse was clicked in a certain region of the screen. Clipping is restricting drawing to a certain region.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-hit-testing-with-a-region.md)  \n Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Region> to perform a hit test.  \n  \n [How to: Use Clipping with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)  \n Explains how to set the clipping region for a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Region>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,42],"content":"Using Regions | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Using Regions | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,30]}]},{"pos":[463,476],"content":"Using Regions","linkify":"Using Regions","nodes":[{"content":"Using Regions","pos":[0,13]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Region&gt;</ph> class allows you to define a custom shape.","pos":[477,620],"source":"The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] <xref:System.Drawing.Region> class allows you to define a custom shape."},{"content":"The shape can be made up of lines, polygons, and curves.","pos":[621,677]},{"content":"Two common uses for regions are hit testing and clipping.","pos":[684,741]},{"content":"Hit testing is determining whether the mouse was clicked in a certain region of the screen.","pos":[742,833]},{"content":"Clipping is restricting drawing to a certain region.","pos":[834,886]},{"pos":[895,910],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-hit-testing-with-a-region.md)</ept>","pos":[914,1039],"source":"[How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-hit-testing-with-a-region.md)"},{"content":"Shows how to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Region&gt;</ph> to perform a hit test.","pos":[1043,1113],"source":" Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Region> to perform a hit test."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Use Clipping with a Region<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)</ept>","pos":[1120,1239],"source":"[How to: Use Clipping with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to set the clipping region for a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[1243,1327],"source":" Explains how to set the clipping region for a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object."},{"pos":[1336,1345],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","pos":[1381,1443]},{"content":"Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","pos":[1484,1546]}]}
