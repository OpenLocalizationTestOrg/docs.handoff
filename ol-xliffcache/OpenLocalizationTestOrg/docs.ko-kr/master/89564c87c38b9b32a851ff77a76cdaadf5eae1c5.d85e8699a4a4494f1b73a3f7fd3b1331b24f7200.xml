This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service. In this sample, the service is self-hosted. Both the client and service are console applications.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Binding\\Net\\TCP\\Default`  \n  \n The binding is specified in the configuration files for the client and service. The binding type is specified in the `binding` attribute of the [\\<endpoint>](../../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element as shown in the following sample configuration.  \n  \n```xml  \n<endpoint address=\"\"  \n          binding=\"netTcpBinding\"  \n          contract=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator\" />  \n```  \n  \n The previous sample shows how to configure an endpoint to use the `netTcpBinding` binding with the default settings. If you want to configure the `netTcpBinding` binding and change some of its settings, it is necessary to define a binding configuration. The endpoint must reference the binding configuration by name with a `bindingConfiguration` attribute. In this sample, the binding configuration is named `Binding1` and is defined as shown in the following sample configuration.  \n  \n```xml  \n<services>  \n  <service name=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\"  \n           behaviorConfiguration=\"CalculatorServiceBehavior\">  \n    ...  \n    <endpoint address=\"\"  \n              binding=\"netTcpBinding\"  \n              bindingConfiguration=\"Binding1\"   \n              contract=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator\" />  \n    ...  \n  </service>  \n</services>  \n  \n<bindings>  \n  <netTcpBinding>  \n    <binding name=\"Binding1\"   \n             closeTimeout=\"00:01:00\"  \n             openTimeout=\"00:01:00\"   \n             receiveTimeout=\"00:10:00\"   \n             sendTimeout=\"00:01:00\"  \n             transactionFlow=\"false\"   \n             transferMode=\"Buffered\"   \n             transactionProtocol=\"OleTransactions\"  \n             hostNameComparisonMode=\"StrongWildcard\"   \n             listenBacklog=\"10\"  \n             maxBufferPoolSize=\"524288\"   \n             maxBufferSize=\"65536\"   \n             maxConnections=\"10\"  \n             maxReceivedMessageSize=\"65536\">  \n      <readerQuotas maxDepth=\"32\"   \n                    maxStringContentLength=\"8192\"   \n                    maxArrayLength=\"16384\"  \n                    maxBytesPerRead=\"4096\"   \n                    maxNameTableCharCount=\"16384\" />  \n      <reliableSession ordered=\"true\"   \n                       inactivityTimeout=\"00:10:00\"  \n                       enabled=\"false\" />  \n      <security mode=\"Transport\">  \n        <transport clientCredentialType=\"Windows\" protectionLevel=\"EncryptAndSign\" />  \n      </security>  \n    </binding>  \n  </netTcpBinding>  \n</bindings>  \n```  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nPress ENTER to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.XXXXX\\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  \n    ```  \n  \n2.
