It also demonstrates how to use this activity by providing an implementation of the <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction>.  \n  \n An <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction> allows an activity author to expose \"holes\" with specific signatures where the activity user can plug in a custom behavior. For example, the <!--zz <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach>--> `System.Activities.Statements.ForEach` activity, (which operates over a collection of items), has an <xref:System.Activities.ActivityAction> that allows the activity user to plug in behavior that operates on the current iteration item.  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open the **ActivityAction.sln** sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Build and run the solution.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
