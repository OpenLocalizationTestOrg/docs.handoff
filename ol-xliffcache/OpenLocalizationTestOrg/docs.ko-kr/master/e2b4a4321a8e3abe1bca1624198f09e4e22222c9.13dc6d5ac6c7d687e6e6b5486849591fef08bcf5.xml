This section describes the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] version 1.0 details (implemented in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>) for the following Web services security protocols.  \n  \n|Specification/Document|Link|  \n|-|-|  \n|WSS: SOAP Message Security 1.0|http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf|  \n|WSS: Username Token Profile 1.0|http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0.pdf|  \n|WSS: X509 Token Profile 1.0|http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-x509-token-profile-1.0.pdf|  \n|WSS: SAML 1.1 Token Profile 1.0|http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/oasis-wss-saml-token-profile-1.0.pdf|  \n|WSS: SOAP Message Security 1.1|http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16790/wss-v1.1-spec-os-SOAPMessageSecurity.pdf|  \n|WSS Username Token Profile 1.1|http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0.pdf|  \n|WSS: X.509 Token Profile 1.1|http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16785/wss-v1.1-spec-os-x509TokenProfile.pdf|  \n|WSS: Kerberos Token Profile 1.1|http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16788/wss-v1.1-spec-os-KerberosTokenProfile.pdf|  \n|WSS: SAML 1.1 Token Profile 1.1|http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16768/wss-v1.1-spec-os-SAMLTokenProfile.pdf|  \n|WS-Secure Conversation|http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2005/02/ws-secure-conversation/|  \n|WS-Trust|http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2005/02/ws-trust/|  \n|Application Note:<br /><br /> Using WS-Trust for TLS Handshake|To be published|  \n|Application Note:<br /><br /> Using WS-Trust for SPNEGO|To be published|  \n|Application Note:<br /><br /> Web Services Addressing Endpoint References And Identity|To be published|  \n|WS-SecurityPolicy 1.1<br /><br /> (2005/07)|http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2005/07/ws-security-policy/<br /><br /> as amended by errata submitted to OASIS WS-SX Technical Committee http://www.oasis-open.org/archives/ws-sx/200512/msg00017.html|  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], version 1, provides 17 authentication modes that can be used as the basis for Web services security configuration. Each mode is optimized for a common set of deployment requirements, such as:  \n  \n-   Credentials used to authenticate client and service.  \n  \n-   Message or transport security protection mechanisms.  \n  \n-   Message exchange patterns.  \n  \n|Authentication Mode|Client Authentication|Server Authentication|Mode|  \n|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------|  \n|UserNameOverTransport|User name/password|X509|Transport|  \n|CertificateOverTransport|X509|X509|Transport|  \n|KerberosOverTransport|Windows|X509|Transport|  \n|IssuedTokenOverTransport|Federated|X509|Transport|  \n|SspiNegotiatedOverTransport|Windows Sspi Negotiated|Windows Sspi Negotiated|Transport|  \n|AnonymousForCertificate|None|X509|Message|  \n|UserNameForCertificate|User name/password|X509|Message|  \n|MutualCertificate|X509|X509|Message|  \n|MutualCertificateDuplex|X509|X509|Message|  \n|IssuedTokenForCertificate|Federated|X509|Message|  \n|Kerberos|Windows|Windows|Message|  \n|IssuedToken|Federated|Federated|Message|  \n|SspiNegotiated|Windows Sspi Negotiated|Windows Sspi Negotiated|Message|  \n|AnonymousForSslNegotiated|None|X509, TLS-Nego|Message|  \n|UserNameForSslNegotiated|User name/password|X509, TLS-Nego|Message|  \n|MutualSslNegotiated|X509|X509, TLS-Nego|Message|  \n|IssuedTokenForSslNegotiated|Federated|X509, TLS-Nego|Message|  \n  \n Endpoints using such authentication modes can express their security requirements using WS-SecurityPolicy (WS-SP). This document describes the structure of security header and infrastructure messages for each authentication mode and provides examples of policies and messages.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] leverages WS-SecureConversation to provide secure sessions support to protect multi-message exchanges between applications.  See \"Secure Sessions\" below for implementation details.  \n  \n In addition to authentication modes, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] provides settings to control common protection mechanisms that apply to most message security-based authentication modes, for example: order of signature versus encryption operations, algorithm suites, key derivation, and signature confirmation.  \n  \n The following prefixes and namespaces are used in this document.  \n  \n|Prefix|Namespace|  \n|------------|---------------|  \n|s|http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope|  \n|sp|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy|  \n|a|http://www.w3.org/2005/08/addressing|  \n|wsse|TBD – OASIS WSS 1.0 URI|  \n|wsse11|TBD – OASIS WSS 1.1 URI|  \n|wsu|TBD – OASIS WSS 1.0 Utility URI|  \n|ds|TBD – W3C XMLDSig URI|  \n|wst|TBD – WS-Trust 2005/02 URI|  \n|wssc|TBD – WS-SecureConversation 2005/02 URI|  \n|wsaw|TBD - WS-Addressing policy namespace|  \n|wsp|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/policy|  \n|mssp|http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy|  \n  \n## 1. Token Profiles  \n Web Services Security specifications represent credential as security tokens. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports the following token types:  \n  \n### 1.1 UsernameToken  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] follows UsernameToken10 and UsernameToken11 profiles with the following constraints:  \n  \n R1101 PasswordType attribute on UsernameToken\\Password element MUST be either omitted or have value #PasswordText (default).  \n  \n One can implement the #PasswordDigest using extensibility. It has been observed that #PasswordDigest was often mistaken to be a secure enough password protection mechanism. But #PasswordDigest cannot serve as a substitute for encryption of the UsernameToken. The primary goal of #PasswordDigest is protection against replay attacks. In [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] authentication modes, replay attack threats are mitigated by using message signatures.  \n  \n B1102 [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] never emits Nonce and Created sub-elements of the UsernameToken.  \n  \n These sub-elements are intended to help replay detection. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] uses message signatures instead.  \n  \n OASIS WSS SOAP Message Security UsernameToken Profile 1.1 (UsernameToken11) introduced key derivation from password feature.  \n  \n B1103 UsernameToken password MUST not be used for key derivation and therefore for cryptographic operations.  \n  \n Rationale: passwords are generally considered too weak to be used for cryptographic operations.  \n  \n### 1.2 X509 Token  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports X509v3 certificates as a credential type and follows X509TokenProfile1.0 and X509TokenProfile1.1 with the following constraints:  \n  \n R1201 The ValueType attribute on the BinarySecurityToken element must have value #X509v3 when it contains an X509v3 certificate.  \n  \n WSS X509 Token Profile 1.0 and 1.1 define also #X509PKIPathv1 and #PKCS7 as value types. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] does not support these types.  \n  \n R1202 If a SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) extension is present in an X509 certificate, wsse:KeyIdentifier should be used for external references to the token, with the ValueType attribute as #X509SubjectKeyIdentifier and its content the base64-encoded value of certificate's SKI extension.  \n  \n SKI references are widely implemented and proven to be a highly interoperable external reference type.  \n  \n R1203 An external Reference to X509 Security Token SHOULD NOT use ds:X509IssuerSerial.  \n  \n R1204 If X509TokenProfile1.1 is in use, an external reference to X509 Security Token SHOULD use the thumbprint introduced by WS-Security 1.1.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports X509IssuerSerial. However There are interoperability issues with X509IssuerSerial: [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] uses a string to compare two values of X509IssuerSerial. Therefore if one reorders components of the Subject Name and sends to an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service a reference to a certificate, it may not be found.  \n  \n### 1.3 Kerberos Token  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports KerberosTokenProfile1.1 for the purpose of Windows authentication with the following constraints:  \n  \n R1301 A Kerberos Token must carry the value of a GSS wrapped Kerberos v4 AP_REQ as defined in GSS_API and the Kerberos specification, and must have the ValueType attribute with the value #GSS_Kerberosv5_AP_REQ.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] uses GSS wrapped Kerberos AP-REQ, not a bare AP-REQ. This is a security best practice.  \n  \n### 1.4 SAML v1.1 Token  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports WSS SAML Token profiles 1.0 and 1.1 for SAML v1.1 tokens. It is possible to implement other versions of SAML token formats.  \n  \n### 1.5 Security Context Token  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports the Security Context Token (SCT) introduced in WS-SecureCoversation. SCT is used to represent a security context established in SecureConversation as well as the binary negotiation protocols TLS and SSPI, described below.  \n  \n## 2. Common Message Security Parameters  \n  \n### 2.1 TimeStamp  \n Timestamp presence is controlled using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.IncludeTimestamp%2A> property of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] always serializes wsse:TimeStamp with wsse:Created and wsse:Expires fields. The wsse:TimeStamp is always signed when signing is used.  \n  \n### 2.2 Protection Order  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports the message protection order \"Sign Before Encrypt\" and \"Encrypt Before Sign\" (Security Policy 1.1). \"Sign Before Encrypt\" is recommended for reasons including: messages protected with Encrypt Before Sign are open to signature substitution attacks unless the WS-Security 1.1 SignatureConfirmation mechanism is used, and a signature over encrypted content makes auditing harder.  \n  \n### 2.3 Signature Protection  \n When Encrypt Before Sign is used, it is recommended to protect the signature to prevent brute force attacks for guessing the encrypted content or the signing key (especially when a custom token is used with weak key material).  \n  \n### 2.4 Algorithm Suite  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports all algorithm suites listed in Security Policy 1.1.  \n  \n### 2.5 Key Derivation  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] uses \"Key Derivation for symmetric keys\" as described in WS-SecureConversation.  \n  \n### 2.6 Signature Confirmation  \n Signature confirmation can be as protection from middle man attacks to protect the set of signatures.  \n  \n### 2.7 Security Header Layout  \n Each authentication mode describes a certain layout for the security header. Elements within the security header are semi-ordered. To define the order of security header child elements, WS-Security Policy defines the following security header layout modes:  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Strict|Items are added to the security header following the numbered layout rules described in Security Policy section 7.7.1 according to a general principle of \"declare before use\".|  \n|Lax|Items are added to the security header in any order that conforms to WSS: SOAP Message Security.|  \n|LaxTimestampFirst|Same as Lax except that the first item in the security header must be a wsse:Timestamp|  \n|LaxTimestampLast|Same as lax except that the last item in the security header must be a wsse:Timestamp|  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports all four modes for security header layout. Security header structure and message examples for authentication modes below follow the \"Strict\" mode.  \n  \n## 2. Common Message Security Parameters  \n This section provides example policies for each authentication mode along with examples showing security header structure in messages exchanged by client and service.  \n  \n### 6.1 Transport Protection  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] provides five authentication modes that use secure transport to protect messages; UserNameOverTransport, CertificateOverTransport, KerberosOverTransport, IssuedTokenOverTransport and SspiNegotiatedOverTransport.  \n  \n These authentication modes are constructed using the transport binding described in SecurityPolicy. For the UserNameOverTransport authentication mode the UsernameToken is a signed supporting token. For the other authentication modes the token appears as a signed endorsing token. Appendix C.1.2 and C.1.3 of SecurityPolicy describe the security header layout in detail. The following example security headers show the Strict layout for a given authentication mode.  \n  \n The value of the \"Derived Keys\" property for the tokens in all cases is \"false\".  \n  \n The values of the various properties of the transport binding are as follows:  \n  \n Timestamp: true  \n  \n Security Header Layout: Strict  \n  \n Algorithm Suite: Basic256  \n  \n#### 6.1.1 UsernameOverTransport  \n With this authentication mode, the client authenticates with a Username Token which appears at the SOAP layer as a signed supporting token that is always sent from the initiator to the recipient. The service is authenticated using an X.509 certificate at the transport layer. The binding used is a transport binding.  \n  \n Policy  \n  \n```  \n<wsp:Policy wsu:Id='UsernameOverTransport_policy' >  \n  <wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n    <wsp:All>  \n      <sp:TransportBinding >  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:TransportToken>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:HttpsToken RequireClientCertificate='false' />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:TransportToken>  \n          <sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Basic256 />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n          <sp:Layout>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Strict />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:Layout>  \n          <sp:IncludeTimestamp />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:TransportBinding>  \n      <sp:SignedSupportingTokens >  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:UsernameToken   \nsp:IncludeToken='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient' >  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:WssUsernameToken10 />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:UsernameToken>  \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:SignedSupportingTokens>  \n      <sp:Wss11 >  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportRefKeyIdentifier />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefIssuerSerial />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefThumbprint />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefEncryptedKey />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Wss11>  \n      <sp:Trust10 >  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportIssuedTokens />   \n          <sp:RequireClientEntropy />   \n          <sp:RequireServerEntropy />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Trust10>  \n      <wsaw:UsingAddressing />   \n    </wsp:All>  \n  </wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n</wsp:Policy>  \n```  \n  \n Security Header Layout  \n  \n Request  \n  \n```  \n<wsse:Security>  \n  <wsu:Timestamp u:Id=\"_0\">  \n  ...  \n  </wsu:Timestamp>  \n  <wsse:UsernameToken ... >  \n  ...  \n  </wsse:UsernameToken>  \n</wsse:Security>  \n```  \n  \n Response  \n  \n```  \n<wsse:Security>  \n  <wsu:Timestamp u:Id=\"_0\">  \n  ...  \n  </wsu:Timestamp>  \n</wsse:Security>  \n```  \n  \n#### 6.1.2 CertificateOverTransport  \n With this authentication mode the client authenticates using an X.509 certificate which appears at the SOAP layer as an endorsing supporting token that is always sent from the initiator to the recipient.

For example, there was no way to provide signature and encryption protection for messages using only service X509 token. \"WSS11\" introduced the usage of EncryptedKey as a symmetric token. Now a temporary key encrypted for the service's X.509 certificate could be used for both request and response messages protection. The authentication modes described in the section 6.4 below use this pattern.  \n  \n WS-SecurityPolicy describes this pattern using SymmetricBinding with Service X509 token as the protection token.  \n  \n Authentication modes AnonymousForCertificate, UsernameForCertificate, MutualCertificate WSS11 and IssuedTokenForCertificate all use a similar instance of sp:SymmetricBinding with the following property values:  \n  \n Protection Token: Server’s X509 Certificate, inclusion mode is set to .../IncludeToken/Never  \nToken Protection: False  \n  \n Entire Header And Body Signatures: True  \n  \n Protection Order: SignBeforeEncrypt  \n  \n Encrypt Signature: True  \n  \n The above authentication modes only differ by the supporting tokens they use. AnonymousForCertificate does not have any supporting tokens, MutualCertificate WSS 1.1 has the client’s X509 certificate as an endorsing supporting tokens, UserNameForCertificate has a UserName Token as a signed supporting token and IssuedTokenForCertificate has the issued token as an endorsing supporting token.  \n  \n Policy  \n  \n Symmetric Binding  \n  \n```  \n<wsp:Policy wsu:Id='SymmetricCert_policy' >  \n  <wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n    <wsp:All>  \n      <sp:SymmetricBinding>  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:ProtectionToken>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:X509Token   \nsp:IncludeToken='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/Never' >  \n                <wsp:Policy>  \n                  <sp:RequireDerivedKeys />   \n                  <sp:RequireThumbprintReference />   \n                  <sp:WssX509V3Token10 />   \n                </wsp:Policy>  \n              </sp:X509Token>  \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:ProtectionToken>  \n          <sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Basic256 />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n          <sp:Layout>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Strict />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:Layout>  \n          <sp:IncludeTimestamp />   \n          <sp:EncryptSignature />   \n          <sp:OnlySignEntireHeadersAndBody />  \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:SymmetricBinding>  \n      <!-- Supporting Token Assertions appear here -->  \n      ...  \n      <sp:Wss11>  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportRefKeyIdentifier />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefIssuerSerial />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefThumbprint />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefEncryptedKey />   \n          <sp:RequireSignatureConfirmation />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Wss11>  \n      <sp:Trust10>  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportIssuedTokens />   \n          <sp:RequireClientEntropy />   \n          <sp:RequireServerEntropy />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Trust10>  \n      <wsaw:UsingAddressing />   \n    </wsp:All>  \n  </wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n</wsp:Policy>  \n```  \n  \n#### 6.2.4 AnonymousForCertificate  \n With this authentication mode the client is anonymous and the service is authenticated using an X.509 certificate.

Details of the TLS handshake implementation using WS-Trust are described in TLSNEGO. Here in the message examples we will assume that SCT with an associated security context is already established through a handshake.  \n  \n The binding used is a symmetric binding with the following properties;  \n  \n Protection Token: SslContextToken, inclusion mode is set to .../IncludeToken/Never  \nToken Protection: False  \n  \n Entire Header And Body Signatures: True  \n  \n Protection Order: SignBeforeEncrypt  \n  \n Encrypt Signature: True  \n  \n#### 6.5.1 Policy for SslNegotiated service authentication  \n Policy for all authentication modes in this section are similar and differ only by specific signed supporting or endorsing tokens used.  \n  \n```  \n<wsp:Policy wsu:Id='SslNegotiated_policy' >  \n  <wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n    <wsp:All>  \n      <sp:SymmetricBinding>  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:ProtectionToken>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <mssp:SslContextToken sp:IncludeToken='http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient' />  \n                <wsp:Policy>  \n                  <sp:RequireDerivedKeys />   \n                </wsp:Policy>  \n              </mssp:SslContextToken>  \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:ProtectionToken>  \n          <sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Basic256 />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:AlgorithmSuite>  \n          <sp:Layout>  \n            <wsp:Policy>  \n              <sp:Strict />   \n            </wsp:Policy>  \n          </sp:Layout>  \n          <sp:IncludeTimestamp />   \n          <sp:EncryptSignature />   \n          <sp:OnlySignEntireHeadersAndBody />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:SymmetricBinding>  \n      <!-- Supporting token assertions go here -->  \n      ..  \n      <sp:Wss11>   \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportRefKeyIdentifier />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefIssuerSerial />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefThumbprint />   \n          <sp:MustSupportRefEncryptedKey />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Wss11>  \n      <sp:Trust10>  \n        <wsp:Policy>  \n          <sp:MustSupportIssuedTokens />   \n          <sp:RequireClientEntropy />   \n          <sp:RequireServerEntropy />   \n        </wsp:Policy>  \n      </sp:Trust10>  \n      <wsaw:UsingAddressing />   \n    </wsp:All>  \n  </wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n</wsp:Policy>  \n```  \n  \n#### 6.5.2 AnonymousForSslNegotiated  \n With this authentication mode the client is anonymous and the service is authenticated using an X.509 certificate.

The SCT is negotiated using WS-Trust (WS-Trust) or WS-SecureConversation (WS-SC) according to a nested binding, which is itself a symmetric binding that uses a negotiation protocol. The negotiation protocol will use Kerberos to perform client and server authentication if possible. If Kerberos cannot be used, it will fall back to NTLM.  \n  \n Policy  \n  \n```  \n<wsp:Policy wsu:Id='SecureConversation_policy' >  \n  <wsp:ExactlyOne>  \n    <wsp:All>  \n
