It is a lot of extra work to create a new type just to use in the projection. A more efficient approach in this case is to project to an anonymous type. Anonymous types allow you to define a class, then declare and initialize an object of that class, without giving the class a name.  \n  \n Anonymous types are the C# implementation of the mathematical concept of a *tuple*. The mathematical term tuple originated from the sequence single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, n-tuple. It refers to a finite sequence of objects, each of a specific type. Sometimes this is called a list of name/value pairs. For example, the contents of an address in the [Sample XML File: Typical Purchase Order (LINQ to XML)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-typical-purchase-order-linq-to-xml-1.md) XML document could be expressed as follows:  \n  \n```  \nName: Ellen Adams  \nStreet: 123 Maple Street  \nCity: Mill Valley  \nState: CA  \nZip: 90952  \nCountry: USA  \n```  \n  \n When you create an instance of an anonymous type, it is convenient to think of it as creating a tuple of order n. If you write a query that creates a tuple in the `select` clause, the query returns an `IEnumerable` of the tuple.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, the `select` clause projects an anonymous type. The example then uses `var` to create the `IEnumerable` object. Within the `foreach` loop, the iteration variable becomes an instance of the anonymous type created in the query expression.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-customers-and-orders-linq-to-xml-2.md).  \n  \n```csharp  \nXElement custOrd = XElement.Load(\"CustomersOrders.xml\");  \nvar custList =  \n    from el in custOrd.Element(\"Customers\").Elements(\"Customer\")  \n    select new {  \n        CustomerID = (string)el.Attribute(\"CustomerID\"),  \n        CompanyName = (string)el.Element(\"CompanyName\"),  \n        ContactName = (string)el.Element(\"ContactName\")  \n    };  \nforeach (var cust in custList)  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"{0}:{1}:{2}\", cust.CustomerID, cust.CompanyName, cust.ContactName);  \n```  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nGREAL:Great Lakes Food Market:Howard Snyder  \nHUNGC:Hungry Coyote Import Store:Yoshi Latimer  \nLAZYK:Lazy K Kountry Store:John Steel  \nLETSS:Let's Stop N Shop:Jaime Yorres  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Projections and
