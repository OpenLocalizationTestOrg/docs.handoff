You can define appearance and formatting styles for individual cells, for cells in specific columns and rows, or for all cells in the control by setting the properties of the `DataGridViewCellStyle` objects accessed through various `DataGridView` control properties. Additionally, you can modify these styles dynamically based on factors such as the cell value by handling the `CellFormatting` event.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Change the Border and Gridline Styles in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](change-the-border-and-gridline-styles-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to set `DataGridView` properties that define the appearance of the control border and the boundary lines between cells.  \n  \n [Cell Styles in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](cell-styles-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes the `DataGridViewCellStyle` class and how properties of that type interact to define how cells are displayed in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Set Default Cell Styles for the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-set-default-cell-styles-for-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to use `DataGridViewCellStyle` properties to define the default appearance of cells in specific rows and columns and in the entire control.  \n  \n [How to: Format Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-format-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how

Control](how-to-set-font-and-color-styles-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to use the `DefaultCellStyle` property to set basic display characteristics for all cells in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Set Alternating Row Styles for the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-set-alternating-row-styles-for-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to create a ledger-like effect in the control using alternating rows that are displayed differently.  \n  \n [How to: Use the Row Template to Customize Rows in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](use-the-row-template-to-customize-rows-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to use the `RowTemplate` property to set row properties that will be used for all rows in the control.  \n  \n##
