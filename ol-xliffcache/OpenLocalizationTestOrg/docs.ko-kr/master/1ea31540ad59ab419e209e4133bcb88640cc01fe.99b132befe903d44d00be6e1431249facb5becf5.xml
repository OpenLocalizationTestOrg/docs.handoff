A drawing context is returned by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual.RenderOpen%2A> method of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual> object. You can draw graphics and text into a drawing context.  \n  \n To draw text into the drawing context, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.DrawText%2A> method of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext> object. When you are finished drawing content into the drawing context, call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.Close%2A> method to close the drawing context and persist the content.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[DrawingVisualSample#110](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingVisualSample/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#110)]\n [!code-vb[DrawingVisualSample#110](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingVisualSample/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#110)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For the complete code sample from which the preceding code example was extracted, see [Hit Test Using DrawingVisuals Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159994).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,328],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Text to a Visual\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"typography [WPF], drawing text to visuals\"\n  - \"visuals [WPF], drawing text to\"\n  - \"text [WPF], drawing to visuals\"\n  - \"drawing [WPF], text to visuals\"\nms.assetid: fee4003c-e8a6-46ec-babd-2c7f4231a101","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[335,364],"content":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","linkify":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text to a Visual","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to draw text to a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual&gt;</ph> using a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[365,515],"source":"The following example shows how to draw text to a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual> using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext> object."},{"content":"A drawing context is returned by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual.RenderOpen%2A&gt;</ph> method of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[516,678],"source":" A drawing context is returned by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual.RenderOpen%2A> method of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingVisual> object."},{"content":"You can draw graphics and text into a drawing context.","pos":[679,733]},{"content":"To draw text into the drawing context, use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.DrawText%2A&gt;</ph> method of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[740,904],"source":"To draw text into the drawing context, use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.DrawText%2A> method of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext> object."},{"content":"When you are finished drawing content into the drawing context, call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.Close%2A&gt;</ph> method to close the drawing context and persist the content.","pos":[905,1090],"source":" When you are finished drawing content into the drawing context, call the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext.Close%2A> method to close the drawing context and persist the content."},{"pos":[1099,1106],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1384,1568],"content":"[!NOTE]\n For the complete code sample from which the preceding code example was extracted, see [Hit Test Using DrawingVisuals Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159994).","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"For the complete code sample from which the preceding code example was extracted, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Hit Test Using DrawingVisuals Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159994)</ept>.","pos":[9,182],"source":"For the complete code sample from which the preceding code example was extracted, see [Hit Test Using DrawingVisuals Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159994)."}]}]}
