In later topics, you will access the OData feed by using a Web browser, and also create a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) client application that consumes the OData feed by using client libraries.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this quickstart, you must install the following components:\n\n- Visual Studio\n\n- An instance of SQL Server. This includes SQL Server Express, which is included in a default installation of Visual Studio 2015, or as part of the **Data storage and processing** workload in Visual Studio 2017.\n\n- The Northwind sample database. To download this sample database, see the download page, [Sample Databases for SQL Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=24758).\n\n## WCF data services quickstart tasks\n\n [Create the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-data-service.md)\n\n Define the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application, define the data model, create the data service, and enable access to resources.\n\n [Access the Service from a Web Browser](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/accessing-the-service-from-a-web-browser-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)\n\n Start the service from Visual Studio and access the service by submitting HTTP GET requests through a Web browser to the exposed feed.\n\n [Create the .NET Framework Client Application](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-dotnet-client-application-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)\n\n Create a WPF app to consume the OData feed, bind data to Windows controls, change data in the bound controls, and then send the changes back to the data service.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Project files from a completed version of the quickstart can be downloaded from the [WCF Data Services Documentation Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179994) page.\n\n## Next steps\n\n> [!div class=\"nextstepaction\"]\n> [Start the
