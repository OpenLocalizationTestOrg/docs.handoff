The contents of the table are apportioned into five rows (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRow> objects contained in a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table.RowGroups%2A> object) and six columns (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableColumn> objects). The rows are used for different presentation purposes, including a title row intended to title the entire table, a header row to describe the columns of data in the table, and a footer row with summary information.  Note that the notion of \"title\", \"header\", and \"footer\" rows are not inherent to the table; these are simply rows with different characteristics. Table cells contain the actual content, which can be comprised of text, images, or nearly any other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] element.  \n  \n## Example  \n First, a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument> is created to host the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table>, and a new <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table> is created and added to the contents of the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.FlowDocument>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TableSnippets#_TableCreate](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/CSharp/Table.cs#_tablecreate)]\n [!code-vb[TableSnippets#_TableCreate](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/VisualBasic/Table.vb#_tablecreate)]  \n  \n## Example  \n Next, six <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableColumn> objects are created and added to the table's <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table.Columns%2A> collection, with some formatting applied.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Note that the table's <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table.Columns%2A> collection uses standard zero-based indexing.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TableSnippets#_TableCreateColumns](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/CSharp/Table.cs#_tablecreatecolumns)]\n [!code-vb[TableSnippets#_TableCreateColumns](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/VisualBasic/Table.vb#_tablecreatecolumns)]  \n  \n## Example  \n Next, a title row is created and added to the table with some formatting applied.

Building this row is similar to building the header row, with slightly different formatting applied.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TableSnippets#_TableAddDataRow](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/CSharp/Table.cs#_tableadddatarow)]\n [!code-vb[TableSnippets#_TableAddDataRow](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippets/VisualBasic/Table.vb#_tableadddatarow)]  \n  \n## Example  \n Finally, a footer row is created, added, and formatted.
