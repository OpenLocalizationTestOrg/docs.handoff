Once you have placed all the controls where you want them on the form, lock them all in place to prevent erroneous movement.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To lock a control  \n  \n1.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Locked** property and select `true`. (Double-clicking the name toggles the property setting.)  \n  \n     Alternatively, right-click the control and choose **Lock Controls**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Locking controls prevents them from being dragged to a new size or location on the design surface. However, you can still change the size or location of controls by means of the **Properties** window or in code.  \n  \n### To lock all the controls on a form  \n  \n1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Lock Controls**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This command locks the form's size as well, because a form is a control.  \n  \n### To unlock all locked controls on a form  \n  \n1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Lock Controls**.  \n  \n     All previously locked controls on the form are now unlocked.  \n  \n### To unlock locked controls individually  \n  \n1.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Locked** property and select `false`.
