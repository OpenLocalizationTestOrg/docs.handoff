The supported OS versions and depdendencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the [command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md), [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/).\n\n## Supported macOS versions\n\n.NET Core is supported by the following versions of macOS:\n\n* macOS 10.12 \"Sierra\"\n* macOS 10.11 \"El Capitan\"\n\nSee the [.NET Core Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.1/1.1.md) for the complete list of supported operating systems.\n\n## .NET Core dependencies\n\n.NET Core requires OpenSSL when running on macOS. An easy way to obtain OpenSSL is by using the [Homebrew (\"brew\")](https://brew.sh/) package manager for macOS. After installing *brew*, install OpenSSL by executing the following commands at a Terminal (command) prompt:\n\n```Terminal\nbrew update\nbrew install openssl\nmkdir -p /usr/local/lib\nln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/\nln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/\n```\n\nAfter installing OpenSSL, download and install the .NET Core SDK from [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core). If you have problems with the installation on macOS, consult the [Known issues & workarounds](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/cli/known-issues.md) topic.\n\n## Visual Studio for Mac\n\n.NET Core development on macOS with Visual Studio for Mac requires:\n\n* A supported version of the macOS operating system\n* OpenSSL\n* .NET Core SDK for Mac\n* [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,62],"content":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,51]}]},{"pos":[76,197],"content":"Supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines.","pos":[0,121]}]},{"pos":[208,235],"content":".NET, .NET Core, macOS, Mac","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, macOS, Mac","pos":[0,27]}]},{"pos":[403,437],"content":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac","linkify":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac","nodes":[{"content":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"This article shows you the supported macOS versions and .NET Core dependencies that you need to develop, deploy, and run .NET Core applications on macOS machines.","pos":[439,601]},{"content":"The supported OS versions and depdendencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>command-line with your favorite editor<ept id=\"p1\">](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md)</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)<ept id=\"p2\">](https://code.visualstudio.com/)</ept>, and <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>Visual Studio for Mac<ept id=\"p3\">](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)</ept>.","pos":[602,950],"source":" The supported OS versions and depdendencies that follow apply to the three ways of developing .NET Core apps on a Mac: via the [command-line with your favorite editor](tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli.md), [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/)."},{"pos":[955,979],"content":"Supported macOS versions","linkify":"Supported macOS versions","nodes":[{"content":"Supported macOS versions","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":".NET Core is supported by the following versions of macOS:","pos":[981,1039]},{"content":"macOS 10.12 \"Sierra\"","pos":[1043,1063]},{"content":"macOS 10.11 \"El Capitan\"","pos":[1066,1090]},{"pos":[1092,1248],"content":"See the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>.NET Core Release Notes<ept id=\"p1\">](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.1/1.1.md)</ept> for the complete list of supported operating systems.","source":"See the [.NET Core Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/1.1/1.1.md) for the complete list of supported operating systems."},{"pos":[1253,1275],"content":".NET Core dependencies","linkify":".NET Core dependencies","nodes":[{"content":".NET Core dependencies","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":".NET Core requires OpenSSL when running on macOS.","pos":[1277,1326]},{"content":"An easy way to obtain OpenSSL is by using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Homebrew (\"brew\")<ept id=\"p1\">](https://brew.sh/)</ept> package manager for macOS.","pos":[1327,1437],"source":" An easy way to obtain OpenSSL is by using the [Homebrew (\"brew\")](https://brew.sh/) package manager for macOS."},{"content":"After installing <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>brew<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, install OpenSSL by executing the following commands at a Terminal (command) prompt:","pos":[1438,1546],"source":" After installing *brew*, install OpenSSL by executing the following commands at a Terminal (command) prompt:"},{"content":"After installing OpenSSL, download and install the .NET Core SDK from <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>.NET Downloads<ept id=\"p1\">](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)</ept>.","pos":[1761,1893],"source":"After installing OpenSSL, download and install the .NET Core SDK from [.NET Downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)."},{"content":"If you have problems with the installation on macOS, consult the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Known issues &amp;
