You define enums when you need to define a type that can have a set of discrete values. They use one of the integral value types as their underlying storage. They provide semantic meaning to the discrete values.\n\nThe following example declares and uses an `enum` type named `Color` with three constant values, `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`.\n\n[!code-csharp[EnumExample](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L3-L36)]\n\nEach `enum` type has a corresponding integral type called the ***underlying type*** of the `enum` type. An `enum` type that does not explicitly declare an underlying type has an underlying type of `int`. An `enum` type’s storage format and range of possible values are determined by its underlying type. The set of values that an `enum` type can take on is not limited by its `enum` members. In particular, any value of the underlying type of an `enum` can be cast to the `enum` type and is a distinct valid value of that `enum` type.\n\nThe following example declares an `enum` type named `Alignment` with an underlying type of `sbyte`.\n\n[!code-csharp[EnumStorage](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L38-L43)]\n\nAs shown by the previous example, an `enum` member declaration can include a constant expression that specifies the value of the member. The constant value for each `enum` member must be in the range of the underlying type of the `enum`. When an `enum` member declaration does not explicitly specify a value, the member is given the value zero (if it is the first member in the `enum` type) or the value of the textually preceding `enum` member plus one.\n\n`Enum` values can be converted to integral values and vice versa using type casts. For example:\n\n[!code-csharp[EnumStorage](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L49-L50)]\n\nThe default value of any `enum` type is the integral value zero converted to the `enum` type. In cases where variables are automatically initialized to a default value, this is the value given to variables of `enum` types. In order for the default value of an `enum` type to be easily available, the literal `0` implicitly converts to any `enum` type. Thus, the following is permitted.\n\n[!code-csharp[EnumZero](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/enums/Program.cs#L58-L58)]\n\n>[!div
