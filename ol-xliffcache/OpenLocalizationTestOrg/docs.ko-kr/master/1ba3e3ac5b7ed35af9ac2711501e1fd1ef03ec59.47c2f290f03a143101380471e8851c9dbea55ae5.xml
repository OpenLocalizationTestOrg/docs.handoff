Properties define the shape and characteristics of data that an entity type instance or complex type instance will contain. Properties in a conceptual model are analogous to properties defined on a class. In the same way that properties on a class define the shape of the class and carry information about objects, properties in a conceptual model define the shape of an entity type and carry information about entity type instances.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Properties, as described in this topic, are different from navigation properties. For more information, see [navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md).  \n  \n A property definition contains the following information:  \n  \n-   A property name. (Required)  \n  \n-   A property type. (Required)  \n  \n-   A set of [facets](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/facet.md). (Optional)  \n  \n A property can contain primitive data (such as a string, an integer, or a Boolean value), or structured data (such as a complex type). Properties that are of primitive type are also called scalar properties. For more information, see [Entity Data Model: Primitive Data Types](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-primitive-data-types.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A complex type can, itself, have properties that are complex types.  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with three entity types: `Book`, `Publisher`, and `Author`. Each entity type has several properties, although type information for each property is not conveyed in the diagram. Properties that are [entity keys](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-key.md) are denoted with (Key).  \n  \n ![Example Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/examplemodel.gif \"ExampleModel\")  \n  \n The [ADO.NET Entity Framework](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines the `Book` entity type (as shown in the diagram above) and indicates the type and name of each property by using XML attributes. An optional facet, `Nullable`, is also defined by using an XML attribute.  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#EntityExample](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books.edmx#entityexample)]  \n  \n It is possible that one of the properties shown in the diagram is a complex type property. For example, the `Address` property on the `Publisher` entity type could be a complex type property composed of several scalar properties, such as `StreetAddress`, `City`, `StateOrProvince`, `Country`, and `PostalCode`. The CSDL representation of such a complex type would be as follows:  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#ComplexTypeExample](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books2.edmx#complextypeexample)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)   \n [Entity Data Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,339],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"property | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: a941c53f-fc97-42c2-8832-0fb9f1d55c06\ncaps.latest.revision: 3\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","nodes":[{"content":"property | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"property | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"property | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[346,354],"content":"property","linkify":"property","nodes":[{"content":"property","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> are the fundamental building blocks of <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>entity types<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>complex types<ept id=\"p3\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/complex-type.md)</ept>.","pos":[355,553],"source":"*Properties* are the fundamental building blocks of [entity types](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) and [complex types](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/complex-type.md)."},{"content":"Properties define the shape and characteristics of data that an entity type instance or complex type instance will contain.","pos":[554,677]},{"content":"Properties in a conceptual model are analogous to properties defined on a class.","pos":[678,758]},{"content":"In the same way that properties on a class define the shape of the class and carry information about objects, properties in a conceptual model define the shape of an entity type and carry information about entity type instances.","pos":[759,987]},{"pos":[995,1201],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Properties, as described in this topic, are different from navigation properties.
