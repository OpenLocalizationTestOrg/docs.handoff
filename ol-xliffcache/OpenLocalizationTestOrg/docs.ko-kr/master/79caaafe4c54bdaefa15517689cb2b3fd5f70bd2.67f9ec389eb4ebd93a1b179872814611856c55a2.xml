The class is not intended for use in real-world scenarios. It just uses the name and length in bytes of each file to determine whether the contents of each folder are identical or not. In a real-world scenario, you should modify this comparer to perform a more rigorous equality check.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \nnamespace QueryCompareTwoDirs  \n{  \n    class CompareDirs  \n    {  \n  \n        static void Main(string[] args)  \n        {  \n  \n            // Create two identical or different temporary folders   \n            // on a local drive and change these file paths.  \n            string pathA = @\"C:\\TestDir\";  \n            string pathB = @\"C:\\TestDir2\";  \n  \n            System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir1 = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(pathA);  \n            System.IO.DirectoryInfo dir2 = new System.IO.DirectoryInfo(pathB);  \n  \n            // Take a snapshot of the file system.  \n            IEnumerable<System.IO.FileInfo> list1 = dir1.GetFiles(\"*.*\", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories);  \n            IEnumerable<System.IO.FileInfo> list2 = dir2.GetFiles(\"*.*\", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories);  \n  \n            //A custom file comparer defined below  \n            FileCompare myFileCompare = new FileCompare();  \n  \n            // This query determines whether the two folders contain  \n            // identical file lists, based on the custom file comparer  \n            // that is defined in the FileCompare class.  \n            // The query executes immediately because it returns a bool.  \n            bool areIdentical = list1.SequenceEqual(list2, myFileCompare);  \n  \n            if (areIdentical == true)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"the two folders are the same\");  \n            }  \n            else  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"The two folders are not the same\");  \n            }  \n  \n            // Find the common files. It produces a sequence and doesn't   \n            // execute until the foreach statement.  \n            var queryCommonFiles = list1.Intersect(list2, myFileCompare);  \n  \n            if (queryCommonFiles.Count() > 0)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"The following files are in both folders:\");  \n                foreach (var v in queryCommonFiles)  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(v.FullName); //shows which items end up in result list  \n                }  \n            }  \n            else  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"There are no common files in the two folders.\");  \n            }  \n  \n            // Find the set difference between the two folders.  \n            // For this example we only check one way.  \n            var queryList1Only = (from file in list1  \n                                  select file).Except(list2, myFileCompare);  \n  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The following files are in list1 but not list2:\");  \n            foreach (var v in queryList1Only)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(v.FullName);  \n            }  \n  \n            // Keep the console window open in debug mode.  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\");  \n            Console.ReadKey();  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    // This implementation defines a very simple comparison  \n    // between two FileInfo objects.
