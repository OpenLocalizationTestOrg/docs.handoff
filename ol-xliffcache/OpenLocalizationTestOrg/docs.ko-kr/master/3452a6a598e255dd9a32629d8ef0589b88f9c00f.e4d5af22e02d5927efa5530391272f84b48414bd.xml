The **WCF Web Service Reference** tool is a Visual Studio connected service extension that provides an experience like the Add Service Reference functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects. This tool retrieves metadata from a web service in the current solution, on a network location, or from a WSDL file, and generates a .NET Core compatible source file containing Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client proxy code that you can use to access the web service.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> You should only reference services from a trusted source. Adding references from an untrusted source may compromise security. \n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* [Visual Studio 2017 15.5](https://aka.ms/vsdownload?utm_source=mscom&utm_campaign=msdocs) or later versions\n\n## How to use the extension\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The **WCF Web Service Reference** option is applicable to projects created using the following project templates:\n> * **Visual C#** > **.NET Core**\n> * **Visual C#** > **.NET Standard**\n> * **Visual C#** > **Web** > **ASP.NET Core Web Application**\n\nUsing the **ASP.NET Core Web Application** project template as an example, this article walks you through adding a WCF service reference to the project:\n\n1. In Solution Explorer, double-click the **Connected Services** node of the project (for a .NET Core or .NET Standard project this option is available when you right-click on the **Dependencies** node of the project in Solution Explorer).\n\nThe **Connected Services** page appears as shown in the following image:\n\n![Visual Studio Connected Services tab for .NET Core](./media/wcf-web-service-reference-guide/wcfcs-ConnectedServicesPage.png)\n\n2. On the **Connected Services** page, click **Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider**. This brings up the **Configure WCF Web Service Reference** wizard:\n\n![Visual Studio Service Endpoint tab for .NET Core](./media/wcf-web-service-reference-guide/wcfcs-ServiceEndpointPage.png)\n\n3. Select a service.\n\n    3a. There are several services search options available within the **Configure WCF Web Service Reference** wizard:\n    \n     * To search for services defined in the current solution, click the **Discover** button. \n     * To search for services hosted at a specified address, enter a service URL in the **Address** box and click the **Go** button.\n     * To select a WSDL file that contains the web service metadata information, click the **Browse** button. \n     \n    3b. Select the service from the search results list in the **Services** box. If needed, enter the namespace for the generated code in the corresponding **Namespace** text box.\n    \n    3c. Click the **Next** button to open the **Data Type Options** and the **Client Options** pages. Alternatively, click the **Finish** button to use the default options.\n\n4. The **Data Type Options** formÂ enables you to refine the generated service reference configuration settings:\n\n![Visual Studio Data type options tab for .NET Core](./media/wcf-web-service-reference-guide/wcfcs-DataTypesPage.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The **Reuse types in referenced assemblies** check box option is useful when data types needed for service reference code generation are defined in one of your project's referenced assemblies.  It's important to reuse those existing data types to avoid compile-time type clash or runtime issues.\n\nThere may be a delay while type information is loaded, depending on the number of project dependencies and other system performance factors. The **Finish** button is disabled during loading unless the **Reuse types in referenced assemblies** check box is unchecked.\n\n5. Click **Finish** when you are done.\n\nWhile displaying progress, the tool:\n\n* Downloads metadata from the WCF service. \n* Generates the service reference code in a file named *reference.cs*, and adds it to your project under the **Connected Services** node. \n* Updates the project file (.csproj) with NuGet package references required to compile and run on the target platform.\n\n![Visual Studio Progress window](./media/wcf-web-service-reference-guide/wcfcs-ProgressWindow.png)\n\nWhen these processes complete, you can create an instance of the generated WCF client type and invoke the service operations.\n\n## Next steps\n\n### Feedback & questions\nIf you have any questions or feedback, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/new). You can also review any existing questions or issues [at the WCF repo on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:issue%20label:tooling).\n\n### Release notes\n* Refer to the [Release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/blob/master/release-notes/WCF-Web-Service-Reference-notes.md) for updated release information, including known issues. \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,315],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Add WCF Web Service Reference\ndescription: An overview of the Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool that adds functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects, similar to Add Service Reference for .NET Framework projects.\nauthor: mlacouture\nms.date: 04/19/2018\nms.custom: \"mvc, seodec18\"","nodes":[{"content":"Add WCF Web Service Reference","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Add WCF Web Service Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Add WCF Web Service Reference","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"An overview of the Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool that adds functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects, similar to Add Service Reference for .NET Framework projects.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,195],"content":"An overview of the Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool that adds functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects, similar to Add Service Reference for .NET Framework projects.","nodes":[{"content":"An overview of the Microsoft WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool that adds functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects, similar to Add Service Reference for .NET Framework projects.","pos":[0,195]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[323,370],"content":"Use the WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool","linkify":"Use the WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool","nodes":[{"content":"Use the WCF Web Service Reference Provider Tool","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"Over the years, many Visual Studio developers have enjoyed the productivity that the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Add Service Reference<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept><ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/data-tools/how-to-add-update-or-remove-a-wcf-data-service-reference)</ept> tool provided when their .NET Framework projects needed to access web services.","pos":[372,647],"source":"Over the years, many Visual Studio developers have enjoyed the productivity that the [**Add Service Reference**](/visualstudio/data-tools/how-to-add-update-or-remove-a-wcf-data-service-reference) tool provided when their .NET Framework projects needed to access web services."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>WCF Web Service Reference<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> tool is a Visual Studio connected service extension that provides an experience like the Add Service Reference functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects.","pos":[649,848],"source":"  The **WCF Web Service Reference** tool is a Visual Studio connected service extension that provides an experience like the Add Service Reference functionality for .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects."},{"content":"This tool retrieves metadata from a web service in the current solution, on a network location, or from a WSDL file, and generates a .NET Core compatible source file containing Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client proxy code that you can use to access the web service.","pos":[849,1126]},{"pos":[1130,1270],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\nYou should only reference services from a trusted source.
