Use one of the following options to continue executing instructions while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete:  \n  \n-   Use an <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegate to process the results of the asynchronous operation in a separate thread. This approach is demonstrated in this topic.  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.IsCompleted%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> returned by the asynchronous operation's **Begin** *OperationName* method to determine whether the operation has completed. For an example that demonstrates this approach, see [Polling for the Status of an Asynchronous Operation](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/polling-for-the-status-of-an-asynchronous-operation.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System (DNS) information for user-specified computers. This example creates an <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegate that references the `ProcessDnsInformation` method. This method is called once for each asynchronous request for DNS information.  \n  \n Note that the user-specified host is passed to the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A><xref:System.Object> parameter. For an example that demonstrates defining and using a more complex state object, see [Using an AsyncCallback Delegate and State Object](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/using-an-asynccallback-delegate-and-state-object.md).  \n  \n
