Choose one of the following:  \n  \n    -   Purchase a certificate from a certification authority, such as VeriSign, Inc.  \n  \n    -   Set up your own certificate service and have a certification authority sign the certificates. [!INCLUDE[ws2003](../../../../includes/ws2003-md.md)], Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Server Datacenter, and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server all include certificate services that support public key infrastructure (PKI). In Windows Server 2008, use the [Active Directory Certificate Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=153483) role to manage a certification authority.  \n  \n    -   Set up your own certificate service and do not have the certificates signed.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Whichever approach you take, the recipient of the SOAP request that contains the X.509 certificate must trust the X.509 certificate.
