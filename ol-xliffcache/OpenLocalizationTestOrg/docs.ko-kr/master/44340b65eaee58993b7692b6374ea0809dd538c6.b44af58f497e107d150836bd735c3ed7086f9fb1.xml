These images can be icons that clarify the purpose of the control, such as a diskette icon on a button denoting the **Save** command. Alternatively, the icons can be background images to give the control the appearance and behavior you want.  \n  \n### To set the image displayed by a control  \n  \n1.  Set the control's `Image` or `BackgroundImage` property to an object of type <xref:System.Drawing.Image>. Generally, you will be loading the image from a file by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile%2A> method.  \n  \n     In the following code example, the path set for the location of the image is the **My Pictures** folder. Most computers running the Windows operating system will include this directory. This also enables users with minimal system access levels to run the application safely. The following code example requires that you already have a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control added.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' Replace the image named below  \n    ' with an icon of your own choosing.  \n    PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile _  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath _  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.MyPictures) _  \n       & \"\\Image.gif\")  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Replace the image named below  \n    // with an icon of your own choosing.  \n    // Note the escape character used (@) when specifying the path.  \n    pictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.MyPictures)  \n       + @\"\\Image.gif\");  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    // Replace the image named below  \n    // with an icon of your own choosing.  \n    pictureBox1->Image = Image::FromFile(String::Concat  \n       (System::Environment::GetFolderPath  \n       (System::Environment::SpecialFolder::MyPictures),  \n       \"\\\\Image.gif\"));  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile%2A>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.Image>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,87],"content":"How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,75]}]},{"pos":[662,720],"content":"How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control","linkify":"How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"Several Windows Forms controls can display images.","pos":[721,771]},{"content":"These images can be icons that clarify the purpose of the control, such as a diskette icon on a button denoting the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Save<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> command.","pos":[772,905],"source":" These images can be icons that clarify the purpose of the control, such as a diskette icon on a button denoting the **Save** command."},{"content":"Alternatively, the icons can be background images to give the control the appearance and behavior you want.","pos":[906,1013]},{"pos":[1023,1062],"content":"To set the image displayed by a control","linkify":"To set the image displayed by a control","nodes":[{"content":"To set the image displayed by a control","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Set the control's <ph id=\"ph1\">`Image`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`BackgroundImage`</ph> property to an object of type <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1072,1177],"source":"Set the control's `Image` or `BackgroundImage` property to an object of type <xref:System.Drawing.Image>."},{"content":"Generally, you will be loading the image from a file by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1178,1291],"source":" Generally, you will be loading the image from a file by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.FromFile%2A> method."},{"content":"In the following code example, the path set for the location of the image is the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>My Pictures<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> folder.","pos":[1302,1406],"source":"In the following code example, the path set for the location of the image is the **My Pictures** folder."},{"content":"Most computers running the Windows operating system will include this directory.","pos":[1407,1487]},{"content":"This also enables users with minimal system access levels to run the application safely.","pos":[1488,1576]},{"content":"The following code example requires that you already have a form with a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox&gt;</ph> control added.","pos":[1577,1702],"source":" The following code example requires that you already have a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control added."},{"pos":[2638,2646],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
