Because it cannot be modified in any way, there is no point in passing it by `ref` or `out`. Therefore, both operations are not valid.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Pass the range variable by value.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example generates CS1939:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs1939.cs  \nusing System.Linq;  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    public static void F(ref int i)  \n    {  \n    }  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n        var list = new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };  \n        var q = from x in list  \n                let k = x  \n                select Test.F(ref x); // CS1939  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1939\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1939\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1939\"\nms.assetid: 9a7cdd48-3d45-473a-a799-c7771ef8158d","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1939","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1939","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1939","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1939","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1939","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1939","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Cannot pass the range variable 'name' as an out or ref parameter.","pos":[194,259]},{"content":"A range variable is a read-only variable that is introduced in a query expression and serves as an identifier for each successive element in a source sequence.","pos":[266,425]},{"content":"Because it cannot be modified in any way, there is no point in passing it by <ph id=\"ph1\">`ref`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`out`</ph>.","pos":[426,518],"source":" Because it cannot be modified in any way, there is no point in passing it by `ref` or `out`."},{"content":"Therefore, both operations are not valid.","pos":[519,560]},{"pos":[569,590],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Pass the range variable by value.","pos":[600,633]},{"pos":[642,649],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example generates CS1939:","pos":[653,692]}]}
