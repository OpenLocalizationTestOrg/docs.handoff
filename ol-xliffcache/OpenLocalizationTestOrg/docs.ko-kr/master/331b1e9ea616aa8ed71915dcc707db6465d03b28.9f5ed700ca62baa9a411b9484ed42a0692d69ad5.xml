This section describes how to create custom activities with either method.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Custom activities by default display within the workflow designer as a simple rectangle with the activity’s name. To provide a custom visual representation of your activity in the workflow designer you must also create a custom designer.
