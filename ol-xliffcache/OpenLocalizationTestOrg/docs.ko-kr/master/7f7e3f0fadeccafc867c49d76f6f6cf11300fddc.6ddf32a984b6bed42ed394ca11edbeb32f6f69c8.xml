The textual information displayed for an item in tile view is the same as the column information defined for details view. Tile view functions in combination with either the grouping or insertion mark features in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control.  \n  \n The tile view uses a 32 x 32 icon and several lines of text, as shown in the following image.  \n  \n ![Tile View in a ListView Control](./media/enable-tile-view-in-a-wf-listview-control-using-the-designer/tile-view-in-listview-control.gif \"Tile view icons and text\")  \n  \n Tile view properties and methods enable you to specify which column fields to display for each item, and to collectively control the size and appearance of all items within a tile view window. For clarity, the first line of text in a tile is always the item's name; it cannot be changed.  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The tile view is available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. On earlier operating systems, any code related to the tile view has no effect, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control displays in the large icon view. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n>   \n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To set tile view in the designer  \n  \n1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control on your form.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property and choose **Tile**.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.TileSize%2A>\n- [ListView Control Overview](listview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,313],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"tile view feature\"\n  - \"ListView control [Windows Forms], tile view\"\n  - \"tiling [Windows Forms], Windows Forms, controls\"\nms.assetid: 12f0816a-52b8-41ee-a6d9-ded3a8a5817a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,79],"content":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,79]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[320,399],"content":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Tile View in a Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"The tile view feature of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control enables you to provide a visual balance between graphical and textual information.","pos":[400,556],"source":"The tile view feature of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control enables you to provide a visual balance between graphical and textual information."},{"content":"The textual information displayed for an item in tile view is the same as the column information defined for details view.","pos":[557,679]},{"content":"Tile view functions in combination with either the grouping or insertion mark features in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[680,819],"source":" Tile view functions in combination with either the grouping or insertion mark features in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control."},{"content":"The tile view uses a 32 x 32 icon and several lines of text, as shown in the following image.","pos":[826,919]},{"pos":[926,1091],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Tile View in a ListView Control<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/enable-tile-view-in-a-wf-listview-control-using-the-designer/tile-view-in-listview-control.gif \"</bpt>Tile view icons and text<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Tile View in a ListView Control](./media/enable-tile-view-in-a-wf-listview-control-using-the-designer/tile-view-in-listview-control.gif \"Tile view icons and text\")"},{"content":"Tile view properties and methods enable you to specify which column fields to display for each item, and to collectively control the size and appearance of all items within a tile view window.","pos":[1098,1290]},{"content":"For clarity, the first line of text in a tile is always the item's name; it cannot be changed.","pos":[1291,1385]},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1392,1529],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Forms application project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1530,1790],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1798,2304],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The tile view is available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.
