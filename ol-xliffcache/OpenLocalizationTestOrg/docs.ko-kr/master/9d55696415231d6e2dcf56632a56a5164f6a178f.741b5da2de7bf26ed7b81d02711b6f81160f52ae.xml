WordPad has a certain set of allowed effects for text being dragged and dropped; the Windows-based application you will write code for will work with these effects so that drag-and-drop operations may be completed successfully.  \n  \n### To perform a drag-and-drop procedure between applications  \n  \n1.  Create a new Windows Forms application.  \n  \n2.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control to your form.  \n  \n3.  Configure the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control to receive dropped data.  \n  \n     For more information, see [Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-performing-a-drag-and-drop-operation-in-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n4.  Run your Windows-based application, and while the application is running, run WordPad.  \n  \n     WordPad is a text editor installed by Windows that allows drag-and-drop operations. It is accessible by pressing the **Start** button, selecting **Run**, and then typing `WordPad` into the text box of the **Run** dialog box and clicking **OK**.  \n  \n5.  Once WordPad is open, type a string of text into it.  \n  \n6.  Using the mouse, select the text, and then drag the selected text over to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control in your Windows-based application.  \n  \n     Observe that when you mouse over the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control (and, consequently, raise the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter> event), the cursor changes, and you can drop the selected text into the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control.  \n  \n     Additionally, you can configure your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control to allow text strings to be dragged and dropped into WordPad.
