The topics in this section describe several of the most commonly used of these features.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Hide Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-hide-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to prevent specific columns from appearing in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Hide Column Headers in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-hide-column-headers-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to prevent the column headers from appearing in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-enable-column-reordering-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to enable users to rearrange columns in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Freeze Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-freeze-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how prevent one or more adjacent columns from scrolling.  \n  \n [How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-make-columns-read-only-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to prevent users from editing specific columns in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-datagridview.md)  \n Describes how to remove the row for new records at the bottom of the control to prevent users from adding rows. Also describes how to prevent users from deleting rows.  \n  \n [How to: Get and Set the Current Cell in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/get-and-set-the-current-cell-wf-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to access the cell that currently has focus in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Display Images in Cells of the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-images-in-cells-of-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to create an image column that displays an icon in every cell.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>  \n Provides reference documentation for the control.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Basic Formatting and Styling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/basic-formatting-and-styling-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to modify the basic appearance of
