Use one of the following options to block your application's main thread while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete:  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> returned by the asynchronous operation's **Begin** *OperationName* method. This approach is demonstrated in this topic.  \n  \n-   Call the asynchronous operation's **End** *OperationName* method. For an example that demonstrates this approach, see [Blocking Application Execution by Ending an Async Operation](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/blocking-application-execution-by-ending-an-async-operation.md).  \n  \n Applications that use one or more <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> objects to block until an asynchronous operation is complete will typically call the **Begin** *OperationName* method, perform any work that can be done without the results of the operation, and then block until the asynchronous operation(s) completes. An application can block on a single operation by calling one of the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne%2A> methods using the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A>. To block while waiting for a set of asynchronous operations to complete, store the associated <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> objects in an array and call one of the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A> methods. To block while waiting for any one of a set of asynchronous operations to complete, store the associated <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> objects in an array and call one of the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A> methods.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the DNS class to retrieve Domain Name System information for a user-specified computer. The example demonstrates blocking using the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> associated with the asynchronous operation. Note that `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic) is passed for the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A>`requestCallback` and `stateObject` parameters because these are not required when using this approach.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[AsyncDesignPattern#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AsyncDesignPattern/CS/Async_EndBlockWait.cs#2)]\n
