Create or find an image that you want to use for the splash screen. You can use any image format that is supported by the Windows Imaging Component (WIC). For example, you can use the BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF format.\n\n2.  Add the image file to the WPF Application project.\n\n3.  In **Solution Explorer**, select the image.\n\n4.  In the Properties window, click the drop-down arrow for the **Build Action** property.\n\n5.  Select **SplashScreen** from the drop-down list.\n\n6.  Press **F5** to build and run the application.\n\n     The splash screen image appears in the center of the screen, and then fades when the main application window appears.\n\n## To exclude the splash screen from build\n\n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, select the splash screen image.\n\n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the **Build Action** to **None**.\n\n## To remove the splash screen from an application\n\nIn **Solution Explorer**, delete the splash screen image.\n\n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.SplashScreen>\n- [How to: Add Existing Items to a Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/9f4t9t92(v=vs.100))\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,266],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application\"\nms.date: 08/18/2018\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"WPF [WPF], splash screen\"\n  - \"startup window [WPF]\"\n  - \"SplashScreen class [WPF]\"\n  - \"splash screen [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: d70a25c4-5fb9-4c27-b01d-b1b8ef39b3fd","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[273,321],"content":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","linkify":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[323,444],"content":"This topic shows how to add a startup window, or <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>splash screen<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, to a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application.","source":"This topic shows how to add a startup window, or *splash screen*, to a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application."},{"pos":[449,492],"content":"To add an existing image as a splash screen","linkify":"To add an existing image as a splash screen","nodes":[{"content":"To add an existing image as a splash screen","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"Create or find an image that you want to use for the splash screen.","pos":[498,565]},{"content":"You can use any image format that is supported by the Windows Imaging Component (WIC).","pos":[566,652]},{"content":"For example, you can use the BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF format.","pos":[653,718]},{"content":"Add the image file to the WPF Application project.","pos":[724,774]},{"pos":[780,823],"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, select the image.","source":"In **Solution Explorer**, select the image."},{"pos":[829,915],"content":"In the Properties window, click the drop-down arrow for the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Build Action<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property.","source":"In the Properties window, click the drop-down arrow for the **Build Action** property."},{"pos":[921,969],"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SplashScreen<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> from the drop-down list.","source":"Select **SplashScreen** from the drop-down list."},{"pos":[975,1021],"content":"Press <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>F5<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to build and run the application.","source":"Press **F5** to build and run the application."},{"content":"The splash screen image appears in the center of the screen, and then fades when the main application window appears.","pos":[1028,1145]},{"pos":[1150,1189],"content":"To exclude the splash screen from build","linkify":"To exclude the splash screen from build","nodes":[{"content":"To exclude the splash screen from build","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[1195,1252],"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, select the splash screen image.","source":"In **Solution Explorer**, select the splash screen image."},{"pos":[1258,1325],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window, set the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Build Action<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>None<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","source":"In the **Properties** window, set the **Build Action** to **None**."},{"pos":[1330,1377],"content":"To remove the splash screen from an application","linkify":"To remove the splash screen from an application","nodes":[{"content":"To remove the splash screen from an application","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[1379,1436],"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, delete the splash screen image.","source":"In **Solution Explorer**, delete the splash screen image."},{"pos":[1441,1449],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1490,1628],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Add Existing Items to a Project<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/9f4t9t92(v=vs.100))</ept>","source":"[How to: Add Existing Items to a Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/9f4t9t92(v=vs.100))"}]}
