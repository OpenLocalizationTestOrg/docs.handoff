The Visual Studio edition that you have and the settings that you use determine these elements. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To draw a line at design time  \n  \n1.  Drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.LineShape> control from the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab in the **Toolbox** drag to a form or container control.  \n  \n2.  Drag the sizing and move handles to size and position the line.  \n  \n     You can also size and position the line by changing the `X1`, `X2`, `Y1`, and `Y2` properties in the **Properties** window.  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, optionally set additional properties such as `BorderStyle` or `BorderColor` to change the appearance of the line.  \n  \n### To draw a line at run time  \n  \n1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add Reference**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Add Reference** dialog box, select **Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.VS**, and then click **OK**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Code Editor**, add an `Imports` or `using` statement at the top of the module:  \n  \n```vb  \nImports Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks;  \n```  \n  \n4.
