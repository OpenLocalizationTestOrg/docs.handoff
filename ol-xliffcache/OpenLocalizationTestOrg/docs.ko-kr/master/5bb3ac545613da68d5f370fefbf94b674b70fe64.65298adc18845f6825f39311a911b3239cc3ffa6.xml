Applications that use **WebRequest** and **WebResponse** can take advantage of new Internet protocols without needing extensive code changes.  \n  \n-   When writing ASP.NET applications that run on a server using the **System.Net** classes, it is often better, from a performance standpoint, to use the asynchronous methods for <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.GetResponse%2A> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse.GetResponseStream%2A>.  \n  \n-   The number of connections opened to an Internet resource can have a significant impact on network performance and throughput. **System.Net** uses two connections per application per host by default. Setting the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit%2A> property in the <xref:System.Net.ServicePoint> for your application can increase this number for a particular host. Setting the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager.DefaultPersistentConnectionLimit?displayProperty=nameWithType> property can increase this default for all hosts.  \n  \n-   When writing socket-level protocols, try to use <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient> or <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient> whenever possible instead of writing directly to a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket>. These two client classes encapsulate the creation of TCP and UDP sockets without requiring you to handle the details of the connection.  \n  \n-   When accessing sites that require credentials, use the <xref:System.Net.CredentialCache> class to create a cache of credentials rather than supplying them with every request. The **CredentialCache** class searches the cache to find the appropriate credential to present with a request, relieving you of the responsibility of creating and presenting credentials based on the URL.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Network Programming in the .NET
