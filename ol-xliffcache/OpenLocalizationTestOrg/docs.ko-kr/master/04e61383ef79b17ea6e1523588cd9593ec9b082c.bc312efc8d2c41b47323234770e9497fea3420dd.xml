The color matrix entries that represent translations are given in the following table.  \n  \n|Component to be translated|Matrix entry|  \n|--------------------------------|------------------|  \n|Red|[4][0]|  \n|Green|[4][1]|  \n|Blue|[4][2]|  \n|Alpha|[4][3]|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from the file ColorBars.bmp. Then the code adds 0.75 to the red component of each pixel in the image. The original image is drawn alongside the transformed image.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the original image on the left and the transformed image on the right:  \n  \n ![Screenshot of the original and transformed image.](./media/how-to-translate-image-colors/original-image-translate-colors.png)  \n  \n The following table lists the color vectors for the four bars before and after the red translation. Note that because the maximum value for a color component is 1, the red component in the second row does not change. (Similarly, the minimum value for a color component is 0.)  \n  \n|Original|Translated|  \n|--------------|----------------|  \n|Black (0, 0, 0, 1)|(0.75, 0, 0, 1)|  \n|Red (1, 0, 0, 1)|(1, 0, 0, 1)|  \n|Green (0, 1, 0, 1)|(0.75, 1, 0, 1)|  \n|Blue (0, 0, 1, 1)|(0.75, 0, 1, 1)|  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.RecoloringImages#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.RecoloringImages/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.RecoloringImages#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.RecoloringImages/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.
