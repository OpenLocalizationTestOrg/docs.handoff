The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component makes such a procedure possible.  \n  \n This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment. If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/adc0bc0a-a519-4812-bafc-fb9d1a5801fc).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are some limitations when using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component. For more information, see [Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md).  \n  \n### To run a procedure at set intervals with the Timer component  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> to your form. See the following Example section for an illustration of how to do this programmatically. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] also has support for adding components to a form. Also see [How to: Add Controls Without a User Interface to Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/becyw7bz\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property (in milliseconds) for the timer. This property determines how much time will pass before the procedure is run again.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The more often a timer event occurs, the more processor time is used in responding to the event. This can slow down overall performance. Do not set a smaller interval than you need.  \n  \n3.  Write appropriate code in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event handler. The code you write in this event will run at the interval specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property.  \n  \n4.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to `true` to start the timer. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event will begin to occur, running your procedure at the set interval.  \n  \n5.  At the appropriate time, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Enabled%2A> property to `false` to stop the procedure from running again. Setting the interval to `0` does not cause the timer to stop.  \n  \n## Example  \n This first code example tracks the time of day in one-second increments. It uses a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label>, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component on a form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property is set to 1000 (equal to one second). In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event, the label's caption is set to the current time. When the button is clicked, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Enabled%2A> property is set to `false`, stopping the timer from updating the label's caption. The following code example requires that you have a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control named`Button1`, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> control named`Timer1`, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control named`Label1`.  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate Sub InitializeTimer()  \n   ' Run this procedure in an appropriate event.  \n   ' Set to 1 second.  \n   Timer1.Interval = 1000  \n   ' Enable timer.  \n   Timer1.Enabled = True  \n   Button1.Text = \"Enabled\"  \nEnd Sub  \nx  \nPrivate Sub Timer1_Tick(ByVal Sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick  \n' Set the caption to the current time.  \n   Label1.Text = DateTime.Now  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nPrivate Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n      If Button1.Text = \"Stop\" Then  \n         Button1.Text = \"Start\"  \n         Timer1.Enabled = False  \n      Else  \n         Button1.Text = \"Stop\"  \n         Timer1.Enabled = True  \n      End If  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nprivate void InitializeTimer()  \n{  \n    // Call this procedure when the application starts.  \n    // Set to 1 second.  \n    Timer1.Interval = 1000;  \n    Timer1.Tick += new EventHandler(Timer1_Tick);  \n  \n    // Enable timer.  \n    Timer1.Enabled = true;  \n  \n    Button1.Text = \"Stop\";  \n    Button1.Click += new EventHandler(Button1_Click);  \n}  \n  \nprivate void Timer1_Tick(object Sender, EventArgs e)     \n{  \n   // Set the caption to the current time.  \n   Label1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString();  \n}  \n  \nprivate void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n  if ( Button1.Text == \"Stop\" )  \n  {  \n    Button1.Text = \"Start\";  \n    Timer1.Enabled = false;  \n  }  \n  else  \n  {  \n    Button1.Text = \"Stop\";  \n    Timer1.Enabled = true;  \n  }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n```cpp  \nprivate:  \n   void InitializeTimer()  \n   {  \n      // Run this procedure in an appropriate event.  \n      // Set to 1 second.  \n      timer1->Interval = 1000;  \n      // Enable timer.  \n      timer1->Enabled = true;  \n      this->timer1->Tick += gcnew System::EventHandler(this,    \n                               &Form1::timer1_Tick);  \n  \n      button1->Text = S\"Stop\";  \n      this->button1->Click += gcnew System::EventHandler(this,   \n                               &Form1::button1_Click);  \n   }  \n  \n   void timer1_Tick(System::Object ^ sender,  \n      System::EventArgs ^ e)  \n   {  \n      // Set the caption to the current time.  \n      label1->Text = DateTime::Now.ToString();  \n   }  \n  \n   void button1_Click(System::Object ^ sender,  \n      System::EventArgs ^ e)  \n   {  \n      if ( button1->Text == \"Stop\" )  \n      {  \n         button1->Text = \"Start\";  \n         timer1->Enabled = false;  \n      }  \n      else  \n      {  \n         button1->Text = \"Stop\";  \n         timer1->Enabled = true;  \n      }  \n   }  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n This second code example runs a procedure every 600 milliseconds until a loop has finished.
