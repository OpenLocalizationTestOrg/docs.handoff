With an access key, the user can \"click\" a button by pressing the ALT key in combination with the predefined access key. For example, if a button runs a procedure to print a form, and therefore its `Text` property is set to \"Print,\" adding an ampersand before the letter \"P\" causes the letter \"P\" to be underlined in the button text at run time. The user can run the command associated with the button by pressing ALT+P. You cannot have an access key for a control that cannot receive focus.  \n  \n### To create an access key for a control  \n  \n1.  Set the `Text` property to a string that includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the shortcut.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' Set the letter \"P\" as an access key.  \n    Button1.Text = \"&Print\"  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Set the letter \"P\" as an access key.  \n    button1.Text = \"&Print\";  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    // Set the letter \"P\" as an access key.  \n    button1->Text = \"&Print\";  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  To include an ampersand in a caption without creating an access key, include two ampersands (&&). A single ampersand is displayed in the caption and no characters are underlined.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>   \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)   \n [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)   \n [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,947],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,70],"content":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,70]}]}],"pos":[6,79],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], access keys\"\n  - \"Button control [Windows Forms], access keys\"\n  - \"dialog box controls, mnemonics\"\n  - \"access keys, creating for controls\"\n  - \"mnemonics, adding to dialog box controls\"\n  - \"mnemonics\"\n  - \"ampersand character in shortcut key\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, access keys\"\n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], controls\"\n  - \"Text property, specifying access keys for controls\"\n  - \"keyboard shortcuts, creating for controls\"\n  - \"access keys, Windows Forms\"\n  - \"ALT key\"\nms.assetid: 4faa0991-28ec-4eca-91db-51dc2cd6a7ac\ncaps.latest.revision: 13\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[954,1007],"content":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls","linkify":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>access key<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> is an underlined character in the text of a menu, menu item, or the label of a control such as a button.","pos":[1008,1128],"source":"An *access key* is an underlined character in the text of a menu, menu item, or the label of a control such as a button."},{"content":"With an access key, the user can \"click\" a button by pressing the ALT key in combination with the predefined access key.","pos":[1129,1249]},{"content":"For example, if a button runs a procedure to print a form, and therefore its <ph id=\"ph1\">`Text`</ph> property is set to \"Print,\" adding an ampersand before the letter \"P\" causes the letter \"P\" to be underlined in the button text at run time.","pos":[1250,1474],"source":" For example, if a button runs a procedure to print a form, and therefore its `Text` property is set to \"Print,\" adding an ampersand before the letter \"P\" causes the letter \"P\" to be underlined in the button text at run time."},{"content":"The user can run the command associated with the button by pressing ALT+P.","pos":[1475,1549]},{"content":"You cannot have an access key for a control that cannot receive focus.","pos":[1550,1620]},{"pos":[1630,1667],"content":"To create an access key for a control","linkify":"To create an access key for a control","nodes":[{"content":"To create an access key for a control","pos":[0,37]}]},{"pos":[1677,1788],"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Text`</ph> property to a string that includes an ampersand (&amp;) before the letter that will be the shortcut.","source":"Set the `Text` property to a string that includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the shortcut."},{"pos":[2116,2309],"content":"[!NOTE]\nTo include an ampersand in a caption without creating an access key, include two ampersands (&&).
