This property designates where your control resides in the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property can be set to the following values:  \n  \n|Setting|Effect on your control|  \n|-------------|----------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the bottom of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Fills all remaining space in the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the left side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the right side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the top of the form.|  \n  \n There is design-time support for this feature in Visual Studio.  \n  \n### To set the Dock property for your control at run time  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to the appropriate value in code.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' To set the Dock property internally.  \n    Me.Dock = DockStyle.Top  \n    ' To set the Dock property from another object.  \n    UserControl1.Dock = DockStyle.Top  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // To set the Dock property internally.  \n    this.Dock = DockStyle.Top;  \n    // To set the Dock property from another object.  \n    UserControl1.Dock = DockStyle.Top;  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName>
