However, the client library does not know to set message headers that are required in certain cases, such as when the data service requires claims-based authentication or cookies. For more information, see [Securing WCF Data Services](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/securing-wcf-data-services.md#clientAuthentication). In these cases, you must manually set message headers in the request message before it is sent. The example in this topic shows how to handle the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SendingRequest> event to add a new header to the request message before it is sent to the data service.  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md). You can also use the [Northwind sample data service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=187426) that is published on the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] Web site; this sample data service is read-only and attempting to save changes returns an error. The sample data services on the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] Web site allow anonymous authentication.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example registers a handler for the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SendingRequest> event and then executes a query against the data service.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When a data service requires you to manually set the message header for every request, consider registering the handler for the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SendingRequest> event by overriding the `OnContextCreated` partial method in the entity container that represents the data service, which in this case is `NorthwindEntities`.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind
