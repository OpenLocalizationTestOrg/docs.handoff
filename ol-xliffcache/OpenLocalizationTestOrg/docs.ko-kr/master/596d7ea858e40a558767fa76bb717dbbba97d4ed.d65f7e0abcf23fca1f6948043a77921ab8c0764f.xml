The following APIs are affected:\n\n- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer.WriteObject%2A> \n- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer.WriteObject%2A>\n- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer.WriteObject%2A>\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFor apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, this behavior is enabled by default.\n\nIf this behavior is not desirable, you can opt out of this feature by adding the following line to the `<runtime>` section of the app.config or web.config file:\n\n```xml\n<runtime>\n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Runtime.Serialization.DoNotUseECMAScriptV6EscapeControlCharacter=false\" />\n</runtime>\n```\n \n## See also\n[Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,112],"content":"Mitigation: Serialization of Control Characters with the DataContractJsonSerializer | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Serialization of Control Characters with the DataContractJsonSerializer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,100]}]},{"pos":[544,627],"content":"Mitigation: Serialization of Control Characters with the DataContractJsonSerializer","linkify":"Mitigation: Serialization of Control Characters with the DataContractJsonSerializer","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Serialization of Control Characters with the DataContractJsonSerializer","pos":[0,83]}]},{"content":"Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, the way in which control characters are serialized with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer&gt;</ph> has changed to conform to ECMAScript V6 and V8.","pos":[629,842],"source":"Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, the way in which control characters are serialized with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> has changed to conform to ECMAScript V6 and V8."},{"pos":[849,855],"content":"Impact","linkify":"Impact","nodes":[{"content":"Impact","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[857,1129],"content":"In the .NET framework 4.6.2 and earlier versions, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer&gt;</ph> did not serialize some special control characters, such as <ph id=\"ph2\">`\\b`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">`\\f`</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph4\">`\\t`</ph>, in a way that was compatible with the ECMAScript V6 and V8 standards.","source":"In the .NET framework 4.6.2 and earlier versions, the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> did not serialize some special control characters, such as `\\b`, `\\f`, and `\\t`, in a way that was compatible with the ECMAScript V6 and V8 standards."},{"content":"For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, serialization of these control characters is compatible with ECMAScript V6 and V8.","pos":[1131,1303]},{"content":"The following APIs are affected:","pos":[1304,1336]},{"pos":[1598,1608],"content":"Mitigation","linkify":"Mitigation","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"For apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, this behavior is enabled by default.","pos":[1610,1736]},{"pos":[1738,1898],"content":"If this behavior is not desirable, you can opt out of this feature by adding the following line to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`&lt;runtime&gt;`</ph> section of the app.config or web.config file:","source":"If this behavior is not desirable, you can opt out of this feature by adding the following line to the `<runtime>` section of the app.config or web.config file:"},{"pos":[2063,2071],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2072,2208],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)</ept>","source":"[Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)"}]}
