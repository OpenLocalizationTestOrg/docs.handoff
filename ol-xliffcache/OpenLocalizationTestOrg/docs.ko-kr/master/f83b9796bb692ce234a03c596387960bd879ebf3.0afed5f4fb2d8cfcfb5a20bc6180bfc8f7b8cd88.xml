For example, a breakpoint may be hit while stepping over a function, and the user may wish to start a new stepping operation inside that function. It is up to the debugger to determine how to handle this situation. The debugger may want to cancel the original stepping operation or nest the two operations. The `ICorDebugStepper` interface supports both choices.  \n  \n A stepper may migrate between threads if the common language runtime (CLR) makes a cross-threaded, marshaled call.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This interface does not support being called remotely, either cross-machine or cross-process.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
