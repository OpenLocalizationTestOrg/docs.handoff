If your application is required to persist workflow data to another medium, such as a different database or a file system, you can implement a custom instance store. A custom instance store is created by extending the abstract <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstanceStore> class and implementing the methods that are required for the implementation. For a complete implementation of a custom instance store, see the [Corporate Purchase Process](./samples/corporate-purchase-process.md) sample.\n\n## Implementing the BeginTryCommand method\n\nThe <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstanceStore.BeginTryCommand%2A> is sent to the instance store by the persistence engine. The type of the `command` parameter indicates which command is being executed; this parameter can be of the following types:\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SaveWorkflowCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store when a workflow is to be persisted to the storage medium. The workflow persistence data is provided to the method in the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SaveWorkflowCommand.InstanceData%2A> member of the `command` parameter.\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.LoadWorkflowCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store when a workflow is to be loaded from the storage medium. The instance ID of the workflow to be loaded is provided to the method in the `instanceId` parameter of the <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstancePersistenceContext.InstanceView%2A> property of the `context` parameter.\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.CreateWorkflowOwnerCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store when a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> must be registered as a lock owner. The instance ID of the current workflow should be provided to the instance store using <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstancePersistenceContext.BindInstanceOwner%2A> method of the `context` parameter.\n\n     The following code snippet demonstrates how to implement the CreateWorkflowOwner command to assign an explicit lock owner.\n\n    ```csharp\n    XName WFInstanceScopeName = XName.Get(scopeName, \"<namespace>\");\n    ...\n    CreateWorkflowOwnerCommand createCommand = new CreateWorkflowOwnerCommand()\n    {\n        InstanceOwnerMetadata =\n        {\n            { WorkflowHostTypeName, new InstanceValue(WFInstanceScopeName) },\n        }\n    };\n    InstanceHandle ownerHandle = store.CreateInstanceHandle();\n    store.DefaultInstanceOwner = store.Execute(\n                                   ownerHandle,\n                                   createCommand,\n                                   TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)).InstanceOwner;\n    childInstance.AddInitialInstanceValues(new Dictionary<XName, object>() { { WorkflowHostTypeName, WFInstanceScopeName } });\n    ```\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.DeleteWorkflowOwnerCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store when the instance ID of a lock owner can be removed from the instance store. As with <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.CreateWorkflowOwnerCommand>, the ID of the lock owner should be provided by the application.\n\n     The following code snippet demonstrates how to release a lock using <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.DeleteWorkflowOwnerCommand>.\n\n    ```csharp\n    static void FreeHandleAndDeleteOwner(InstanceStore store, InstanceHandle handle)\n    {\n        handle.Free();\n        handle = store.CreateInstanceHandle(store.DefaultInstanceOwner);\n        try\n        {\n            // We need this sleep so that we dont prematurely delete the owner, we need time to update the database.\n            Thread.Sleep(10000);\n            store.Execute(handle, new DeleteWorkflowOwnerCommand(), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10));\n        }\n        catch (InstancePersistenceCommandException ex) { Log.Inform(ex.Message); }\n        catch (InstanceOwnerException ex) { Log.Inform(ex.Message); }\n        catch (OperationCanceledException ex) { Log.Inform(ex.Message); }\n        catch (Exception ex) { Log.Inform(ex.Message); }\n        finally\n        {\n            handle.Free();\n            store.DefaultInstanceOwner = null;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n     The above method should be called in a Try/Catch block when a child instance is run.\n\n    ```csharp\n    try\n    {\n        childInstance.Run();\n    }\n    catch (Exception)\n    {\n        throw ;\n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        FreeHandleAndDeleteOwner(store, ownerHandle);\n    }\n    ```\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.LoadWorkflowByInstanceKeyCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store when a workflow instance is to be loaded using the workflowâ€™s instance key. The ID of the instance key can be determined by using the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.LoadWorkflowByInstanceKeyCommand.LookupInstanceKey%2A> parameter of the command.\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.QueryActivatableWorkflowsCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store to retrieve activation parameters for persisted workflows in order to create a workflow host that can then load workflows. This command is sent by the engine in response to the instance store raising the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.HasActivatableWorkflowEvent> to the host when it locates an instance that can be activated. The instance store should be polled to determine if there are workflows that can be activated.\n\n- <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.TryLoadRunnableWorkflowCommand>: The persistence engine sends this command to the instance store to load runnable workflow instances. This command is sent by the engine in response to the instance store raising the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.HasRunnableWorkflowEvent> to the host when it locates an instance that can be run. The instance store should poll for workflows that can be run. The following code snippet demonstrates polling an instance store for workflows that can be run or activated.\n\n    ```csharp\n    public void PollForEvents()\n    {\n        InstanceOwner[] storeOwners = this.GetInstanceOwners();\n\n        foreach (InstanceOwner owner in storeOwners)\n        {\n            foreach (InstancePersistenceEvent ppEvent in this.GetEvents(owner))\n            {\n                if (ppEvent.Equals(HasRunnableWorkflowEvent.Value))\n                {\n                    bool hasRunnable = GetRunnableEvents(this.StoreId, owner.InstanceOwnerId, isActivatable);\n                    if (hasRunnable)\n                    {\n                        this.SignalEvent(ppEvent, owner);\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        this.ResetEvent(ppEvent, owner);\n                    }\n                }\n                else if(ppEvent.Equals(HasActivatableWorkflowEvent.Value))\n                {\n                   bool hasActivatable = GetActivatableEvents(this.StoreId, owner.InstanceOwnerId);\n                   if (hasActivatable)\n                    {\n                        this.SignalEvent(ppEvent, owner);\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        this.ResetEvent(ppEvent, owner);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n     In the above code snippet, the instance store queries the events available and examines each one to determine if it is a <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.HasRunnableWorkflowEvent> event. If one is found, <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstanceStore.SignalEvent%2A> is called to signal the host to send a command to the instance store. The following code snippet demonstrates an implementation of a handler for this command.\n\n    ```csharp\n    If (command is TryLoadRunnableWorkflowCommand)\n    {\n        Owner owner;\n        CheckOwner(context, command.Name, out owner);\n        // Checking instance.Owner is like an InstanceLockQueryResult.\n        context.QueriedInstanceStore(new InstanceLockQueryResult(context.InstanceView.InstanceId, context.InstanceView.InstanceOwner.InstanceOwnerId));\n\n        XName ownerService = null;\n        InstanceValue value;\n        Instance runnableInstance = default(Instance);\n        bool foundRunnableInstance = false;\n\n        value = QueryPropertyBag(WorkflowNamespace.WorkflowHostType, owner.Data);\n        if (value != null && value.Value is XName)\n        {\n            ownerService = (XName)value.Value;\n        }\n\n        foreach (KeyValuePair<Guid, Instance> instance in MemoryStore.instances)\n        {\n            if (instance.Value.Owner != Guid.Empty || instance.Value.Completed)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            if (ownerService != null)\n            {\n                value = QueryPropertyBag(WorkflowNamespace.WorkflowHostType, instance.Value.Metadata);\n                if (value == null || ((XName)value.Value) != ownerService)\n                {\n                    continue;\n                }\n            }\n\n            value = QueryPropertyBag(WorkflowServiceNamespace.SuspendReason, instance.Value.Metadata);\n            if (value != null && value.Value != null && value.Value is string)\n            {\n                continue;\n            }\n\n            value = QueryPropertyBag(WorkflowNamespace.Status, instance.Value.Data);\n            if (value != null && value.Value is string && ((string)value.Value) == \"Executing\")\n            {\n                runnableInstance = instance.Value;\n                foundRunnableInstance = true;\n            }\n\n            if (!foundRunnableInstance)\n            {\n                value = QueryPropertyBag(XNamespace.Get(\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:System.Activities/4.0/properties\").GetName(\"TimerExpirationTime\"), instance.Value.Data);\n                if (value != null && value.Value is DateTime && ((DateTime)value.Value) <= DateTime.UtcNow)\n                {\n                    runnableInstance = instance.Value;\n                    foundRunnableInstance = true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (foundRunnableInstance)\n            {\n                runnableInstance.LockVersion++;\n                runnableInstance.Owner = context.InstanceView.InstanceOwner.InstanceOwnerId;\n                MemoryStore.instances[instance.Key] = runnableInstance;\n                context.BindInstance(instance.Key);\n                context.BindAcquiredLock(runnableInstance.LockVersion);\n\n                Dictionary<Guid, IDictionary<XName, InstanceValue>> associatedKeys = new Dictionary<Guid, IDictionary<XName, InstanceValue>>();\n                Dictionary<Guid, IDictionary<XName, InstanceValue>> completedKeys = new Dictionary<Guid, IDictionary<XName, InstanceValue>>();\n                foreach (KeyValuePair<Guid, Key> keyEntry in MemoryStore.keys)\n                {\n                if (keyEntry.Value.Instance == context.InstanceView.InstanceId)\n                {\n                    if (keyEntry.Value.Completed)\n                    {\n                        completedKeys.Add(keyEntry.Key, DeserializePropertyBag(keyEntry.Value.Metadata));\n                    }\n                    else\n                    {\n                        associatedKeys.Add(keyEntry.Key, DeserializePropertyBag(keyEntry.Value.Metadata));\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            context.LoadedInstance(InstanceState.Initialized, DeserializePropertyBag(runnableInstance.Data), DeserializePropertyBag(runnableInstance.Metadata), associatedKeys, completedKeys);\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In the above code snippet, the instance store searches for runnable instances. If an instance is found, it is bound to the execution context and loaded.\n\n## Using a custom instance store\n\nTo implement a custom instance store, assign an instance of the instance store to the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.InstanceStore%2A>, and implement the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.PersistableIdle%2A> method. See the [How to: Create and Run a Long Running Workflow](how-to-create-and-run-a-long-running-workflow.md) tutorial for specifics.\n\n## A sample instance store\n\nThe following code sample is a complete instance store implementation, taken from the [Corporate Purchase Process](./samples/corporate-purchase-process.md) sample. This instance store persists workflow data to a file using XML.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Activities.DurableInstancing;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing
