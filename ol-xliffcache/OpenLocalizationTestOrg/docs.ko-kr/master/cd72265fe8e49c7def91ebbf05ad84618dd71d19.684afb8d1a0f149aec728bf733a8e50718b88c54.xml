If you have a substantial investment in component-based application logic hosted in COM+, you can use WCF to extend your existing logic rather than having to rewrite it. The topics within this section describe how to use COM+ with WCF.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Integrating with COM+ Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications-overview.md)  \n Gives an overview of when and how to integrate COM+ components.  \n  \n [How to: Use the COM+ Service Model Configuration Tool](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-the-com-service-model-configuration-tool.md)  \n Explains how to use the COM+ Service Model Configuration command-line tool (ComSvcConfig.exe) to configure the application interfaces that you want exposed as WCF services.  \n  \n [How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-com-service-settings.md)  \n Explains how to configure a COM+ object as a WCF service.  \n  \n [How to: Deploy a COM+ Integration Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-deploy-a-com-integration-application.md)  \n Explains how to move a COM+ integration application.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Integrating with COM Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-applications.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,382],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Integrating with COM+ Applications\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
