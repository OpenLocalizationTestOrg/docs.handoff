You can alternatively specify the image by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.ImageLocation%2A> property and then load the image synchronously using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.Load%2A> method or asynchronously using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.LoadAsync%2A> method. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.SizeMode%2A> property controls how the image and control fit with each other.
