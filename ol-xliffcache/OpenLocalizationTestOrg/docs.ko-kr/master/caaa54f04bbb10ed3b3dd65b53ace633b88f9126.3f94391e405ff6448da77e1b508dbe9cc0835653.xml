This assertion is used with the Message Framing protocol provided for transports such as TCP, and named pipes.|  \n|msf:SslTransportSecurity|Endpoint|Endpoint uses transport-layer security (TLS) with message framing.|  \n|msf:WindowsTransportSecurity|Endpoint|Endpoint uses Security Provider Negotiation (SPNEGO) with message framing.|  \n|msmq:MsmqBestEffort|Endpoint|MSMQ with best-effort guarantees.|  \n|msmq:MsmqSession|Endpoint|MSMQ with Session guarantees.|  \n|msmq:MsmqVolatile|Endpoint|MSMQ Volatile.|  \n|msmq:Authenticated|Endpoint|Authentication is used with MSMQ transport.|  \n|msmq:WindowsDomain|Endpoint|MSMQ uses Windows Domain authentication.|  \n|cdp:CompositeDuplex|Endpoint|Endpoint uses two separate converse transport connections for in and out messages.|  \n|mssp:RsaToken|Nested|RSA key token assertion. This requirement is typically satisfied by an RSA key serialized directly as part of the key information in an endorsing signature.|  \n|mssp:SslContextToken|Nested|Requires that a SecurityContextToken obtained using binary TLS handshake using WS-Trust be used. Nested assertions include: sp:RequireDerivedKeys, mssp:MustNotSendCancel, mssp:RequireClientCertificate.|  \n|mssp:MustNotSendCancel|Nested|Specifies a requirement that a request security token (RST) request messages [WS-Trust] using the Cancel binding [WS-Trust, WS-SC] not be sent to the issuer of a given SecurityContextToken. If this assertion is present, then such request messages must not be sent to the issuer. If this assertion is not present, then such request messages can be sent to the issuer.|  \n|mssp:RequireClientCertificate|Nested|This optional element specifies a requirement for a client certificate to be provided as part of the TLSNEGO protocol. If this assertion is present, then a client certificate must be provided. If this assertion is not present, then a client certificate must not be provided. This assertion must not be used outside of mssp:SslContextToken.|  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Custom WSDL Publication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-wsdl-publication.md)\n- [How to:
