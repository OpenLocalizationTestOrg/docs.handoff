The application will be composed of several              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] pages that are hosted in a browser-style window.  \n  \n The sample code that is used to build this walkthrough is available for both              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualb](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualb-md.md)] and              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_cshrp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-cshrp-md.md)] at              [Introduction to Building WPF Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160008).  \n  \n<a name=\"Requirements\"></a>   \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)]  \n  \n For more information about installing                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)], see                  [Installing Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/da049020-cfda-40d7-8ff4-7492772b620f).  \n  \n<a name=\"Create_The_Application_Code_Files\"></a>   \n## Creating the Application Project  \n In this section, you create the application infrastructure, which includes an application definition, two pages, and an image.  \n  \n1.  Create a new WPF Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named                          `ExpenseIt`. For more information, see                          [How to: Create a New WPF Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1f6aea7a-33e1-4d3f-8555-1daa42e95d82).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This                              walkthrough uses the                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid> control that is available in the .NET Framework 4. Be sure that your project targets the .NET Framework 4. For more information, see                              [How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dea62d25-3d1b-492e-a6cc-b5154489800a).  \n  \n2.  Open Application.xaml (Visual Basic) or App.xaml (C#).  \n  \n     This                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] file defines a                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application and any application resources. You also use this file to specify the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] that automatically shows when the application starts; in this case, MainWindow.xaml.  \n  \n     Your                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] should look like this in Visual Basic:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#1_A](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/VB/ExpenseIt1_A/Application.xaml#1_a)]  \n  \n     Or like this in C#:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/CSharp/ExpenseIt/App.xaml#1)]  \n  \n3.  Open MainWindow.xaml.  \n  \n     This                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] file is the main window of your application and displays content created in pages. The                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> class defines the properties of a window, such as its title, size, or icon, and handles events, such as closing or hiding.  \n  \n4.  Change the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> element to a                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  \n  \n     This application will navigate to different content depending on the user interaction. Therefore, the main                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> needs to be changed to a                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> inherits all the properties of                          <xref:System.Windows.Window>. The                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> element in the XAML file creates an instance of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> class. For more information, see                          [Navigation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/navigation-overview.md).  \n  \n5.  Change the following properties on the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> element:  \n  \n    -   Set the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window.Title%2A> property to \"ExpenseIt\".  \n  \n    -   Set the                                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> property to 500 pixels.  \n  \n    -   Set the                                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> property to 350 pixels.  \n  \n    -   Remove the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements between the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> tags.  \n  \n     Your                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] should look like this in Visual Basic:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#2_A](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/VB/ExpenseIt/MainWindow.xaml#2_a)]  \n  \n     Or like this in C#:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/CSharp/ExpenseIt/MainWindow.xaml#2)]  \n  \n6.  Open MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs.  \n  \n     This file is a code-behind file that contains code to handle the events declared in MainWindow.xaml. This file contains a partial class for the window defined in XAML.  \n  \n7.  If you are using C#, change the                          `MainWindow` class to derive from                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>.  \n  \n     In Visual Basic, this happens automatically when you change the window in XAML.  \n  \n     Your code should look like this.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[ExpenseIt#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/CSharp/ExpenseIt/MainWindow.xaml.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[ExpenseIt#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/VB/ExpenseIt1_A/MainWindow.xaml.vb#3)]  \n  \n<a name=\"add_files_to_the_application\"></a>   \n## Adding Files to the Application  \n In this section, you add two pages and an image to the application.  \n  \n1.  Add a new Page (WPF) to the project named                          `ExpenseItHome.xaml`. For more information, see                          [How to: Add New Items to a WPF Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/17e6b238-fc32-4385-98ef-2f66ca09d9ad).  \n  \n     This page is the first page that is displayed when the application is launched. It will show a list of people from which a user can select a person to show an expense report for.  \n  \n2.  Open ExpenseItHome.xaml.  \n  \n3.  Set the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.Title%2A> to \"ExpenseIt - Home\".  \n  \n     Your                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] should look like this in Visual Basic:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#6_A](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/VB/ExpenseIt1_A/ExpenseItHome.xaml#6_a)]  \n  \n     Or this in C#:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/CSharp/ExpenseIt2/ExpenseItHome.xaml#6)]  \n  \n4.  Open MainWindow.xaml.  \n  \n5.  Set the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Source%2A> property on the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> to \"ExpenseItHome.xaml\".  \n  \n     This sets ExpenseItHome.xaml to be the first page opened when the application starts. Your                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] should look like this in Visual Basic:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#7_A](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/VB/ExpenseIt1_A/MainWindow.xaml#7_a)]  \n  \n     Or this in C#:  \n  \n     [!code-xml[ExpenseIt#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ExpenseIt/CSharp/ExpenseIt2/MainWindow.xaml#7)]  \n  \n6.  Add a new Page (WPF) to the project named                          `ExpenseReportPage.xaml`.  \n  \n     This page will show the expense report for the person that is selected on ExpenseItHome.xaml.  \n  \n7.  Open ExpenseReportPage.xaml.  \n  \n8.

You typically create a layout with one of the following layout controls:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>  \n  \n Each of these layout controls supports a special type of layout for its child elements. ExpenseIt pages can be resized, and each page has elements that are arranged horizontally and vertically alongside other elements. Consequently, the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is the ideal layout element for the application.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more information about                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements, see                      [Panels Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md). For more information about layout, see                      [Layout](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md).  \n  \n In the section, you create a single-column table with three rows and a 10-pixel margin by adding column and row definitions to the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> in ExpenseItHome.xaml.  \n  \n1.
