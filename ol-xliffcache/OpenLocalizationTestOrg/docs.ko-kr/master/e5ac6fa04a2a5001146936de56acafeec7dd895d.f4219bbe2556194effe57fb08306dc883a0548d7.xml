Learn how to create projects, unit tests, use the debugging tools, and incorporate third-party libraries via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This article uses [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) on macOS.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nInstall the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). The .NET Core SDK includes the latest release of the .NET Core framework and runtime.\n\nInstall [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). During the course of this article, you also install Visual Studio Code extensions that improve the .NET Core development experience.\n\nInstall the Visual Studio Code C# extension by opening Visual Studio Code and pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the Visual Studio Code palette. Type **ext install** to see the list of extensions. Select the C# extension. Restart Visual Studio Code to activate the extension. For more information, see the [Visual Studio Code C# Extension documentation](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/blob/master/debugger.md).\n\n## Get started\n\nIn this tutorial, you create three projects: a library project, tests for that library project, and a console application that makes use of the library. You can [view or download the source](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/getting-started/golden) for this topic at the dotnet/samples repository on GitHub. For download instructions, see [Samples and Tutorials](../../samples-and-tutorials/index.md#viewing-and-downloading-samples).\n\nStart Visual Studio Code. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\\`</kbd> (the backquote or backtick character) or select **View > Integrated Terminal** from the menu to open an embedded terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can still open an external shell with the Explorer **Open in Command Prompt** command (**Open in Terminal** on Mac or Linux) if you prefer to work outside of Visual Studio Code.\n\nBegin by creating a solution file, which serves as a container for one or more .NET Core projects. In the terminal, create a *golden* folder and open the folder. This folder is the root of your solution. Run the [`dotnet new`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) command to create a new solution, *golden.sln*:\n\n```console\ndotnet new sln\n```\n\nFrom the *golden* folder, execute the following command to create a library project, which produces two files,*library.csproj* and *Class1.cs*, in the *library* folder:\n\n```console\ndotnet new classlib -o library\n```\n\nExecute the [`dotnet sln`](../tools/dotnet-sln.md) command to add the newly created *library.csproj* project to the solution:\n\n```console\ndotnet sln add library/library.csproj\n```\n\nThe *library.csproj* file contains the following information:\n\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard1.4</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n</Project>\n```\n\nOur library methods serialize and deserialize objects in JSON format. To support JSON serialization and deserialization, add a reference to the `Newtonsoft.Json` NuGet package. The `dotnet add` command adds new items to a project. To add a reference to a NuGet package, use the [`dotnet add package`](../tools/dotnet-add-package.md) command and specify the name of the package:\n\n```console\ndotnet add library package Newtonsoft.Json\n```\n\nThis adds `Newtonsoft.Json` and its dependencies to the library project. Alternatively, manually edit the *library.csproj* file and add the following node:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"10.0.1\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nExecute [`dotnet restore`](../tools/dotnet-restore.md), ([see note](#dotnet-restore-note)) which restores dependencies and creates an *obj* folder inside *library* with three files in it, including a *project.assets.json* file:\n\n```console\ndotnet restore\n```\n\nIn the *library* folder, rename the file *Class1.cs* to *Thing.cs*. Replace the code with the following:\n\n```csharp\nusing static Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert;\n\nnamespace Library\n{\n    public class Thing\n    {\n        public int Get(int left, int right) =>\n            DeserializeObject<int>($\"{left + right}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `Thing` class contains one public method, `Get`, which returns the sum of two numbers but does so by converting the sum into a string and then deserializing it into an integer. This makes use of a number of modern C# features, such as [`using static` directives](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-static.md), [expression-bodied members](../../csharp/whats-new/csharp-7.md#more-expression-bodied-members), and [string interpolation](../../csharp/language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md).\n\nBuild the library with the [`dotnet build`](../tools/dotnet-build.md) command. This produces a *library.dll* file under *golden/library/bin/Debug/netstandard1.4*:\n\n```console\ndotnet build\n```\n\n## Create the test project\n\nBuild a test project for the library. From the *golden* folder, create a new test project:\n\n```console\ndotnet new xunit -o test-library\n```\n\nAdd the test project to the solution:\n\n```console\ndotnet sln add test-library/test-library.csproj\n```\n\nAdd a project reference the library you created in the previous section so that the compiler can find and use the library project. Use the [`dotnet add reference`](../tools/dotnet-add-reference.md) command:\n\n```console\ndotnet add test-library/test-library.csproj reference library/library.csproj\n```\n\nAlternatively, manually edit the *test-library.csproj* file and add the following node:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\library\\library.csproj\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nNow that the dependencies have been properly configured, create the tests for your library. Open *UnitTest1.cs* and replace its contents with the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing Library;\nusing Xunit;\n\nnamespace TestApp\n{\n    public class LibraryTests\n    {\n        [Fact]\n        public void TestThing() {\n            Assert.NotEqual(42, new Thing().Get(19, 23));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that you assert the value 42 is not equal to 19+23 (or 42) when you first create the unit test (`Assert.NotEqual`), which will fail. An important step in building unit tests is to create the test to fail once first to confirm its logic.\n\nFrom the *golden* folder, execute the following commands:\n\n```console\ndotnet restore \ndotnet test test-library/test-library.csproj\n```\n\nThese commands will recursively find all projects to restore dependencies, build them, and activate the xUnit test runner to run the tests. The single test fails, as you expect.\n\nEdit the *UnitTest1.cs* file and change the assertion from `Assert.NotEqual` to `Assert.Equal`. Execute the following command from the *golden* folder to re-run the test, which passes this time:\n\n```console\ndotnet test test-library/test-library.csproj\n```\n\n## Create the console app\n\nThe console app you create over the following steps takes a dependency on the library project you created earlier and calls its library method when it runs. Using this pattern of development, you see how to create reusable libraries for multiple projects.\n\nCreate a new console application from the *golden* folder:\n\n```console\ndotnet new console -o app\n```\n\nAdd the console app project to the solution:\n\n```console\ndotnet sln add app/app.csproj\n```\n\nCreate the dependency on the library by running the `dotnet add reference` command:\n\n```console\ndotnet add app/app.csproj reference library/library.csproj\n```\n\nRun `dotnet restore` ([see note](#dotnet-restore-note)) to restore the dependencies of the three projects in the solution. Open *Program.cs* and replace the contents of the `Main` method with the following line:\n\n```csharp\nWriteLine($\"The answer is {new Thing().Get(19, 23)}\");\n```\n\nAdd two `using` directives to the top of the *Program.cs* file:\n\n```csharp\nusing static System.Console;\nusing Library;\n```\n\nExecute the following `dotnet run` command to run the executable, where the `-p` option to `dotnet run` specifies the project for the main application. The app produces the string \"The answer is 42\".\n\n```console\ndotnet run -p app/app.csproj\n```\n\n## Debug the application\n\nSet a breakpoint at the `WriteLine` statement in the `Main` method. Do this by either pressing the <kbd>F9</kbd> key when the cursor is over the `WriteLine` line or by clicking the mouse in the left margin on the line where you want to set the breakpoint. A red circle will appear in the margin next to the line of code. When the breakpoint is reached, code execution will stop *before* the breakpoint line is executed.\n\nOpen the debugger tab by selecting the Debug icon in the Visual Studio Code toolbar, selecting **View > Debug** from the menu bar, or using the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>:\n\n![Visual Studio Code Debugger](./media/using-on-macos/visual-studio-code-debugger.png)\n\nPress the Play button to start the application under the debugger. The app begins execution and runs to the breakpoint, where it stops. Step into the `Get` method and make sure that you have passed in the correct arguments. Confirm that the answer is 42.\n\n<a name=\"dotnet-restore-note\"></a>\n[!INCLUDE[DotNet Restore
