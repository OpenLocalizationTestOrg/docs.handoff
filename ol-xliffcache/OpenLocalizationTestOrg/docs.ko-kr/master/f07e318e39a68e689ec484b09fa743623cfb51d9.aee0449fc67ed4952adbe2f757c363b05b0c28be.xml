They can be found under the `ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor. The instances are named using this pattern:  \n  \n```  \n(ServiceName).(ContractName)@(endpoint listener address)  \n```  \n  \n The data is similar to that collected for individual operations, but is only aggregated across the endpoint.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, WCF replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Performance Counters](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/performance-counters/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,113],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Endpoint Performance Counters\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 7d44d576-bd4e-453b-8b76-a818ce90b806","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[120,149],"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","linkify":"Endpoint Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Endpoint performance counters capture data that reveals how an endpoint is accepting messages.","pos":[150,244]},{"content":"They can be found under the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0`</ph> performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor.","pos":[245,365],"source":" They can be found under the `ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor."},{"content":"The instances are named using this pattern:","pos":[366,409]},{"content":"The data is similar to that collected for individual operations, but is only aggregated across the endpoint.","pos":[490,598]},{"pos":[606,851],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name.
