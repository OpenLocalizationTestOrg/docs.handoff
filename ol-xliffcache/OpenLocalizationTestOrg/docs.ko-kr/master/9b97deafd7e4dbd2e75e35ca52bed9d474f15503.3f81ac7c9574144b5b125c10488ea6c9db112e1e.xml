[!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] exposes data as resources that are addressable by URIs. Data is accessed and changed by using standard HTTP verbs of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] uses the entity-relationship conventions of the [Entity Data Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model.md) to expose resources as sets of entities that are related by associations.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] uses the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] protocol for addressing and updating resources. In this way, you can access these services from any client that supports [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] enables you to request and write data to resources by using well-known transfer formats: Atom, a set of standards for exchanging and updating data as XML, and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a text-based data exchange format used extensively in AJAX application.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] can expose data that originates from various sources as [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feeds. Visual Studio tools make it easier for you to create an [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)]-based service by using an ADO.NET Entity Framework data model. You can also create [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feeds based on common language runtime (CLR) classes and even late-bound or un-typed data.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] also includes a set of client libraries, one for general .NET Framework client applications and another specifically for Silverlight-based applications. These client libraries provide an object-based programming model when you access an [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed from environments such as the .NET Framework and Silverlight.  \n  \n## Where Should I Start?  \n Depending on your interests, consider getting started with [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] in one of the following
