It compares the pointer values of reference types and is meaningless with value types.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31419  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you intend to compare the values of two value types, use the `=` or `<>` comparison operator.  \n  \n-   If you intend to compare the pointers of two reference types, be sure you are using object references for both operands. You can use reference variables or elements, such as the [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me) keyword, that behave like reference variables.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Comparison Operators in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/comparison-operators.md)\n- [How to: Test Whether Two Objects Are the Same](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/how-to-test-whether-two-objects-are-the-same.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,263],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '<typename>'.\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31419\"\n  - \"vbc31419\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31419\"\nms.assetid: c44d2936-8c07-443a-b320-ac2bfbc1e9ec","nodes":[{"content":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '<typename>'.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,102],"content":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;typename&gt;</ph>'.","source":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '<typename>'."}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[270,373],"content":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '\\<typename>'.","linkify":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '\\<typename>'.","nodes":[{"content":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>typename&gt;'.","pos":[0,103],"source":"'IsNot' requires operands that have reference types, but this operand has the value type '\\<typename>'."}]},{"pos":[374,518],"content":"An expression uses the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>IsNot Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md)</ept> with at least one value type operand.","source":"An expression uses the [IsNot Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md) with at least one value type operand."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`IsNot`</ph> operator determines whether two object references refer to different objects.","pos":[525,614],"source":"The `IsNot` operator determines whether two object references refer to different objects."},{"content":"It compares the pointer values of reference types and is meaningless with value types.","pos":[615,701]},{"pos":[708,729],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31419","source":"**Error ID:** BC31419"},{"pos":[738,759],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[769,865],"content":"If you intend to compare the values of two value types, use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`=`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`&lt;&gt;`</ph> comparison operator.","source":"If you intend to compare the values of two value types, use the `=` or `<>` comparison operator."},{"content":"If you intend to compare the pointers of two reference types, be sure you are using object references for both operands.","pos":[875,995]},{"content":"You can use reference variables or elements, such as the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)</ept> keyword, that behave like reference variables.","pos":[996,1192],"source":" You can use reference variables or elements, such as the [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me) keyword, that behave like reference variables."},{"pos":[1201,1209],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1213,1357],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Comparison Operators in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/comparison-operators.md)</ept>","source":"[Comparison Operators in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/comparison-operators.md)"},{"pos":[1360,1537],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Test Whether Two Objects Are the Same<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/how-to-test-whether-two-objects-are-the-same.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Test Whether Two Objects Are the Same](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/how-to-test-whether-two-objects-are-the-same.md)"}]}
