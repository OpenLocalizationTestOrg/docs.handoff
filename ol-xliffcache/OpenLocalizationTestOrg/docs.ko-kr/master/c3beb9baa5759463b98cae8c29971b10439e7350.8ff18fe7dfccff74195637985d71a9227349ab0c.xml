This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to pass a string as an argument to a custom [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] activity.  \n  \n## To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the SimpleInterop.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
