No certificate was found in the request.  \n  \n## Description  \n This trace indicates that the HTTPS listener received an HTTPS request that was not associated with a client certificate. Since the listener was configured to require client certificates on all HTTPS requests, the listener failed to validate the client’s authenticity.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,90],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,78]}]},{"pos":[388,449],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsClientCertificateNotPresent","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"Client certificate is required.","pos":[450,481]},{"content":"No certificate was found in the request.","pos":[482,522]},{"pos":[531,542],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This trace indicates that the HTTPS listener received an HTTPS request that was not associated with a client certificate.","pos":[546,667]},{"content":"Since the listener was configured to require client certificates on all HTTPS requests, the listener failed to validate the client’s authenticity.","pos":[668,814]},{"pos":[823,831],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[835,909],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[912,1067],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1070,1159],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
