When you use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind your data source to a Windows Forms control, you can notify the control that your data source has changed by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method to notify a bound control about an update in the data source.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/CPP/form1.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
