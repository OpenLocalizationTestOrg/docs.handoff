Specifying `/verbose` is the same as specifying `/verbose+`, which causes the compiler to emit verbose messages. The default for this option is `/verbose-`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `/verbose` option displays information about the total number of errors issued by the compiler, reports which assemblies are being loaded by a module, and displays which files are currently being compiled.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/verbose` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `In.vb` and directs the compiler to display verbose status information.  \n  \n```  \nvbc /verbose in.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,37],"content":"/verbose | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"/verbose | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[656,664],"content":"/verbose","linkify":"/verbose","nodes":[{"content":"/verbose","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Causes the compiler to produce verbose status and error messages.","pos":[665,730]},{"pos":[739,745],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[787,796],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> &amp;#124; <ph id=\"ph2\">`-`</ph>","pos":[800,814],"source":"`+` &#124; `-`"},{"content":"Optional.","pos":[818,827]},{"content":"Specifying <ph id=\"ph1\">`/verbose`</ph> is the same as specifying <ph id=\"ph2\">`/verbose+`</ph>, which causes the compiler to emit verbose messages.","pos":[828,940],"source":" Specifying `/verbose` is the same as specifying `/verbose+`, which causes the compiler to emit verbose messages."},{"content":"The default for this option is <ph id=\"ph1\">`/verbose-`</ph>.","pos":[941,984],"source":" The default for this option is `/verbose-`."},{"pos":[993,1000],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1004,1213],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`/verbose`</ph> option displays information about the total number of errors issued by the compiler, reports which assemblies are being loaded by a module, and displays which files are currently being compiled.","source":"The `/verbose` option displays information about the total number of errors issued by the compiler, reports which assemblies are being loaded by a module, and displays which files are currently being compiled."},{"pos":[1221,1384],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `/verbose` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`/verbose`</ph> option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.","pos":[9,161],"source":" The `/verbose` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line."}]},{"pos":[1393,1400],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1404,1503],"content":"The following code compiles <ph id=\"ph1\">`In.vb`</ph> and directs the compiler to display verbose status information.","source":"The following code compiles `In.vb` and directs the compiler to display verbose status information."},{"pos":[1548,1556],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1560,1661],"source":"[Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Sample Compilation Command Lines<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)</ept>","pos":[1664,1790],"source":" [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)"}]}
