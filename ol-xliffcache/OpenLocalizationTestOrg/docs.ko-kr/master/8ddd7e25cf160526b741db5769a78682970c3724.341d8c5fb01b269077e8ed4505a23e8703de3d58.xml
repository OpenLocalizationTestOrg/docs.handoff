If you try to populate an XML tree with a very large XML file, your memory usage will be proportional to the size of the file (that is, excessive). Therefore, you should use a streaming technique instead.  \n  \n Streaming techniques are best applied in situations where you need to process the source document only once, and you can process the elements in document order. Certain standard query operators, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderBy%2A>, iterate their source, collect all of the data, sort it, and then finally yield the first item in the sequence. Note that if you use a query operator that materializes its source before yielding the first item, you will not retain a small memory footprint for your application.  \n  \n Even if you use the technique described in [How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information.md), if you try to assemble an XML tree that contains the transformed document, memory usage will be too great.  \n  \n There are two main approaches. One approach is to use the deferred processing characteristics of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement>. Another approach is to create an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and use the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] to write elements to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>. This topic demonstrates both approaches.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example builds on the example in [How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information.md).  \n  \n This example uses the deferred execution capabilities of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement> to stream the output. This example can transform a very large document while maintaining a small memory footprint.  \n  \n Note that the custom axis (`StreamCustomerItem`) is specifically written so that it expects a document that has `Customer`, `Name`, and `Item` elements, and that those elements will be arranged as in the following Source.xml document. A more robust implementation, however, would be prepared to parse an invalid document.  \n  \n The following is the source document, Source.xml:  \n  \n```xml  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>   \n<Root>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>A. Datum Corporation</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0001</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0002</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0003</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0004</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>Fabrikam, Inc.</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0005</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0006</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0007</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0008</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>Southridge Video</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0009</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0010</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n</Root>  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic IEnumerable<XElement> StreamCustomerItem(string uri)  \n{  \n    using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(uri))  \n    {  \n        XElement name = null;  \n        XElement item = null;  \n  \n        reader.MoveToContent();  \n  \n        // Parse the file, save header information when encountered, and yield the  \n        // Item XElement objects as they are created.  \n  \n        // loop through Customer elements  \n        while (reader.Read())  \n        {  \n            if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element  \n                && reader.Name == \"Customer\")  \n            {  \n                // move to Name element  \n                while (reader.Read())  \n                {  \n                    if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element &&  \n                        reader.Name == \"Name\")  \n                    {  \n                        name = XElement.ReadFrom(reader) as XElement;  \n                        break;  \n                    }  \n                }  \n  \n                // loop through Item elements  \n                while (reader.Read())  \n                {  \n                    if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.EndElement)  \n                        break;  \n                    if (reader.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Element  \n                        && reader.Name == \"Item\")  \n                    {  \n                        item = XElement.ReadFrom(reader) as XElement;  \n                        if (item != null)  \n                        {  \n                            XElement tempRoot = new XElement(\"Root\",  \n                                new XElement(name)  \n                            );  \n                            tempRoot.Add(item);  \n                            yield return item;  \n                        }  \n                    }  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nstatic void Main(string[] args)  \n{  \n    XStreamingElement root = new XStreamingElement(\"Root\",  \n        from el in StreamCustomerItem(\"Source.xml\")  \n        select new XElement(\"Item\",  \n            new XElement(\"Customer\", (string)el.Parent.Element(\"Name\")),  \n            new XElement(el.Element(\"Key\"))  \n        )  \n    );  \n    root.Save(\"Test.xml\");  \n    Console.WriteLine(File.ReadAllText(\"Test.xml\"));  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>  \n<Root>  \n  <Item>  \n    <Customer>A.
