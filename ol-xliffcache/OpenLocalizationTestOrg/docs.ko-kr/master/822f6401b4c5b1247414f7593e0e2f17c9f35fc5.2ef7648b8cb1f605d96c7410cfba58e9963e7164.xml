If you need more control, however, you can create a custom binding with a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>, as explained in these topics. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md)  \n Describes the authentication modes that are possible with a custom binding.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Custom Binding Using the SecurityBindingElement](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-custom-binding-using-the-securitybindingelement.md)  \n Describes the basic steps for creating a custom binding with a security element.  \n  \n [How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-securitybindingelement-for-a-specified-authentication-mode.md)  \n Describes how to create a security element for a specified authentication mode.  \n  \n [How to: Disable Secure Sessions on a WSFederationHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-disable-secure-sessions-on-a-wsfederationhttpbinding.md)  \n Describes how to disable secure sessions when creating a federation service.  \n  \n [How to: Enable Message Replay Detection](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-enable-message-replay-detection.md)  \n Describes how to determine when a replay attack occurs.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Supporting Credential](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-supporting-credential.md)  \n Describes how to supply a supporting credential to a service, if the service requires it.  \n  \n [How to: Set Up a Signature Confirmation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-set-up-a-signature-confirmation.md)  \n Describes the steps to confirm signatures when digitally signing messages.  \n  \n [How to: Set a Max Clock Skew](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-set-a-max-clock-skew.md)  \n Describes how to set the maximum allowed time difference between a service and a client.  \n  \n [How to: Disable Encryption of Digital Signatures](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-disable-encryption-of-digital-signatures.md)  \n Describes how disabling encryption of digital signatures can have a performance benefit.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>  \n  \n
