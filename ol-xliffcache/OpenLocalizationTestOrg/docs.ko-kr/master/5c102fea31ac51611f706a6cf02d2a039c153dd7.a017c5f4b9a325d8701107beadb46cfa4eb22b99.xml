Bindings consist of elements that define how the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] channels are layered up to provide the required communication features. A binding contains three types of elements:  \n  \n-   Protocol channel binding elements, which determine the security, reliability, context flow settings, or user-defined protocols to use with messages that are sent to the endpoint.  \n  \n-   Transport channel binding elements, which determine the underlying transport protocol to use when sending messages to the endpoint, for example, TCP or HTTP.  \n  \n-   Message encoding binding elements, which determine the wire encoding to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint, for example, text/XML, binary, or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).  \n  \n This topic presents all of the system-provided [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] bindings. If none of these meets the exact requirements for your application, you can create a binding using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding> class. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] creating custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Select a binding that has security enabled. By default, all bindings, except the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> binding, have security enabled. If you do not select a secure binding, or if you disable security, be sure your network exchanges are protected in some other manner, such as being in a secured data center or on an isolated network.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Do not use duplex contracts with bindings that do not support security, or that have security disabled, unless the network exchange is secured by some other means.  \n  \n## System-Provided Bindings  \n The following bindings are shipped with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n|Binding|Configuration Element|Description|  \n|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>|[\\<basicHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md)|A binding that is suitable for communicating with WS-Basic Profile conformant Web services, for example, ASP.NET Web services (ASMX)-based services.
