Although it's possible to have variables and values whose compile time types are `MustInherit`, such variables and values will necessarily either be a null value or contain references to instances of regular classes derived from the `MustInherit` types.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30569  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the `New` operator.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [MustInherit](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustinherit.md)\n- [New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,223],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30569\"\n  - \"bc30569\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30569\"\nms.assetid: 94c9e6a3-6489-4d58-b7e5-7b4203677e3b","nodes":[{"content":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","nodes":[{"content":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[230,292],"content":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","linkify":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","nodes":[{"content":"'New' cannot be used on a class that is declared 'MustInherit'","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`MustInherit`</ph> class cannot be instantiated directly, and therefore the <ph id=\"ph2\">`New`</ph> operator cannot be used on a <ph id=\"ph3\">`MustInherit`</ph> class.","pos":[293,421],"source":"A `MustInherit` class cannot be instantiated directly, and therefore the `New` operator cannot be used on a `MustInherit` class."},{"content":"Although it's possible to have variables and values whose compile time types are <ph id=\"ph1\">`MustInherit`</ph>, such variables and values will necessarily either be a null value or contain references to instances of regular classes derived from the <ph id=\"ph2\">`MustInherit`</ph> types.","pos":[422,675],"source":" Although it's possible to have variables and values whose compile time types are `MustInherit`, such variables and values will necessarily either be a null value or contain references to instances of regular classes derived from the `MustInherit` types."},{"pos":[682,703],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30569","source":"**Error ID:** BC30569"},{"pos":[712,733],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[743,769],"content":"Remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`New`</ph> operator.","source":"Remove the `New` operator."},{"pos":[778,786],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[790,867],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>MustInherit<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustinherit.md)</ept>","source":"[MustInherit](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustinherit.md)"},{"pos":[870,949],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>New Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)"}]}
