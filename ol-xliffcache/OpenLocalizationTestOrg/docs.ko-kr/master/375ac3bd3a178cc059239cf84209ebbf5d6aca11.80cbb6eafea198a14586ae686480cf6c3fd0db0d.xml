For example, you may want to show the contents of a two-dimensional array of strings. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> class provides an easy and highly customizable way to display data without binding to a data source. This walkthrough shows how to populate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and manage the addition and deletion of rows in \"unbound\" mode. By default, the user can add new rows. To prevent row addition, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A> property is `false`.  \n  \n To copy the code in this topic as a single listing, see [How to: Create an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-create-an-unbound-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## Creating the Form  \n  \n#### To use an unbound DataGridView control  \n  \n1.  Create a class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> and contains the following variable declarations and `Main` method.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#01](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#01)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#01](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#01)]  \n    [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#02](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#02)]\n    [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#02](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#02)]  \n  \n2.  Implement a `SetupLayout` method in your form's class definition to set up the form's layout.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#20](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#20)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#20](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#20)]  \n  \n3.  Create a `SetupDataGridView` method to set up the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> columns and properties.  \n  \n     This method first adds the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> collection. Next, the number of columns to be displayed is set using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ColumnCount%2A> property. The default style for the column headers is set by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle.ForeColor%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle.Font%2A> properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle> returned by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ColumnHeadersDefaultCellStyle%2A> property.  \n  \n     Layout and appearance properties are set, and then the column names are assigned. When this method exits, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control is ready to be populated.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#30](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#30)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#30](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#30)]  \n  \n4.  Create a `PopulateDataGridView` method to add rows to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n     Each row represents a song and its associated information.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#40](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#40)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#40](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#40)]  \n  \n5.  With the utility methods in place, you can attach event handlers.  \n  \n     You will handle the **Add** and **Delete** buttons' <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> events, the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting> event.  \n  \n     When the **Add** button's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event is raised, a new, empty row is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>.  \n  \n     When the **Delete** button's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event is raised, the selected row is deleted, unless it is the row for new records, which enables the user add new rows. This row is always the last row in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n     When the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event is raised, the `SetupLayout`, `SetupDataGridView`, and `PopulateDataGridView` utility methods are called.  \n  \n     When the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting> event is raised, each cell in the `Date` column is formatted as a long date, unless the cell's value cannot be parsed.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#10)]  \n  \n## Testing the Application  \n You can now test the form to make sure it behaves as expected.  \n  \n#### To test the form  \n  \n-   Press F5 to run the application.  \n  \n     You will see a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control that displays the songs listed in `PopulateDataGridView`. You can add new rows with the **Add Row** button, and you can delete selected rows with the **Delete Row** button. The unbound <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control is the data store, and its data is independent of any external source, such as a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or an array.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n This application gives you a basic understanding of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's capabilities. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control in several ways:  \n  \n-   Change border and header styles. For more information, see [How to: Change the Border and Gridline Styles in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](change-the-border-and-gridline-styles-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n-   Enable or restrict user input to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For more information, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-datagridview.md), and [How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-make-columns-read-only-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Check user input for database-related errors. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Handling Errors that Occur During Data Entry in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](handling-errors-that-occur-during-data-entry-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n-   Handle very large data sets using virtual mode. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Virtual Mode in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](implementing-virtual-mode-wf-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Customize the appearance of cells. For more information, see [How to: Customize the Appearance of Cells in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](customize-the-appearance-of-cells-in-the-datagrid.md) and [How to: Set Default Cell Styles for the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-set-default-cell-styles-for-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n-
