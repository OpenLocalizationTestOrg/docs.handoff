A              <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> is a type of              <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> that enables you to draw a shape to the screen. Because they are UI elements,              <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> objects can be used inside              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> elements and most controls.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] offers several layers of access to graphics and rendering services. At the top layer,              <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> objects are easy to use and provide many useful features, such as layout and participation in the              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] event system.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"shapes\"></a>   \n## Shape Objects  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides a number of ready-to-use                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> objects.  All shape objects inherit from the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> class. Available shape objects include                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, and                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle>.                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> objects share the following common properties.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A>: Describes how the shape's outline is painted.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A>: Describes the thickness of the shape's outline.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>: Describes how the interior of the shape is painted.  \n  \n-   Data properties to specify coordinates and vertices, measured in device-independent pixels.  \n  \n Because they derive from                  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement>, shape objects can be used inside panels and most controls                 . The                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> panel is a particularly good choice for creating complex drawings because it supports absolute positioning of its child objects.  \n  \n The                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> class enables you to draw a line between two points. The following example shows several ways to specify line coordinates and stroke properties.  \n  \n [!code-xml[drawingwithshapeelements#LineExample1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/lineexample.xaml#lineexample1)]  \n  \n [!code-cpp[shapesprocedural#ShapesProceduralLine](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ShapesProcedural/CPP/ShapesProcedural.cpp#shapesproceduralline)]\n [!code-csharp[shapesprocedural#ShapesProceduralLine](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ShapesProcedural/Csharp/ShapesProcedural.cs#shapesproceduralline)]\n [!code-vb[shapesprocedural#ShapesProceduralLine](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ShapesProcedural/VisualBasic/ShapesProceduralVB.vb#shapesproceduralline)]  \n  \n The following image shows the rendered                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>.  \n  \n ![Line illustration](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/media/shape-ovw-line2.gif \"shape_ovw_line2\")  \n  \n Although the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> class does provide a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> property, setting it has no effect because a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> has no area.  \n  \n Another common shape is the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse>.

These curves and shapes are described using                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> objects. To use a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path>, you create a                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> and use it to set the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> object's                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path.Data%2A> property.  \n  \n There are a variety of                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> objects to choose from. The                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.LineGeometry>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RectangleGeometry>, and                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry> classes describe relatively simple shapes.                  To create more complex shapes or create curves, use a                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathGeometry>.  \n  \n<a name=\"pathgeometry\"></a>   \n### PathGeometry and PathSegments  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathGeometry> objects are comprised of one or more                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathFigure> objects; each                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathFigure> represents a different \"figure\" or shape. Each                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathFigure> is itself comprised of one or more                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathSegment> objects, each representing a connected portion of the figure or shape. Segment types include the following:                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.LineSegment>,                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.BezierSegment>, and                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.ArcSegment>.  \n  \n In the following example, a                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> is used to draw a quadratic Bezier curve.  \n  \n [!code-xml[geometrysample#34](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GeometrySample/CS/pathgeometryexample.xaml#34)]  \n  \n The following image shows the rendered shape.  \n  \n ![Path illustration](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/media/shape-ovw-path2.gif \"shape_ovw_path2\")  \n  \n For more information about                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathGeometry> and the other                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry> classes, see the                          [Geometry Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/geometry-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"pathdatastring\"></a>   \n### XAML Abbreviated Syntax  \n In                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], you may also use a special abbreviated syntax to describe a                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path>. In the following example, abbreviated syntax is used to draw a complex shape.  \n  \n```xaml  \n  \n      <Path Stroke=\"DarkGoldenRod\" StrokeThickness=\"3\"   \nData=\"M 100,200 C 100,25 400,350 400,175 H 280\" />  \n  \n```  \n  \n The following image shows a rendered                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path>.  \n  \n ![Path illustration](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/media/shape-ovw-path.PNG \"shape_ovw_path\")  \n  \n The                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path.Data%2A> attribute string begins with the \"moveto\" command, indicated by M, which establishes a start point for the path in the coordinate system of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>.                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> data parameters are case-sensitive. The capital                          M                          indicates an absolute location for the new current point. A lowercase m would indicate relative coordinates. The first segment is a cubic Bezier curve beginning at (100,200) and ending at (400,175), drawn using the two control points (100,25) and (400,350). This segment is indicated by the C command in the                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path.Data%2A> attribute string. Again, the capital C indicates an absolute path; the lowercase c would indicate a relative path.  \n  \n The second segment begins with an absolute horizontal \"lineto\" command H, which specifies a line drawn from the preceding subpath's endpoint (400,175) to a new endpoint (280,175). Because it is a horizontal \"lineto\" command, the value specified is an                          *x*-coordinate.  \n  \n For the complete path syntax, see the                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path.Data%2A> reference and                          [Create a Shape by Using a PathGeometry](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-create-a-shape-by-using-a-pathgeometry.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"fillpaint\"></a>   \n## Painting Shapes  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> objects are used to paint a shape's                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>. In the following example, the stroke and fill of an                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> are specified.

For more information, see the                  [Painting with Solid Colors and Gradients Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/painting-with-solid-colors-and-gradients-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"stretchableshapessection\"></a>   \n## Stretchable Shapes  \n The                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon>,                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, and                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle> classes all have a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stretch%2A> property. This property determines how a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents (the shape to be drawn) is stretched to fill the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's layout space. A                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's layout space is the amount of space the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> is allocated by the layout system, because of either an explicit                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> setting or because of its                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A>settings                 .                  For additional information on layout in Windows Presentation Foundation, see                  [Layout](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md) overview.  \n  \n The Stretch property takes one of the following values:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch>: The                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents are not stretched.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch>: The                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents are stretched to fill its layout space.  Aspect ratio is not preserved.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch>: The                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents are stretched as much as possible to fill its layout space while preserving its original aspect ratio.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Media.Stretch>: The                          <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents are stretched to completely fill its layout space while preserving its original aspect ratio.  \n  \n Note that, when a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's contents are stretched, the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> object's outline is painted after the stretching.  \n  \n In the following example, a                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> is used to draw a very small triangle from (0,0) to (0,1) to (1,1). The                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> object's                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> are set to 100, and its stretch property is set to Fill. As a result, the                  <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> object's contents (the triangle) are stretched to fill the larger space.  \n  \n```  \n...  \n<Polygon  \n  Points=\"0,0 0,1 1,1\"  \n  Fill=\"Blue\"  \n  Width=\"100\"  \n  Height=\"100\"  \n  Stretch=\"Fill\"  \n  Stroke=\"Black\"  \n  StrokeThickness=\"2\" />  \n...  \n```  \n  \n```  \n...  \nPointCollection myPointCollection = new PointCollection();  \nmyPointCollection.Add(new Point(0,0));  \nmyPointCollection.Add(new Point(0,1));  \nmyPointCollection.Add(new Point(1,1));  \n  \nPolygon myPolygon = new Polygon();  \nmyPolygon.Points = myPointCollection;  \nmyPolygon.Fill = Brushes.Blue;  \nmyPolygon.Width = 100;  \nmyPolygon.Height = 100;  \nmyPolygon.Stretch = Stretch.Fill;  \nmyPolygon.Stroke = Brushes.Black;  \nmyPolygon.StrokeThickness = 2;  \n...  \n```  \n  \n<a name=\"transforms\"></a>   \n## Transforming Shapes  \n The                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Transform> class provides the means to transform shapes in a two-dimensional plane.  The different types of transformation include rotation (                 <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform>), scale (                 <xref:System.Windows.Media.ScaleTransform>), skew (                 <xref:System.Windows.Media.SkewTransform>), and translation (                 <xref:System.Windows.Media.TranslateTransform>).  \n  \n A common transform to apply to a shape is a rotation.  To rotate a shape, create a                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform> and specify its                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.Angle%2A>. An                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.Angle%2A> of 45 rotates the element 45 degrees clockwise; an angle of 90 rotates the element 90 degrees clockwise; and so on. Set the                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.CenterX%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.CenterY%2A> properties if you want to control the point about which the element is rotated. These property values are expressed in the coordinate space of the element being transformed.                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.CenterX%2A> and                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform.CenterY%2A> have default values of zero. Finally, apply the                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform> to the element. If you don't want the transform to affect layout, set the shape's                  <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.RenderTransform%2A>property                 .  \n  \n In the following example, a                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.RotateTransform> is used to rotate a shape 45 degrees about the shape's top left corner (0,0).  \n  \n [!code-xml[transformssample#14](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/transformsSample/CS/RotateTransformExample.xaml#14)]  \n  \n In the next example, another shape is rotated 45 degrees, but this time it's rotated about the point (25,50).  \n  \n [!code-xml[transformssample#15](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/transformsSample/CS/RotateTransformExample.xaml#15)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the results of applying the two transforms.  \n  \n ![45 degree rotations with different center points](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/media/wcpsdk-graphicsmm-rotatetransform45degrees.gif \"wcpsdk_graphicsmm_rotatetransform45degrees\")  \n  \n In the previous examples, a single transform was applied to each shape object. To apply multiple transforms to a shape (or any other UI element), use a                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.TransformGroup>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [2D Graphics and
