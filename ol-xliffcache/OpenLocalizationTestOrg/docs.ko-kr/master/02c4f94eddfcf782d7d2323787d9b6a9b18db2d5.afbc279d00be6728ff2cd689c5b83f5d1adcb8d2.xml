This example also illustrates how to display a property with an enumeration type in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxColumn> so that the combo box drop-down list contains the enumeration values.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView._CollectionBound#00](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView._CollectionBound/CS/collectionbound.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView._CollectionBound#00](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView._CollectionBound/VB/collectionbound.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
