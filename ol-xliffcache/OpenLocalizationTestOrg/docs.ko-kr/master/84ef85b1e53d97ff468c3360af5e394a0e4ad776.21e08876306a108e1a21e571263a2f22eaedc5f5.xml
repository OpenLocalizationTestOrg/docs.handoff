[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates your changes into the appropriate SQL `UPDATE` commands.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations. For more information, see [Customizing Insert, Update, and Delete Operations](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/customizing-insert-update-and-delete-operations.md).  \n>   \n>  Developers using Visual Studio can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to develop stored procedures for the same purpose.  \n  \n The following steps assume that a valid <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> connects you to the Northwind database. For more information, see [How to: Connect to a Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-connect-to-a-database.md).  \n  \n### To update a row in the database  \n  \n1.  Query the database for the row to be updated.  \n  \n2.  Make desired changes to member values in the resulting [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object.  \n  \n3.  Submit the changes to the database.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example queries the database for order #11000, and then changes the values of `ShipName` and `ShipVia` in the resulting `Order` object. Finally, the changes to these member values are submitted to the database as changes in the `ShipName` and `ShipVia` columns.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Data.Linq.Table#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/system.data.linq.table/cs/program.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Data.Linq.Table#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/system.data.linq.table/vb/module1.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Manage Change Conflicts](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-manage-change-conflicts.md)\n- [How to: Assign stored procedures to perform updates, inserts, and deletes (O/R Designer)](/visualstudio/data-tools/how-to-assign-stored-procedures-to-perform-updates-inserts-and-deletes-o-r-designer)\n- [Making and Submitting Data Changes](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/making-and-submitting-data-changes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,153],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Update Rows in the Database\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: a2b5c90f-6cc3-4128-bfab-1db488d5af26","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","pos":[0,35]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[160,195],"content":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","linkify":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Update Rows in the Database","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"You can update rows in a database by modifying member values of the objects associated with the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601&gt;</ph> collection and then submitting the changes to the database.","pos":[196,453],"source":"You can update rows in a database by modifying member values of the objects associated with the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601> collection and then submitting the changes to the database."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> translates your changes into the appropriate SQL <ph id=\"ph2\">`UPDATE`</ph> commands.","pos":[454,589],"source":"[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates your changes into the appropriate SQL `UPDATE` commands."},{"pos":[597,951],"content":"[!NOTE]\n You can override [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` database operations.
