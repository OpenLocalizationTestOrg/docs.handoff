This topic demonstrates how to determine the amount of time a service operation takes to complete.  \n  \n### Determining service operation execution duration  \n  \n1.  Open Event Viewer by clicking **Start**, **Run**, and entering `eventvwr.exe`.  \n  \n2.  If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Windows**, **Application Server-Applications**. Select **View**, **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**. Right-click **Analytic** and select **Enable Log**. Leave Event Viewer open so that traces can be viewed after the service operation is run.  \n  \n3.  Next, open a WCF application that includes a service project and a client project that interacts with that service.  You can create such an application by following the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  If you have the WCF samples installed, you can open the [Getting Started](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which contains the completed project created in the tutorial.  \n  \n4.  Execute the server application by pressing **F5**. Execute the client application by right-clicking on the **Client** project and selecting **Debug**, **Start New Instance**.  \n  \n5.  In Event Viewer, refresh the Analytic log and sort the events by Event ID.  Look for events with Event ID [214 - OperationCompleted](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/214-operationcompleted.md).  These events will show which operations have completed, and what the duration of the operation was.  The following event shows the duration of an Add operation.  \n  \n    ```Output  \n    An OperationInvoker completed the call to the 'Add' method.  The method call duration was '3' ms.  \n    ```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,122],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Determining service operation duration\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: e8a93a2c-2c20-48b3-8986-57e90e9aa908","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation duration","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Determining service operation duration","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation duration","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[129,167],"content":"Determining service operation duration","linkify":"Determining service operation duration","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation duration","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"If analytic tracing is enabled in a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application, the duration of execution for a service operation can easily be determined by examining the event log.","pos":[168,358]},{"content":"This topic demonstrates how to determine the amount of time a service operation takes to complete.","pos":[360,458]},{"pos":[468,516],"content":"Determining service operation execution duration","linkify":"Determining service operation execution duration","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation execution duration","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[526,604],"content":"Open Event Viewer by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Run<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and entering <ph id=\"ph1\">`eventvwr.exe`</ph>.","source":"Open Event Viewer by clicking **Start**, **Run**, and entering `eventvwr.exe`."},{"content":"If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Applications and Services Logs<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Microsoft<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Windows<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Application Server-Applications<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept>.","pos":[614,762],"source":"If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Windows**, **Application Server-Applications**."},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>View<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Show Analytic and Debug Logs<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[763,813],"source":" Select **View**, **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**."},{"content":"Right-click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Analytic<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> and select <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Enable Log<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[814,865],"source":" Right-click **Analytic** and select **Enable Log**."},{"content":"Leave Event Viewer open so that traces can be viewed after the service operation is run.","pos":[866,954]},{"content":"Next, open a WCF application that includes a service project and a client project that interacts with that service.","pos":[964,1079]},{"content":"You can create such an application by following the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started Tutorial<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md)</ept>.","pos":[1081,1223],"source":"  You can create such an application by following the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md)."},{"content":"If you have the WCF samples installed, you can open the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md)</ept>, which contains the completed project created in the tutorial.","pos":[1225,1430],"source":"  If you have the WCF samples installed, you can open the [Getting Started](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which contains the completed project created in the tutorial."},{"content":"Execute the server application by pressing <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>F5<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1440,1490],"source":"Execute the server application by pressing **F5**."},{"content":"Execute the client application by right-clicking on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Client<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project and selecting <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Debug<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Start New Instance<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","pos":[1491,1614],"source":" Execute the client application by right-clicking on the **Client** project and selecting **Debug**, **Start New Instance**."},{"content":"In Event Viewer, refresh the Analytic log and sort the events by Event ID.","pos":[1624,1698]},{"content":"Look for events with Event ID <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>214 - OperationCompleted<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/214-operationcompleted.md)</ept>.","pos":[1700,1834],"source":"  Look for events with Event ID [214 - OperationCompleted](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/214-operationcompleted.md)."},{"content":"These events will show which operations have completed, and what the duration of the operation was.","pos":[1836,1935]},{"content":"The following event shows the duration of an Add operation.","pos":[1937,1996]}]}
