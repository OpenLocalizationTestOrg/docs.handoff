The service moniker can be used from a wide range of COM-based development environments, such as Office VBA, Visual Basic 6.0, or Visual C++ 6.0.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Integrating with COM Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-applications-overview.md)  \n Gives an overview of the major parts of the integration process.  \n  \n [How to: Register and Configure a Service Moniker](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-register-and-configure-a-service-moniker.md)  \n To use the WCF service moniker within a COM application, register the required attributed types with COM, and configure the COM application and the moniker with the required binding configuration.  \n  \n [How to: Use the Windows Communication Foundation Service Moniker without Registration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/use-the-wcf-service-moniker-without-registration.md)  \n Explains how to obtain the definition of the contract in the form of a Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) document or from a WS-MetadataExchange endpoint.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Service Moniker with WSDL Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-a-service-moniker-with-wsdl-contracts.md)  \n Describes how to call a WCF sample using a WCF WSDL moniker.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Service Moniker with Metadata Exchange Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-a-service-moniker-with-metadata-exchange-contracts.md)  \n Describes how to call a WCF sample using a WCF moniker that specifies a Mex endpoint.  \n  \n [How to: Specify Channel Security Credentials](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-specify-channel-security-credentials.md)  \n The WCF service moniker supports the `IChannelCredentials` interface that allows a range of alternate methods for specifying channel credentials.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Integrating with COM+
