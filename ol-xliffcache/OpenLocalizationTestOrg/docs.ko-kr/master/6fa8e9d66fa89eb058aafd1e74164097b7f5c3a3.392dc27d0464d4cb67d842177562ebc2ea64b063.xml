For more information, see [Updating the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/updating-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to create an existing `Customer` object that contains changes to be saved to the data service. The object is attached to the context and the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.UpdateObject%2A> method is called to mark the attached object as <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.EntityStates.Modified> before the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SaveChanges%2A> method is called.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#AttachObject](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#attachobject)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#AttachObject](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#attachobject)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WCF Data Services Client Library](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,258],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Attach an Existing Entity to the DataServiceContext (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
