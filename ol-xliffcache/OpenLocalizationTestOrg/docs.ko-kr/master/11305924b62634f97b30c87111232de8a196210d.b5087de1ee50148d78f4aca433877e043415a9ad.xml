For example, if you are developing an application where a particular group of settings is expected to change frequently, it might be wise to separate them all into a single file so that the file can be replaced wholesale, leaving other settings unaffected. Visual Studio allows you to add multiple sets of settings to your project. Additional sets of settings can be accessed via the Properties.Settings object.  \n  \n### To Add an Additional Set of Setting to your Application  \n  \n1.  From the **Project** menu, choose **Add New Item**. The **Add New Item** dialog box opens.  \n  \n2.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Settings File**, type in a name for the file, and click **Add** to add a new settings file to your solution.  \n  \n3.  In **Solution Explorer**, drag the new Settings file into the **Properties** folder. This allows your new settings to be available in code.  \n  \n4.  Add and use settings in this file as you would any other settings file. You can access this group of settings via the Properties.Settings object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)   \n [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,549],"nodes":[{"content":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C# | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,80],"content":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C# | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C# | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,80]}]}],"pos":[6,89],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C# | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application settings [Windows Forms], multiple sets\"\n  - \"application settings [Windows Forms], C#\"\nms.assetid: 45007ac6-cf07-4be7-bc38-3f0ef962faf9\ncaps.latest.revision: 8\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[556,619],"content":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C#","linkify":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C#","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Add Multiple Sets of Settings To Your Application in C#","pos":[0,63]}]},{"content":"In some cases, you might want to have multiple sets of settings in an application.","pos":[622,704]},{"content":"For example, if you are developing an application where a particular group of settings is expected to change frequently, it might be wise to separate them all into a single file so that the file can be replaced wholesale, leaving other settings unaffected.","pos":[705,961]},{"content":"Visual Studio allows you to add multiple sets of settings to your project.","pos":[962,1036]},{"content":"Additional sets of settings can be accessed via the Properties.Settings object.","pos":[1037,1116]},{"pos":[1126,1181],"content":"To Add an Additional Set of Setting to your Application","linkify":"To Add an Additional Set of Setting to your Application","nodes":[{"content":"To Add an Additional Set of Setting to your Application","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"From the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Project<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> menu, choose <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Add New Item<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1191,1242],"source":"From the **Project** menu, choose **Add New Item**."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add New Item<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box opens.","pos":[1243,1281],"source":" The **Add New Item** dialog box opens."},{"pos":[1291,1444],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add New Item<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box, select <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Settings File<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, type in a name for the file, and click <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Add<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> to add a new settings file to your solution.","source":"In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select **Settings File**, type in a name for the file, and click **Add** to add a new settings file to your solution."},{"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, drag the new Settings file into the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> folder.","pos":[1454,1538],"source":"In **Solution Explorer**, drag the new Settings file into the **Properties** folder."},{"content":"This allows your new settings to be available in code.","pos":[1539,1593]},{"content":"Add and use settings in this file as you would any other settings file.","pos":[1603,1674]},{"content":"You can access this group of settings via the Properties.Settings object.","pos":[1675,1748]},{"pos":[1757,1765],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Settings and User Settings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1769,1910],"source":"[Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Application Settings Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1914,2024],"source":"[Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)"}]}
