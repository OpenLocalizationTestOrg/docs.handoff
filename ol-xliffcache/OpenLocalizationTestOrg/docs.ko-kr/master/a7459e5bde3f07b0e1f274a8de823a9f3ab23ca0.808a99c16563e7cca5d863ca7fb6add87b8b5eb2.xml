The control displays and sets a single numeric value from a list of choices. The user can increase and decrease the number by clicking up and down buttons, by pressing the UP and DOWN ARROW keys, or by typing a number. Clicking the UP ARROW key moves the value toward its maximum; clicking the DOWN ARROW key moves the position toward the minimum. An example where this kind of control might be useful is for a volume control on a music player. Numeric up-down controls are used in some Windows control panel applications.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [NumericUpDown Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/numericupdown-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `NumericUpDown` control, which allows users to browse through and select from a list of numeric values.  \n  \n [How to: Set and Return Numeric Values with the Windows Forms NumericUpDown Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/set-and-return-numeric-values-with-wf-numericupdown-control.md)  \n Describes how to test for the value of the control.  \n  \n [How to: Set the Format for the Windows Forms NumericUpDown Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-format-for-the-windows-forms-numericupdown-control.md)  \n Describes how to configure how values are displayed in the control.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown>  \n Provides reference information on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown> class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [DomainUpDown Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/domainupdown-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces a control similar to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NumericUpDown>, except that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DomainUpDown> control displays string instead of numeric values.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":"NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[659,696],"content":"NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"NumericUpDown Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`NumericUpDown`</ph> control looks like a combination of a text box and a pair of arrows that the user can click to adjust a value.","pos":[697,841],"source":"The Windows Forms `NumericUpDown` control looks like a combination of a text box and a pair of arrows that the user can click to adjust a value."},{"content":"The control displays and sets a single numeric value from a list of choices.","pos":[842,918]},{"content":"The user can increase and decrease the number by clicking up and down buttons, by pressing the UP and DOWN ARROW keys, or by typing a number.","pos":[919,1060]},{"content":"Clicking the UP ARROW key moves the value toward its maximum;
