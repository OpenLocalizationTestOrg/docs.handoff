It also shows you how to add properties and methods to the new class, and demonstrates how to initialize an object.  \n  \n[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](~/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  \n  \n## To define a class\n  \n1.  Create a project by clicking **New Project** on the **File** menu. The **New Project** dialog box appears.  \n  \n2.  Select Windows Application from the list of Visual Basic project templates to display the new project.  \n  \n3.  Add a new class to the project by clicking **Add Class** on the **Project** menu. The **Add New Item** dialog box appears.  \n  \n4.  Select the **Class** template.  \n  \n5.  Name the new class `UserNameInfo.vb`, and then click **Add** to display the code for the new class.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#5)]\n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can use the Visual Basic **Code Editor** to add a class to your startup form by typing the `Class` keyword followed by the name of the new class. The **Code Editor** provides a corresponding `End Class` statement for you.  \n  \n6.  Define a private field for the class by adding the following code between the `Class` and `End Class` statements:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#7)]\n  \n     Declaring the field as `Private` means it can be used only within the class. You can make fields available from outside a class by using access modifiers such as `Public` that provide more access. For more information, see [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md).  \n  \n7.  Define a property for the class by adding the following code:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#8)]\n  \n8.  Define a method for the class by adding the following code:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#9)]\n  \n9. Define a parameterized constructor for the new class by adding a procedure named `Sub New`:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#10)]\n  \n     The `Sub New` constructor is called automatically when an object based on this class is created. This constructor sets the value of the field that holds the user name.  \n  \n## To create a button to test the class\n  \n1.  Change the startup form to design mode by right-clicking its name in **Solution Explorer** and then clicking **View Designer**. By default, the startup form for Windows Application projects is named Form1.vb. The main form will then appear.  \n  \n2.  Add a button to the main form and double-click it to display the code for the `Button1_Click` event handler. Add the following code to call the test procedure:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOOP/VB/OOP.vb#12)]\n  \n## To run your application\n  \n1.  Run your application by pressing F5. Click the button on the form to call the test procedure. It displays a message stating that the original `UserName` is \"MOORE, BOBBY\", because the procedure called the `Capitalize` method of the object.  \n  \n2.  Click **OK** to dismiss the message box. The `Button1 Click` procedure changes the value of the `UserName` property and displays a message stating that the new value of `UserName` is \"Worden, Joe\".  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Object-Oriented Programming (Visual Basic)](../../concepts/object-oriented-programming.md)\n- [Objects and Classes](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,571],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Defining Classes (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"execution [Visual Basic], ending\"\n  - \"objects [Visual Basic], initializing\"\n  - \"Initialize event [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"files [Visual Basic], closing\"\n  - \"programs [Visual Basic], quitting\"\n  - \"code, exiting\"\n  - \"objects [Visual Basic], creating\"\n  - \"program termination\"\n  - \"classes [Visual Basic], walkthroughs\"\n  - \"class modules, walkthroughs\"\n  - \"Terminate event [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"execution [Visual Basic], stopping\"\nms.assetid: 07018828-2d49-4cf5-a44b-19fb15d9efea","nodes":[{"content":"Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,31],"content":"Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,31]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[578,622],"content":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough demonstrates how to define classes, which you can then use to create objects.","pos":[624,718]},{"content":"It also shows you how to add properties and methods to the new class, and demonstrates how to initialize an object.","pos":[719,834]},{"pos":[922,939],"content":"To define a class","linkify":"To define a class","nodes":[{"content":"To define a class","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Create a project by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>New Project<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>File<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[947,1013],"source":"Create a project by clicking **New Project** on the **File** menu."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>New Project<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box appears.","pos":[1014,1053],"source":" The **New Project** dialog box appears."},{"content":"Select Windows Application from the list of Visual Basic project templates to display the new project.","pos":[1063,1165]},{"content":"Add a new class to the project by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add Class<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Project<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[1175,1256],"source":"Add a new class to the project by clicking **Add Class** on the **Project** menu."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add New Item<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box appears.","pos":[1257,1297],"source":" The **Add New Item** dialog box appears."},{"pos":[1307,1337],"content":"Select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Class<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> template.","source":"Select the **Class** template."},{"pos":[1347,1446],"content":"Name the new class <ph id=\"ph1\">`UserNameInfo.vb`</ph>, and then click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to display the code for the new class.","source":"Name the new class `UserNameInfo.vb`, and then click **Add** to display the code for the new class."},{"pos":[1567,1807],"content":"[!NOTE]\nYou can use the Visual Basic **Code Editor** to add a class to your startup form by typing the `Class` keyword followed by the name of the new class.
