The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form. To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The Arial font is not installed.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat.FormatFlags%2A>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormatFlags>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>\n- [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)\n- [Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,436],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"StringFormat.FormatFlags\"\n  - \"Graphics.DrawString\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"text [Windows Forms], drawing vertical\"\n  - \"strings [Windows Forms], drawing vertical\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], drawing\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], vertical text\"\nms.assetid: 717a6131-00f6-4373-b574-9894e8317799","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[443,487],"content":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","linkify":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Vertical Text on a Windows Form","pos":[0,44]}]},{"pos":[488,656],"content":"The following code example shows how to draw vertical text on a form by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A&gt;</ph> method of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph>.","source":"The following code example shows how to draw vertical text on a form by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method of <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>."},{"pos":[665,672],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1115,1133],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"You cannot call this method in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load&gt;</ph> event handler.","pos":[1137,1224],"source":"You cannot call this method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler."},{"content":"The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form.","pos":[1225,1314]},{"content":"To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1315,1437],"source":" To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method."},{"pos":[1446,1464],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1468,1516]},{"content":"The Arial font is not installed.","pos":[1526,1558]},{"pos":[1567,1575],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1769,1858],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started with Graphics Programming<ept id=\"p1\">](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)</ept>","source":"[Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)"},{"pos":[1861,1908],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Fonts and Text<ept id=\"p1\">](using-fonts-and-text.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)"}]}
