set of primer topics that you should understand to become a proficient [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)] programmer.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Designing Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/designing-workflows.md)  \n Topics that describe the flow-control paradigms used in workflow development.  \n  \n [Using and Creating Activities](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-and-creating-activities.md)  \n Topics that describes the system-provided activities available in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n [Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/data-model.md)  \n Topics that describe variables, arguments and expressions in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)].  \n  \n [Waiting for Input in a Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/waiting-for-input-in-a-workflow.md)  \n Topics that describes how to use bookmarks and messaging activities.  \n  \n [Exceptions, Transactions, and Compensation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/exceptions-transactions-and-compensation.md)  \n Topics that describe how to use exception handlers, transactions, and compensation to handle run-time errors.  \n  \n [Hosting Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/hosting-workflows.md)  \n Topics that describe the details for writing workflow host applications.  \n  \n [Dynamic Update](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/dynamic-update.md)  \n Describes how to use dynamic update to update the workflow definition of a persisted workflow instance.  \n  \n [Workflow Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-services.md)  \n Topics that describe the programming model that supports writing services declaratively.  \n  \n [Workflow Persistence](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-persistence.md)  \n Topics that describe the options for automatically or manually persisting workflow data and unloading workflows from memory.  \n  \n [Migration Guidance](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/migration-guidance.md)  \n Topics that describe how to migrate workflows from previous versions of [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)  \n Topics that describe workflow tracking and tracing and how these features are used for monitoring workflow applications.  \n  \n [Workflow Security](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-security.md)  \n Discusses how to keep your workflow secure when using SQL and [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)].  \n  \n [Windows Workflow Foundation 4 Performance](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/performance.md)  \n Discusses [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../includes/wf2-md.md)] 4 performance and compares it to the previous version of WF.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Programming | Microsoft
