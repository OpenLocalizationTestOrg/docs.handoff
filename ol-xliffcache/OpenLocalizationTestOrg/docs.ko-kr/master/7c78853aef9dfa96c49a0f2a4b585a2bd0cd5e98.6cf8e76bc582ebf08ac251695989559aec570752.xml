These features provide critical support for the different text rendering requirements in each of the following scenarios.  \n  \n1.  Screen display of fixed-format documents.  \n  \n2.  Print scenarios.  \n  \n    -   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] as a device printer language.  \n  \n    -   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mxdw](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mxdw-md.md)].  \n  \n    -   Previous printer drivers, output from [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] applications to the fixed format.  \n  \n    -   Print spool format.  \n  \n3.

[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides several elements for general layout and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] scenarios such as <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock>. For more information on layout and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] scenarios, see the [Typography in WPF](typography-in-wpf.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"text_glyphrunovw_glyphrunobject\"></a>   \n## The GlyphRun Object  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun> object represents a sequence of glyphs from a single face of a single font at a single size, and with a single rendering style.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun> includes both font details such as glyph <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.Indices%2A> and individual glyph positions. It also includes the original [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_unicode](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-unicode-md.md)] code points the run was generated from, character-to-glyph buffer offset mapping information, and per-character and per-glyph flags.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun> has a corresponding high-level <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>, <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs>. <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs> can be used in the element tree and in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup to represent <xref:System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun> output.  \n  \n<a name=\"text_glyphrunovw_glyphselement\"></a>   \n## The Glyphs Element  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs> element represents the output of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.GlyphRun> in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. The following markup syntax is used to describe the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs> element.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[GlyphsOvwSample1#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GlyphsOvwSample1/CS/default.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following property definitions correspond to the first four attributes in the sample markup.  \n  \n|Property|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.FontUri%2A>|Specifies a resource identifier: file name, Web [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)], or resource reference in the application .exe or container.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.FontRenderingEmSize%2A>|Specifies the font size in drawing surface units (default is .96 inches).|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.StyleSimulations%2A>|Specifies flags for bold and Italic styles.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.BidiLevel%2A>|Specifies the bidirectional layout level.

Where a sequence of glyphs forms a single cluster, the specification of the first glyph in the cluster is preceded by a specification of how many glyphs and how many code points combine to form the cluster. The <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs.Indices%2A> property collects in one string the following properties.  \n  \n-   Glyph indices  \n  \n-   Glyph advance widths  \n  \n-   Combining glyph attachment vectors  \n  \n-   Cluster mapping from code points to glyphs  \n  \n-   Glyph flags  \n  \n Each glyph specification has the following form.  \n  \n `[GlyphIndex][,[Advance][,[uOffset][,[vOffset][,[Flags]]]]]`  \n  \n<a name=\"text_glyphrunovw_glyphmetrics\"></a>   \n## Glyph Metrics  \n Each glyph defines metrics that specify how it aligns with other <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Glyphs>.
