This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Binding\\Basic\\TransportSecurity`  \n  \n## Sample Details  \n By default, the basic binding supports HTTP communication. The sample shows how to enable transport security for the basic binding. Before you run the sample, you must create a certificate and assign it by using the Web Server Certificate Wizard.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The program code in the sample is identical to that of the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) service. The endpoint definition and binding definition in the configuration file settings are modified to enable secure communication, as shown in the following sample configuration.  \n  \n```xml  \n<system.serviceModel>  \n  <services>  \n    <service type=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\"  \n             behaviorConfiguration=\"CalculatorServiceBehavior\">  \n      <endpoint address=\"\"  \n                binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"  \n                bindingConfiguration=\"Binding1\"   \n                contract=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.ICalculator\" />  \n    </service>  \n   </services>  \n  <bindings>  \n    <basicHttpBinding>  \n      <!-- Configure basicHttpBinding with Transport security -->  \n      <!-- mode and clientCredentialType set to None. -->  \n      <binding name=\"Binding1\">  \n        <security mode=\"Transport\">  \n          <transport clientCredentialType=\"None\"/>  \n        </security>  \n      </binding>  \n    </basicHttpBinding>  \n  </bindings>  \n</system.serviceModel>  \n```  \n  \n Because the certificate used in this sample is a test certificate created with Makecert.exe, a security alert appears when you try to access an HTTPS: address in your browser, such as https://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc. To allow the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client to work with a test certificate, some additional code is added to the client to suppress the security alert. This code, and the accompanying class, is not necessary when using real certificates.  \n\n```csharp\n// This code is required only for test certificates such as those   \n// created by Makecert.exe.  \nPermissiveCertificatePolicy.Enact(\"CN=ServiceModelSamples-HTTPS-Server\");  \n```\n\n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] 4.0 using the following command:  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.XXXXX\\aspnet_regiis.exe /i /enable  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  Ensure that you have performed the [Internet Information Services (IIS) Server Certificate Installation Instructions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/iis-server-certificate-installation-instructions.md).  \n  \n4.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n5.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,120],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"BasicBinding with Transport Security\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: f49b1de6-0254-4362-8ef2-fccd8ff9688b","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[127,163],"content":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","linkify":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","nodes":[{"content":"BasicBinding with Transport Security","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates the use of SSL transport security with the basic binding.","pos":[164,246]},{"content":"This sample is based on the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md)</ept> that implements a calculator service.","pos":[247,396],"source":" This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service."},{"pos":[404,536],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your machine.
