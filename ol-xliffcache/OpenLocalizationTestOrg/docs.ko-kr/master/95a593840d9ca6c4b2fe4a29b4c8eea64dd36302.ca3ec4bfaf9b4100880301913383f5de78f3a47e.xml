With the managed [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes, you can render high quality antialiased text, as well as lower quality text. Typically, higher quality rendering takes more processing time than lower quality rendering. To set the text quality level, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.TextRenderingHint%2A> property of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> to one of the elements of the <xref:System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint> enumeration  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example draws text with two different quality settings.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the output of the cod example code.  \n  \n ![Fonts Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/fontstext10.png \"FontsText10\")  \n  \n
