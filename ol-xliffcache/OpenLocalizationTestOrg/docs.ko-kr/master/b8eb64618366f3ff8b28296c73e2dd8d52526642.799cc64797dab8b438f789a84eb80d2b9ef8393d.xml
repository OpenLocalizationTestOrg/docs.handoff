You typically need to bind a control to a type at design time, when data may not be available, but you still want your data-bound controls to display data from a type's public interface. The following procedures demonstrate how to create a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> that is bound to a type, and then how to bind one of the type's properties to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>.  \n  \n### To bind the BindingSource to a type  \n  \n1.  Create a Windows Forms project.  \n  \n     For more information, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  \n  \n2.  In **Design** view, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component onto the form.  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, click the arrow for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataSource%2A> property.  \n  \n4.  In the **DataSource UI Type Editor**, click **Add Project Data Source**.  \n  \n5.  On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, select **Object** and click **Next**.  \n  \n6.  Select the type to bind to:  \n  \n    -   If the type you want to bind to is in the current project, or the assembly that contains the type is already added as a reference, expand the nodes to find the type you want, and then select it.  \n  \n         -or-  \n  \n    -   If the type you want to bind to is in another assembly, not currently in the list of references, click **Add Reference**, and then click the **Projects** tab. Select the project that contains the business object you want and click **OK**. This project will appear in the list of assemblies, so you can expand the nodes to find the type you want, and then select it.  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  If you want to bind to a type in a framework or Microsoft assembly, clear the **Hide assemblies that begin with Microsoft or System** check box.  \n  \n7.  Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.  \n  \n### To bind the control to the BindingSource  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> to the form.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, expand the **(DataBindings)** node.  \n  \n3.  Click the arrow next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property.  \n  \n4.  In the **DataSource UI Type Editor**, expand the node for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> added previously, and select the property of the bound type you want to bind to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [BindingSource
