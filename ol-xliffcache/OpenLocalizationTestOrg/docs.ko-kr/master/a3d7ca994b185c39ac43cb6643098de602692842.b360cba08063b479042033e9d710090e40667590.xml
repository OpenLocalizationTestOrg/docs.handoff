The linked documents are recommended starting points grouped according to specific interests and levels of expertise.  \n  \n To install a stand-alone version of the documentation and a Help viewer, download the [Microsoft Windows SDK v 7.1](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=194146&clcid=0x409).  \n  \n## New to Windows Communication Foundation Programming  \n  \n-   If you are new to programming with WCF and you just want to see sample applications that work, see the topics listed in [Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/index.md).  \n  \n-   For a tutorial that walks through the basic steps of creating a WCF service and client, see [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  \n  \n-   If you are interested in the concepts behind WCF, see the topics in the [Conceptual Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/conceptual-overview.md) section.  \n  \n-   To see graphic examples of client/server security configurations, see [Common Security Scenarios](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/common-security-scenarios.md).  \n  \n## Programming In-Depth  \n  \n-   If you are ready to start developing an application, see [Basic WCF Programming](../../../docs/framework/wcf/basic-wcf-programming.md).  \n  \n-   If you are looking for guidance about a particular feature or capability of WCF, see the topics under [WCF Feature Details](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/index.md).  \n  \n-   If you would like to extend or customize WCF to suit your requirements, see [Extending WCF](../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/index.md).  \n  \n-   For information about the tools that help to create and debug WCF applications, see [Windows Communication Foundation Tools](../../../docs/framework/wcf/tools.md).  \n  \n-   Configuration using XML files is a primary way of programming WCF services and clients. For reference documentation for the XML elements used in configuration files, see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  \n  \n## Troubleshooting  \n For information about troubleshooting common WCF problems, see [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md).  \n  \n## Using Windows Communication Foundation with Other Technologies  \n  \n-   To create a service that communicates with ASP.NET clients, see [How to: Configure WCF Service to Interoperate with ASP.NET Web Service Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/config-wcf-service-with-aspnet-web-service.md).  \n  \n-   Integration with [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] remoting is explained in [Migrating .NET Remoting Applications to WCF](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/migrating-net-remoting-applications-to-wcf.md).  \n  \n-   To integrate an existing COM+ application with a WCF service or client, see [Integrating with COM+ Applications Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications-overview.md).  \n  \n-   To integrate an existing COM application with a WCF service or client, see [Integrating with COM Applications](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-applications.md).  \n  \n-   To integrate an existing MSMQ application with a WCF service or client, see [How to: Exchange Queued Messages with WCF Endpoints](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-exchange-queued-messages-with-wcf-endpoints.md) and [How to: Exchange Messages with WCF Endpoints and Message Queuing Applications](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-exchange-messages-with-wcf-endpoints-and-message-queuing-applications.md).  \n  \n-   To use Internet Information Services (IIS) to host a service, see [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md).  \n  \n-   To use WCF to consume a Web Services Extensions (WSE) 3.0 service, see [How to: Access a WSE 3.0 Service](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-access-a-wse-3-0-service-with-a-wcf-client.md).  \n  \n## WS-* Protocols Supported in Windows Communication Foundation  \n To see a list of protocols supported in the system-provided bindings, see [Web Services Protocols Supported by System-Provided Interoperability Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/web-services-protocols-supported-by-system-provided-interoperability-bindings.md). To see the list of system-provided bindings, see [System-Provided Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Windows Communication Foundation
