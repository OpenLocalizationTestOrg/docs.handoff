In this example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> is populated with rows from the `Customers` table of the Northwind sample database. When the user edits a cell in the `CompanyName` column, its value is tested for validity by checking that it is not empty. If the event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellValidating> event finds that the value is an empty string, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> prevents the user from exiting the cell until a non-empty string is entered.  \n  \n For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Validating Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-validating-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewDataValidation#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewDataValidation/CS/datavalidation.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewDataValidation#00](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewDataValidation/VB/datavalidation.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Windows.Forms and System.XML assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database.
