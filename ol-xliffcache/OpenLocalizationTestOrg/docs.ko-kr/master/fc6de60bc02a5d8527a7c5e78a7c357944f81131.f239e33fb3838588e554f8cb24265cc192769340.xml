The following procedures show how to print a form to a printer, to a print preview window, and to an Encapsulated PostScript file.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n### To print a form to the default printer  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print()  \n    ```  \n  \n### To display a form in a print preview window  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print()  \n    ```  \n  \n### To print a form to a file  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Optionally, select the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintFileName%2A> property and type the full path and file name for the destination file.  \n  \n     If you skip this step, the user will be prompted for a file name at run time.  \n  \n4.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print()  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n
