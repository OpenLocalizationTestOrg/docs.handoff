The topics in this section show you how to perform this basic task in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) in a variety of ways.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Access Control Mechanisms](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/access-control-mechanisms.md)  \n Provides a brief outline of the authorization mechanisms in WCF, and suggested uses.  \n  \n [How to: Restrict Access with the PrincipalPermissionAttribute Class](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-restrict-access-with-the-principalpermissionattribute-class.md)  \n Shows the process of restricting access to a service with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermissionAttribute>.  \n  \n [How to: Use the ASP.NET Role Provider with a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-the-aspnet-role-provider-with-a-service.md)  \n Walks through the configuration of a service to enable it to use the role provider feature of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Use the ASP.NET Authorization Manager Role Provider with a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-the-aspnet-authorization-manager-role-provider-with-a-service.md)  \n [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] can use the Authorization Manager to manage authorization for a Web site. WCF can similarly leverage the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]/Authorization Manager combination for authorization of clients.  \n  \n [Managing Claims and Authorization with the Identity Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/managing-claims-and-authorization-with-the-identity-model.md)  \n Explains the basics of using the Identity Model infrastructure for claims-based authorization.  \n  \n [Delegation and Impersonation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/delegation-and-impersonation-with-wcf.md)  \n Explains the difference between delegation and impersonation.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PrincipalPermissionMode>  \n  \n
