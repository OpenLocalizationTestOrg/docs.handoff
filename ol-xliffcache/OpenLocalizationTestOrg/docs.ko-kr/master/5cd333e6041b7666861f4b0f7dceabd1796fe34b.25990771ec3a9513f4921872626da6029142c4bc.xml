MDI applications often have a Window menu item with submenus for switching between windows or documents.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are some behavior differences between MDI forms and single-document interface (SDI) windows in Windows Forms. The `Opacity` property does not affect the appearance of MDI child forms.
