In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], the <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601> class implements the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable> interface. This approach makes sure that such queries can be executed remotely. Two major benefits flow from this technique:  \n  \n-   Unnecessary data is not retrieved.  \n  \n-   A query executed by the database engine is often more efficient because of the database indexes.  \n  \n## Local Execution  \n In other situations, you might want to have the complete set of related entities in the local cache. For this purpose, <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601> provides the <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601.Load%2A> method to explicitly load all the members of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601>.  \n  \n If an <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601> is already loaded, subsequent queries are executed locally. This approach helps in two ways:  \n  \n-   If the complete set must be used locally or multiple times, you can avoid remote queries and associated latencies.  \n  \n-   The entity can be serialized as a complete entity.  \n  \n The following code fragment illustrates how local execution can be obtained:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqQueryConcepts#8](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQueryConcepts/cs/Program.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqQueryConcepts#8](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQueryConcepts/vb/Module1.vb#8)]  \n  \n## Comparison  \n These two capabilities provide a powerful combination of options: remote execution for large collections and local execution for small collections or where the complete collection is needed. You implement remote execution through <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable>, and local execution against an in-memory <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> collection. To force local execution (that is, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>), see [Convert a Type to a Generic IEnumerable](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/convert-a-type-to-a-generic-ienumerable.md).  \n  \n### Queries Against Unordered Sets  \n Note the important difference between a local collection that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> and a collection that provides remote queries executed against *unordered sets* in a relational database. <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> methods such as those that use index values require list semantics, which typically cannot be obtained through a remote query against an unordered set. For this reason, such methods implicitly load the <xref:System.Data.Linq.EntitySet%601> to allow local execution.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Query
