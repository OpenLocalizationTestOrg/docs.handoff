Member access (`.`) and dictionary member access (`!`) require an expression specifying the element that contains the member. This must appear immediately to the left of the accessor or as the target of a `With` block containing the member access.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30157  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the `With` block is correctly formatted.  \n  \n2.
