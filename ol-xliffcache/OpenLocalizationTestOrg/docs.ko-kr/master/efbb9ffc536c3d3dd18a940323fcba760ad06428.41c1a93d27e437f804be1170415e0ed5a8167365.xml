A constraint is an automatic rule, applied to a column or related columns, that determines the course of action when the value of a row is somehow altered. Constraints are enforced when the `System.Data.DataSet.EnforceConstraints` property of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> is **true**. For a code example that shows how to set the `EnforceConstraints` property, see the <xref:System.Data.DataSet.EnforceConstraints%2A> reference topic.  \n  \n There are two kinds of constraints in ADO.NET: the <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint> and the <xref:System.Data.UniqueConstraint>. By default, both constraints are created automatically when you create a relationship between two or more tables by adding a <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> to the **DataSet**. However, you can disable this behavior by specifying **createConstraints** = **false** when creating the relation.  \n  \n## ForeignKeyConstraint  \n A **ForeignKeyConstraint** enforces rules about how updates and deletes to related tables are propagated. For example, if a value in a row of one table is updated or deleted, and that same value is also used in one or more related tables, a **ForeignKeyConstraint** determines what happens in the related tables.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.DeleteRule%2A> and <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.UpdateRule%2A> properties of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** define the action to be taken when the user attempts to delete or update a row in a related table. The following table describes the different settings available for the **DeleteRule** and **UpdateRule** properties of the **ForeignKeyConstraint**.  \n  \n|Rule setting|Description|  \n|------------------|-----------------|  \n|**Cascade**|Delete or update related rows.|  \n|**SetNull**|Set values in related rows to **DBNull**.|  \n|**SetDefault**|Set values in related rows to the default value.|  \n|**None**|Take no action on related rows. This is the default.|  \n  \n A **ForeignKeyConstraint** can restrict, as well as propagate, changes to related columns. Depending on the properties set for the **ForeignKeyConstraint** of a column, if the **EnforceConstraints** property of the **DataSet** is **true**, performing certain operations on the parent row will result in an exception. For example, if the **DeleteRule** property of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** is **None**, a parent row cannot be deleted if it has any child rows.  \n  \n You can create a foreign key constraint between single columns or between an array of columns by using the **ForeignKeyConstraint** constructor. Pass the resulting **ForeignKeyConstraint** object to the **Add** method of the table's **Constraints** property, which is a **ConstraintCollection**. You can also pass constructor arguments to several overloads of the **Add** method of a **ConstraintCollection** to create a **ForeignKeyConstraint**.  \n  \n When creating a **ForeignKeyConstraint**, you can pass the **DeleteRule** and **UpdateRule** values to the constructor as arguments, or you can set them as properties as in the following example (where the **DeleteRule** value is set to **None**).  \n  \n```vb  \nDim custOrderFK As ForeignKeyConstraint = New ForeignKeyConstraint(\"CustOrderFK\", _  \n  custDS.Tables(\"CustTable\").Columns(\"CustomerID\"), _  \n  custDS.Tables(\"OrdersTable\").Columns(\"CustomerID\"))  \ncustOrderFK.DeleteRule = Rule.None    \n' Cannot delete a customer value that has associated existing orders.  \ncustDS.Tables(\"OrdersTable\").Constraints.Add(custOrderFK)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nForeignKeyConstraint custOrderFK = new ForeignKeyConstraint(\"CustOrderFK\",  \n  custDS.Tables[\"CustTable\"].Columns[\"CustomerID\"],   \n  custDS.Tables[\"OrdersTable\"].Columns[\"CustomerID\"]);  \ncustOrderFK.DeleteRule = Rule.None;    \n// Cannot delete a customer value that has associated existing orders.  \ncustDS.Tables[\"OrdersTable\"].Constraints.Add(custOrderFK);  \n```  \n  \n### AcceptRejectRule  \n Changes to rows can be accepted using the **AcceptChanges** method or canceled using the **RejectChanges** method of the **DataSet**, **DataTable**, or **DataRow**. When a **DataSet** contains **ForeignKeyConstraints**, invoking the **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** methods enforces the **AcceptRejectRule**. The **AcceptRejectRule** property of the **ForeignKeyConstraint** determines which action will be taken on the child rows when **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** is called on the parent row.  \n  \n The following table lists the available settings for the **AcceptRejectRule**.  \n  \n|Rule setting|Description|  \n|------------------|-----------------|  \n|**Cascade**|Accept or reject changes to child rows.|  \n|**None**|Take no action on child rows. This is the default.|  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint>, sets several of its properties, including the <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint.AcceptRejectRule%2A>, and adds it to the <xref:System.Data.ConstraintCollection> of a <xref:System.Data.DataTable> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule#1](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule/CS/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule#1](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks Data.AcceptRejectRule/VB/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n## UniqueConstraint  \n The **UniqueConstraint** object, which can be assigned either to a single column or to an array of columns in a **DataTable**, ensures that all data in the specified column or columns is unique per row. You can create a unique constraint for a column or array of columns by using the **UniqueConstraint** constructor. Pass the resulting **UniqueConstraint** object to the **Add** method of the table's **Constraints** property, which is a **ConstraintCollection**. You can also pass constructor arguments to several overloads of the **Add** method of a **ConstraintCollection** to create a **UniqueConstraint**. When creating a **UniqueConstraint** for a column or columns, you can optionally specify whether the column or columns are a primary key.  \n  \n You can also create a unique constraint for a column by setting the **Unique** property of the column to **true**. Alternatively, setting the **Unique** property of a single column to **false** removes any unique constraint that may exist. Defining a column or columns as the primary key for a table will automatically create a unique constraint for the specified column or columns. If you remove a column from the **PrimaryKey** property of a **DataTable**, the **UniqueConstraint** is removed.  \n  \n The following example creates a **UniqueConstraint** for two columns of a **DataTable**.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim custTable As DataTable = custDS.Tables(\"Customers\")  \nDim custUnique As UniqueConstraint = _  \n    New UniqueConstraint(New DataColumn()   {custTable.Columns(\"CustomerID\"), _  \n    custTable.Columns(\"CompanyName\")})  \ncustDS.Tables(\"Customers\").Constraints.Add(custUnique)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataTable custTable = custDS.Tables[\"Customers\"];  \nUniqueConstraint custUnique = new UniqueConstraint(new DataColumn[]   \n    {custTable.Columns[\"CustomerID\"],   \n    custTable.Columns[\"CompanyName\"]});  \ncustDS.Tables[\"Customers\"].Constraints.Add(custUnique);  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Data.DataRelation>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataTable>   \n <xref:System.Data.ForeignKeyConstraint>
