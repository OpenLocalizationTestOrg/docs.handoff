Workflows are now easier to create, execute, and maintain, and implement a host of new functionality. For more information about migrating .NET 3.0 and .NET 3.5 workflow applications to use the latest version, see [Migration Guidance](migration-guidance.md).  \n  \n## Workflow Activity Model  \n The activity is now the base unit of creating a workflow, rather than using the <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.SequentialWorkflowActivity> or <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.StateMachineWorkflowActivity> classes. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity> class provides the base abstraction of workflow behavior. Activity authors can then implement either <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity> for basic custom activity functionality, or <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> for custom activity functionality that uses the breadth of the runtime. <xref:System.Activities.Activity> is a class used by activity authors to express new behaviors declaratively in terms of other <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>, <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity>, <xref:System.Activities.AsyncCodeActivity>, or <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> objects, whether they are custom-developed or included in the [Built-In Activity Library](net-framework-4-5-built-in-activity-library.md).  \n  \n## Rich Composite Activity Options  \n <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> is a powerful new control flow activity that allows authors to model arbitrary loops and conditional branching. <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> provides an event-driven programming model that was previously only able to be implemented with <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.StateMachineWorkflowActivity>. Procedural workflows benefit from new flow-control activities that model traditional flow-control structures, such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>.  \n  \n## Expanded Built-In Activity Library  \n New features of the activity library include:  \n  \n-   New flow control activities, such as, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601>.  \n  \n-   Activities for manipulating member data, such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> and collection activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.AddToCollection%601>.  \n  \n-   Activities for controlling transactions, such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Compensate>.  \n  \n-   New messaging activities such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendContent> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply>.  \n  \n## Explicit Activity Data Model  \n [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] includes new options for storing or moving data. Data can be stored in an activity using <xref:System.Activities.Variable>. When moving data in and out of an activity, specialized argument types are used to determine which direction data is moving. These types are <xref:System.Activities.InArgument>, <xref:System.Activities.InOutArgument>, and <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument>. For more information, see [Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model](data-model.md).  \n  \n## Enhanced Hosting, Persistence, and Tracking Options  \n [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] contains persistence enhancements such as the following:  \n  \n-   There are more options for running workflows, including <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>, and <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>.  \n  \n-   Workflow state data can be explicitly persisted using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Persist> activity.  \n  \n-   A host can persist an <xref:System.Activities.ActivityInstance> without unloading it.  \n  \n-   A workflow can specify no-persist zones while working with data that cannot be persisted, so that persistence is postponed until the no-persist zone exits.  \n  \n-   Transactions can be flowed into a workflow using <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope>.  \n  \n-   Tracking is more easily accomplished using <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant>.  \n  \n-   Tracking to the system event log is provided using <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant>.  \n  \n-   Resuming a pending workflow is now managed using a <xref:System.Activities.Bookmark> object.  \n  \n## Easier Ability to Extend WF Designer Experience  \n The new WF Designer is built on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and provides an easier model to use when rehosting the WF Designer outside of Visual Studio and also provides easier mechanisms for creating custom activity designers. For more information, see [Customizing the Workflow Design Experience](customizing-the-workflow-design-experience.md).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,224],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title:
