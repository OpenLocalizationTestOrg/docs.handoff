Starting calls the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method on the service class. Usually, the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method defines the useful work the service will perform. After a service starts, it remains active until it is manually paused or stopped.  \n  \n Services can be set up to start automatically or manually. A service that starts automatically will be started when the computer on which it is installed is rebooted or first turned on. A user must start a service that starts manually.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  By default, services created with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] are set to start manually.  \n  \n There are several ways you can manually start a service — from **Server Explorer**, from the **Services Control Manager**, or from code using a component called the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController>.  \n  \n You set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.StartType%2A> property on the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> class to determine whether a service should be started manually or automatically.  \n  \n### To specify how a service should start  \n  \n1.  After creating your service, add the necessary installers for it. For more information, see [How to: Add Installers to Your Service Application](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-add-installers-to-your-service-application.md).  \n  \n2.  In the designer, click the service installer for the service you are working with.  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.StartType%2A> property to one of the following:  \n  \n    |To have your service install|Set this value|  \n    |----------------------------------|--------------------|  \n    |When the computer is restarted|**Automatic**|  \n    |When an explicit user action starts the service|**Manual**|  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  To prevent your service from being started at all, you can set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.StartType%2A> property to **Disabled**. You might do this if you are going to reboot a server several times and want to save time by preventing the services that would normally start from starting up.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  These and other properties can be changed after your service is installed.  \n  \n     There are several ways you can start a service that has its <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller.StartType%2A> process set to **Manual** — from **Server Explorer**, from the **Windows Services Control Manager**, or from code. It is important to note that not all of these methods actually start the service in the context of the **Services Control Manager**; **Server Explorer** and programmatic methods of starting the service actually manipulate the controller.  \n  \n### To manually start a service from Server Explorer  \n  \n1.  In **Server Explorer**, add the server you want if it is not already listed. For more information, see How to: Access and Initialize Server Explorer-Database Explorer.  \n  \n2.  Expand the **Services** node, and then locate the service you want to start.  \n  \n3.  Right-click the name of the service, and click **Start**.  \n  \n### To manually start a service from Services Control Manager  \n  \n1.  Open the **Services Control Manager** by doing one of the following:  \n  \n    -   In Windows XP and 2000 Professional, right-click **My Computer** on the desktop, and then click **Manage**. In the dialog box that appears, expand the **Services and Applications** node.  \n  \n         \\- or -  \n  \n    -   In Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 Server, click **Start**, point to **Programs**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Services**.  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  In Windows NT version 4.0, you can open this dialog box from **Control Panel**.  \n  \n     You should now see your service listed in the **Services** section of the window.  \n  \n2.  Select your service in the list, right-click it, and then click **Start**.  \n  \n### To manually start a service from code  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController> class, and configure it to interact with the service you want to administer.  \n  \n2.  Call the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController.Start%2A> method to start the service.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to Windows Service
