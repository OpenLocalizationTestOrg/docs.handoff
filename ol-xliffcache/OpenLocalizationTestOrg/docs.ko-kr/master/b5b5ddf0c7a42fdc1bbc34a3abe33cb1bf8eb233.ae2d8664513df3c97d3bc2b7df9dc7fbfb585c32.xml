In many scenarios, this unique identifier is used by XAML localization processes and tools.  \n  \n## XAML Attribute Usage  \n  \n```  \n<object x:Uid=\"identifier\"... />  \n```  \n  \n## XAML Values  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|`identifier`|A manually created or autogenerated string that should be unique in a file when it is interpreted by an `x:Uid` consumer.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n In [MS-XAML], `x:Uid` is defined as a directive. For more information, see [\\[MS-XAML\\] Section 5.3.6](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525).  \n  \n `x:Uid` is discrete from `x:Name` both because of the stated XAML localization scenario and so that identifiers that are used for localization have no dependencies on the programming model implications of `x:Name`. Also, `x:Name` is governed by the XAML namescope; however, `x:Uid` is not governed by any XAML language defined concept of uniqueness enforcement. XAML processors in a broad sense (processors that are not part of the localization process) are not expected to enforce uniqueness of `x:Uid` values. That responsibility is conceptually on the originator of the values. The expectation of uniqueness of `x:Uid` values within a single XAML source is reasonable for consumers of the values, such as dedicated globalization processes or tools. The typical uniqueness model is that `x:Uid` values are unique within an XML-encoded file that represents XAML.  \n  \n Tools that have significant knowledge of a particular XAML schema can choose to apply `x:Uid` only for true localizable strings, instead of for all cases where a text string value is encountered in markup.  \n  \n Frameworks can specify a particular property in their object model to be an alias for `x:Uid` by applying the attribute <xref:System.Windows.Markup.UidPropertyAttribute> to the defining type. If a framework specifies a particular property, it is not valid to specify both `x:Uid` and the aliased member on the same object. If both `x:Uid` and the aliased member are specified, the .NET Framework XAML Services API typically throws <xref:System.Xaml.XamlDuplicateMemberException> for this case.  \n  \n## WPF Usage Notes  \n For more information about the role of `x:Uid` in the WPF localization process and in the BAML form of XAML, see [Globalization for WPF](../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/globalization-for-wpf.md) or <xref:System.Windows.Markup.Localizer.BamlLocalizableResourceKey.Uid%2A>  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Markup.Localizer.BamlLocalizableResourceKey.Uid%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Windows.UidManager>   \n [Globalization for WPF](../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/globalization-for-wpf.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,44],"content":"x:Uid Directive | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"x:Uid Directive | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,32]}]},{"pos":[550,565],"content":"x:Uid Directive","linkify":"x:Uid Directive","nodes":[{"content":"x:Uid Directive","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Provides a unique identifier for markup elements.","pos":[566,615]},{"content":"In many scenarios, this unique identifier is used by XAML localization processes and tools.","pos":[616,707]},{"pos":[716,736],"content":"XAML Attribute Usage","linkify":"XAML Attribute Usage","nodes":[{"content":"XAML Attribute Usage","pos":[0,20]}]},{"pos":[795,806],"content":"XAML Values","linkify":"XAML Values","nodes":[{"content":"XAML Values","pos":[0,11]}]},{"pos":[840,961],"content":"A manually created or autogenerated string that should be unique in a file when it is interpreted by an <ph id=\"ph1\">`x:Uid`</ph> consumer.","source":"A manually created or autogenerated string that should be unique in a file when it is interpreted by an `x:Uid` consumer."},{"pos":[971,978],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In [MS-XAML], <ph id=\"ph1\">`x:Uid`</ph> is defined as a directive.","pos":[982,1030],"source":"In [MS-XAML], `x:Uid` is defined as a directive."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\[</ph>MS-XAML<ph id=\"ph2\">\\]</ph> Section 5.3.6<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525)</ept>.","pos":[1031,1132],"source":" For more information, see [\\[MS-XAML\\] Section 5.3.6](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=114525)."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`x:Uid`</ph> is discrete from <ph id=\"ph2\">`x:Name`</ph> both because of the stated XAML localization scenario and so that identifiers that are used for localization have no dependencies on the programming model implications of <ph id=\"ph3\">`x:Name`</ph>.","pos":[1139,1353],"source":"`x:Uid` is discrete from `x:Name` both because of the stated XAML localization scenario and so that identifiers that are used for localization have no dependencies on the programming model implications of `x:Name`."},{"content":"Also, <ph id=\"ph1\">`x:Name`</ph> is governed by the XAML namescope;
