In data parallel operations, the source collection is partitioned so that multiple threads can operate on different segments concurrently.  \n  \n The Task Parallel Library (TPL) supports data parallelism through the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel?displayProperty=fullName> class. This class provides method-based parallel implementations of [for](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/for.md) and [foreach](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in.md) loops (`For` and `For Each` in Visual Basic). You write the loop logic for a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> loop much as you would write a sequential loop. You do not have to create threads or queue work items. In basic loops, you do not have to take locks. The TPL handles all the low-level work for you. For in-depth information about the use of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, download the document [Patterns for Parallel Programming: Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET Framework 4](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=19222). The following code example shows a simple `foreach` loop and its parallel equivalent.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This documentation uses lambda expressions to define delegates in TPL. If you are not familiar with lambda expressions in C# or Visual Basic, see [Lambda Expressions in PLINQ and TPL](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/lambda-expressions-in-plinq-and-tpl.md).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPL#20](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/cs/tpl.cs#20)]\n [!code-vb[TPL#20](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/vb/tpl_vb.vb#20)]  \n  \n When a parallel loop runs, the TPL partitions the data source so that the loop can operate on multiple parts concurrently. Behind the scenes, the Task Scheduler partitions the task based on system resources and workload. When possible, the scheduler redistributes work among multiple threads and processors if the workload becomes unbalanced.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can also supply your own custom partitioner or scheduler. For more information, see [Custom Partitioners for PLINQ and TPL](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/custom-partitioners-for-plinq-and-tpl.md) and [Task Schedulers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/638f8ea5-21db-47a2-a934-86e1e961bf65).  \n  \n Both the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.For%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods have several overloads that let you stop or break loop execution, monitor the state of the loop on other threads, maintain thread-local state, finalize thread-local objects, control the degree of concurrency, and so on. The helper types that enable this functionality include <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopState>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelOptions>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.ParallelLoopResult>, <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken>, and <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource>.  \n  \n For more information, see [Patterns of Parallel Programming](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=265491).  \n  \n Data parallelism with declarative, or query-like, syntax is supported by PLINQ. For more information, see [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md).  \n  \n## Related Topics  \n  \n|Title|Description|
