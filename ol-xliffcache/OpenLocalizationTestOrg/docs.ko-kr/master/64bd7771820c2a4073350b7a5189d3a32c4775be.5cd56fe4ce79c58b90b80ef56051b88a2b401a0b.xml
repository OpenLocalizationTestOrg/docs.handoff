Re-implementation of \\<type> assumed\nA property, procedure, or event in a derived class uses an `Implements` clause specifying an interface member that is already implemented in the base class.  \n  \n A derived class can reimplement an interface member that is implemented by its base class. This is not the same as overriding the base class implementation. For more information, see [Implements](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-clause.md).  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42015  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you intend to reimplement the interface member, you do not need to take any action. Code in your derived class accesses the reimplemented member unless you use the `MyBase` keyword to access the base class implementation.  \n  \n-   If you do not intend to reimplement the interface member, remove the `Implements` clause from the property, procedure, or event declaration.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Interfaces](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,287],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<interfacename>.<membername>' is already implemented by the base class '<baseclassname>'.
