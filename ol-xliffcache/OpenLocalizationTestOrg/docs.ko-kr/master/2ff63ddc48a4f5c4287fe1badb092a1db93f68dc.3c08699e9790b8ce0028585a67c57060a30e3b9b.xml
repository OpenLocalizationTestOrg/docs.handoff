The option is disabled by default. Use **-highentropyva+** or **-highentropyva** to enable it.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **-highentropyva** option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR. Using higher degrees of entropy means that a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps. As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.  \n  \n When the **-highentropyva** compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,300],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"/highentropyva\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"/highentropyva compiler option [C#]\"\n  - \"-highentropyva compiler option [C#]\"\n  - \"highentropyva compiler option [C#]\"\nms.assetid: eaf409b3-384e-49dd-9417-62453658f421","nodes":[{"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[307,343],"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","linkify":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[344,504],"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>-highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> compiler option tells the Windows kernel whether a particular executable supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).","source":"The **-highentropyva** compiler option tells the Windows kernel whether a particular executable supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)."},{"pos":[513,519],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[574,583],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> &amp;#124; <ph id=\"ph2\">`-`</ph>","pos":[587,601],"source":"`+` &#124; `-`"},{"content":"This option specifies that a 64-bit executable or an executable that is marked by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>-platform:anycpu<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/platform-compiler-option.md)</ept> compiler option supports a high entropy virtual address space.","pos":[605,853],"source":"This option specifies that a 64-bit executable or an executable that is marked by the [-platform:anycpu](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/platform-compiler-option.md) compiler option supports a high entropy virtual address space."},{"content":"The option is disabled by default.","pos":[854,888]},{"content":"Use <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>-highentropyva+<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>-highentropyva<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to enable it.","pos":[889,948],"source":" Use **-highentropyva+** or **-highentropyva** to enable it."},{"pos":[957,964],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>-highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR.","pos":[968,1152],"source":"The **-highentropyva** option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR."},{"content":"Using higher degrees of entropy means that a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps.","pos":[1153,1285]},{"content":"As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.","pos":[1286,1372]},{"pos":[1379,1612],"content":"When the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>-highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process.","source":"When the **-highentropyva** compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process."}]}
