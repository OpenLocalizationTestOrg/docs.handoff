SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,118],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 9840fc0a-0e4d-4638-96fd-40e3ab9e4667","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[0,34]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[125,159],"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","linkify":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted Per Second.","pos":[160,199]},{"pos":[208,219],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls that have returned faults to this endpoint in a second.","pos":[223,294]},{"pos":[301,470],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula.","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula."},{"content":"(N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","pos":[477,510]},{"content":"In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[517,656]},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[657,855]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[856,942]},{"pos":[951,959],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[963,1116],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
