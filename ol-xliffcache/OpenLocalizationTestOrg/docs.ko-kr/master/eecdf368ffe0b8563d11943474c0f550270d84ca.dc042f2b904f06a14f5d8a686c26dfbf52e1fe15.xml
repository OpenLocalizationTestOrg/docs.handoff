Some languages provide built-in support for static classes. In C# 2.0 and later, when a class is declared to be static, it is sealed, abstract, and no instance members can be overridden or declared.  \n  \n Static classes are a compromise between pure object-oriented design and simplicity. They are commonly used to provide shortcuts to other operations (such as <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName>), holders of extension methods, or functionality for which a full object-oriented wrapper is unwarranted (such as <xref:System.Environment?displayProperty=fullName>).  \n  \n **✓ DO** use static classes sparingly.  \n  \n Static classes should be used only as supporting classes for the object-oriented core of the framework.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** treat static classes as a miscellaneous bucket.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** declare or override instance members in static classes.  \n  \n **✓ DO** declare static classes as sealed, abstract, and add a private instance constructor if your programming language does not have built-in support for static classes.  \n  \n *Portions © 2005, 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
