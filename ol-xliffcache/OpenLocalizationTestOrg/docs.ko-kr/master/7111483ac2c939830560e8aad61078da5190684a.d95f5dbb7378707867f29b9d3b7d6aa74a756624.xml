For more information and examples, see [Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md), and [Indexers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/indexers/index.md).  \n  \nThe following example defines both a `get` and a `set` accessor for a property named `Seconds`. It uses a private field named `_seconds` to back the property value.  \n \n [!code-cs[set#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-1.cs)]  \n\nOften, the `set` accessor consists of a single statement that returns a value, as it did in the previous example. Starting with C# 7, you can implement the `set` accessor as an expression-bodied member. The following example implements both the `get` and the `set` accessors as expression-bodied members.\n\n [!code-cs[set#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-3.cs)]   \n    \nFor simple cases in which a property's `get` and `set` accessors perform no other operation than setting or retrieving a value in a private backing field, you can take advantage of the C# compiler's support for auto-implemented properties. The following example implements `Hours` as an auto-implemented property. \n  \n [!code-cs[set#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-2.cs)]  \n    \n## C# Language
