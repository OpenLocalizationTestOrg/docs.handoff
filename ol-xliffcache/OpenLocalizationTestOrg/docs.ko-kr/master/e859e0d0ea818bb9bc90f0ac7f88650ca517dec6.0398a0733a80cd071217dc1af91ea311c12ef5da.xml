All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \nexpression EXCEPT expression  \n```  \n  \n## Arguments  \n `expression`  \n Any valid query expression that returns a collection to compare with the collection returned from another query expression.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n EXCEPT is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. The following table shows the precedence of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators.  \n  \n|Precedence|Operators|  \n|----------------|---------------|  \n|Highest|INTERSECT|  \n||UNION<br /><br /> UNION ALL|  \n||EXCEPT|  \n|Lowest|EXISTS<br /><br /> OVERLAPS<br /><br /> FLATTEN<br /><br /> SET|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses the EXCEPT operator to return a collection of any distinct values from two query expressions.
