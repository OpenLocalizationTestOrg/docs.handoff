Functional construction is the ability to create an XML tree in a single statement.  \n  \n There are several key features of the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] programming interface that enable functional construction:  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> constructor takes various types of arguments for content. For example, you can pass another <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object, which becomes a child element. You can pass an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> object, which becomes an attribute of the element. Or you can pass any other type of object, which is converted to a string and becomes the text content of the element.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> constructor takes a `params` array of type <xref:System.Object>, so that you can pass any number of objects to the constructor. This enables you to create an element that has complex content.  \n  \n-   If an object implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, the collection in the object is enumerated, and all items in the collection are added. If the collection contains <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> or <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute> objects, each item in the collection is added separately. This is important because it lets you pass the results of a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query to the constructor.  \n  \n The following is an example:  \n  \n These features enable you to write code using XML literals to create an XML tree, and also to write code that uses the results of [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] queries when you create an XML tree:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim srcTree As XElement = _  \n    <Root>  \n        <Element>1</Element>  \n        <Element>2</Element>  \n        <Element>3</Element>  \n        <Element>4</Element>  \n        <Element>5</Element>  \n    </Root>  \nDim xmlTree As XElement = _  \n    <Root>  \n        <Child>1</Child>  \n        <Child>2</Child>  \n        <%= From el In srcTree.Elements() _  \n            Where CInt(el) > 2 _  \n            Select el %>  \n    </Root>  \nConsole.WriteLine(xmlTree)  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Root>  \n  <Child>1</Child>  \n  <Child>2</Child>  \n  <Element>3</Element>  \n  <Element>4</Element>  \n  <Element>5</Element>  \n</Root>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating XML
