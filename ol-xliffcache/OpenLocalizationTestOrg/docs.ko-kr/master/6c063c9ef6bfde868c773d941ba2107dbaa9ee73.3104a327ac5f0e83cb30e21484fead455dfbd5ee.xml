Add the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) to your project and configure your project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n2.  In the code page for your application, add the following `using` statements (`Imports` in Visual Basic):  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/cs/source.cs#namespaces)]\n     [!code-vb[DP EntityServices Concepts#Namespaces](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts/vb/source.vb#namespaces)]  \n  \n3.  Double click the .edmx file to display the model in the [Model Browser window](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738483(v=vs.100)) of the Entity Designer. On the Entity Designer surface, select the `Email` and `Phone` properties of the `Contact` entity type, then right-click and select **Refactor into New Complex Type**.  \n  \n4.  A new complex type with the selected `Email` and `Phone` properties is added to the **Model Browser**. The complex type is given a default name: rename the type to `EmailPhone` in the **Properties** window. Also, a new `ComplexProperty` property is added to the `Contact` entity type. Rename the property to `EmailPhoneComplexType.`  \n  \n     For information about creating and modifying complex types by using the Entity Data Model Wizard, see [How to: Refactor Existing Properties into a Complex Type Property](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd456814(v=vs.100)) and [How to: Create and Modify Complex Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd456820(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example executes a query that returns a collection of `Contact` objects and displays two properties of the `Contact` objects: `ContactID` and the values of the `EmailPhoneComplexType` complex type.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices
