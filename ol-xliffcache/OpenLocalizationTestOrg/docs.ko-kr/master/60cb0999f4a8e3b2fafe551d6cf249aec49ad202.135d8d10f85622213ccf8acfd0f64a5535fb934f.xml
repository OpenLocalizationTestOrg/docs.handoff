The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> property will convert <xref:System.DBNull> to a specified object when formatting or parsing the data source values.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.DBNull> value in two different situations. The first demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> for a string property; the second demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> for an image property.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n The types of the bound property and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> property must be the same or an error will result, and no further <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> values will be processed. In this situation, an exception will not be thrown.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
