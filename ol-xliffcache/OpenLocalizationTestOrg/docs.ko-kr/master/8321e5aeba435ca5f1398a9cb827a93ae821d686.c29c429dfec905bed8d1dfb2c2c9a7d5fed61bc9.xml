See the Remarks section for the distinction between catch-up and non-catch-up events.|  \n|`CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_DEBUGGER_LAUNCH`|The managed event that is pending is a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> request.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Catch-up events include process, application domain, assembly, module, and thread creation notifications that bring the debugger up to the current state after it has attached to a process. Non-catch-up events, which are indicated by the `CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_PENDING` flag, include all other debugger events, such as exceptions and managed debugging assistant (MDA) notifications.  \n  \n The `CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_DEBUGGER_LAUNCH` flag enables the runtime to differentiate between a terminating exception and a request to attach a managed debugger that can be canceled.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** Metahost.idl, Metahost.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v40plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v40plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Debugging Enumerations](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/debugging-enumerations.md)\n- [Debugging](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,431],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"CLR_DEBUGGING_PROCESS_FLAGS Enumeration\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  -
