When code needs to make role-based validations only once, you can create a <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object by using the second of the following procedures.  \n  \n### To create a WindowsPrincipal object for repeated validation  \n  \n1.  Call the <xref:System.AppDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy%2A> method on the <xref:System.AppDomain> object that is returned by the static <xref:System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property, passing the method a <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy> enumeration value that indicates what the new policy should be. Supported values are <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.NoPrincipal>, <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.UnauthenticatedPrincipal>, and <xref:System.Security.Principal.PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal>. The following code demonstrates this method call.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy(  \n        PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetPrincipalPolicy( _  \n        PrincipalPolicy.WindowsPrincipal)  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  With the policy set, use the static <xref:System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to retrieve the principal that encapsulates the current Windows user. Because the property return type is <xref:System.Security.Principal.IPrincipal>, you must cast the result to a <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> type. The following code initializes a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object to the value of the principal associated with the current thread.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    WindowsPrincipal myPrincipal =   \n        (WindowsPrincipal) Thread.CurrentPrincipal;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myPrincipal As WindowsPrincipal = _  \n        CType(Thread.CurrentPrincipal, WindowsPrincipal)   \n    ```  \n  \n3.  When the principal object has been created, you can use one of several methods to validate it.  \n  \n### To create a WindowsPrincipal object for a single validation  \n  \n1.  Initialize a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object by calling the static <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which queries the current Windows account and places information about that account into the newly created identity object. The following code creates a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object and initializes it to the current authenticated user.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    WindowsIdentity myIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent();  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myIdentity As WindowsIdentity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Create a new <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal> object and pass it the value of the <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> object created in the preceding step.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    WindowsPrincipal myPrincipal = new WindowsPrincipal(myIdentity);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myPrincipal As New WindowsPrincipal(myIdentity)  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  When the principal object has been created, you can use one of several methods to validate it.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Principal and Identity
