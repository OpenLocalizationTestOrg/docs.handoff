There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40033  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you require CLS compliance and have control over the interface source code, mark the interface as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` if all its members are compliant.  \n  \n-   If you require CLS compliance and do not have control over the interface source code, or if it does not qualify to be compliant, define this member within a different interface.  \n  \n-   If you require that this member remain within its current interface, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Interface Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/interface-statement.md)   \n [\\<PAVE OVER> Writing CLS-Compliant Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4c705105-69a2-4e5e-b24e-0633bc32c7f3)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,109],"content":"Non-CLS-compliant &lt;membername&gt;
