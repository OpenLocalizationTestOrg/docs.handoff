An interpolated string is a template-like string that contains literal text along with *interpolated expressions*. When the interpolated string is resolved, for example in an assignment statement or a method call, its interpolated expressions are replaced by their string representations in the result string. Interpolated strings are replacements for the [composite format strings](../../../standard/base-types/composite-format.md) supported by the .NET Framework.\n\nThe following example uses the `$` character to define an interpolated string.\n\n[!CODE-vb[interpolated-string-symbol](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/language-reference/special-characters/dollar-sign1.vb)]\n\nFor more information on interpolated strings, see the [Interpolated Strings](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md) topic.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Reference](../index.md)\n- [Visual Basic Special Characters](index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,59],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"$ (Visual Basic Reference)\"\nms.date: 10/31/2017","nodes":[{"content":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,26],"content":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","pos":[0,26]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[66,92],"content":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","linkify":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"$ (Visual Basic Reference)","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Identifies a string literal as an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>interpolated string<ept id=\"p1\">](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md)</ept>.","pos":[94,225],"source":"Identifies a string literal as an [interpolated string](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md)."},{"content":"An interpolated string is a template-like string that contains literal text along with <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>interpolated expressions<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[226,340],"source":" An interpolated string is a template-like string that contains literal text along with *interpolated expressions*."},{"content":"When the interpolated string is resolved, for example in an assignment statement or a method call, its interpolated expressions are replaced by their string representations in the result string.","pos":[341,535]},{"content":"Interpolated strings are replacements for the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>composite format strings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../standard/base-types/composite-format.md)</ept> supported by the .NET Framework.","pos":[536,691],"source":" Interpolated strings are replacements for the [composite format strings](../../../standard/base-types/composite-format.md) supported by the .NET Framework."},{"pos":[693,771],"content":"The following example uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">`$`</ph> character to define an interpolated string.","source":"The following example uses the `$` character to define an interpolated string."},{"pos":[909,1067],"content":"For more information on interpolated strings, see the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Interpolated Strings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md)</ept> topic.","source":"For more information on interpolated strings, see the [Interpolated Strings](../../programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings.md) topic."},{"pos":[1072,1080],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1084,1121],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../index.md)</ept>","source":"[Visual Basic Reference](../index.md)"},{"pos":[1124,1167],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Special Characters<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Visual Basic Special Characters](index.md)"}]}
