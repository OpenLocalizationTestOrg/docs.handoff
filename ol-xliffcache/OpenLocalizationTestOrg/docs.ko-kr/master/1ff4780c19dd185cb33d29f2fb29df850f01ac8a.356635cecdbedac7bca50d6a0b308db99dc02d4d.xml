You probably meant to say `if (a == a)`, which is always true, so you could write this more concisely as `if (true)`.  \n  \n-   Mistyping. You probably meant to say `a = b`.  \n  \n-   In a constructor where the parameter has the same name as the field, not using the **this** keyword: you probably meant to say `this.a = a`.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS1717.  \n  \n```  \n// CS1717.cs  \n// compile with: /W:3  \npublic class Test  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n      int x = 0;  \n      x = x;   // CS1717  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[578,611],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1717","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Assignment made to same variable; did you mean to assign something else?","pos":[612,684]},{"pos":[691,765],"content":"This warning occurs when you assign a variable to itself, such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`a = a`</ph>.","source":"This warning occurs when you assign a variable to itself, such as `a = a`."},{"content":"Several common mistakes can generate this warning:","pos":[772,822]},{"content":"Writing <ph id=\"ph1\">`a = a`</ph> as the condition of an <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>if<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> statement, such as <ph id=\"ph2\">`if (a = a)`</ph>.","pos":[832,910],"source":"Writing `a = a` as the condition of an **if** statement, such as `if (a = a)`."},{"content":"You probably meant to say <ph id=\"ph1\">`if (a == a)`</ph>, which is always true, so you could write this more concisely as <ph id=\"ph2\">`if (true)`</ph>.","pos":[911,1028],"source":" You probably meant to say `if (a == a)`, which is always true, so you could write this more concisely as `if (true)`."},{"content":"Mistyping.","pos":[1038,1048]},{"content":"You probably meant to say <ph id=\"ph1\">`a = b`</ph>.","pos":[1049,1083],"source":" You probably meant to say `a = b`."},{"pos":[1093,1233],"content":"In a constructor where the parameter has the same name as the field, not using the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>this<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> keyword: you probably meant to say <ph id=\"ph1\">`this.a = a`</ph>.","source":"In a constructor where the parameter has the same name as the field, not using the **this** keyword: you probably meant to say `this.a = a`."},{"pos":[1242,1249],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1717.","pos":[1253,1291]}]}
