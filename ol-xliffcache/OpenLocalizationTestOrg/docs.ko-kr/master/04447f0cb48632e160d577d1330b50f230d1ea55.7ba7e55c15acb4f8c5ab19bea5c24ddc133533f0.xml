In This Section  \n [How to: Query for Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-query-for-information.md)  \n Briefly shows how [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] queries are basically the same as [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries generally.  \n  \n [How to: Retrieve Information As Read-Only](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-retrieve-information-as-read-only.md)  \n Describes how to increase query performance when no change to the data is planned.  \n  \n [How to: Control How Much Related Data Is Retrieved](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-control-how-much-related-data-is-retrieved.md)  \n Describes how to control which related data is retrieved together with the main target.  \n  \n [How to: Filter Related Data](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-filter-related-data.md)  \n Describes how to retrieve related data by using a sub-query.  \n  \n [How to: Turn Off Deferred Loading](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-turn-off-deferred-loading.md)  \n Describes how to turn off deferred loading.  \n  \n [How to: Directly Execute SQL Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-directly-execute-sql-queries.md)  \n Describes how to submit queries by using SQL language.  \n  \n [How to: Store and Reuse Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-store-and-reuse-queries.md)  \n Describes how to compile a query one time but use it multiple times with different parameters.  \n  \n [How to: Handle Composite Keys in Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-handle-composite-keys-in-queries.md)  \n Describes how to include more than one column in a query where the operator takes only a single argument.  \n  \n [How to: Retrieve Many Objects At Once](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-retrieve-many-objects-at-once.md)  \n Describes how to use <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataLoadOptions.LoadWith%2A>.  \n  \n [How to: Filter at the DataContext Level](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-filter-at-the-datacontext-level.md)  \n Describes another use of <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataLoadOptions.LoadWith%2A>.  \n  \n [Query Examples](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/query-examples.md)  \n Provides many examples of queries.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Querying the Database | Microsoft
