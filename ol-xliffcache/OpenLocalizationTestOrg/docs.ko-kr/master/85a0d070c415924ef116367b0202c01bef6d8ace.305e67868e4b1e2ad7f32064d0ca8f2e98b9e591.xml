This places all XML properties in the default namespace. No other modifications are required to the example to make it work properly.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports <xmlns=\"http://www.adventure-works.com\">  \n  \nModule Module1  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim root As XElement = _  \n            <Root xmlns='http://www.adventure-works.com'>  \n                <Child>1</Child>  \n                <Child>2</Child>  \n                <Child>3</Child>  \n                <AnotherChild>4</AnotherChild>  \n                <AnotherChild>5</AnotherChild>  \n                <AnotherChild>6</AnotherChild>  \n            </Root>  \n        Dim c1 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = _  \n                From el In root.<Child> _  \n                Select el  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Result set follows:\")  \n        For Each el As XElement In c1  \n            Console.WriteLine(CInt(el))  \n        Next  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"End of result set\")  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following result:  \n  \n```  \nResult set follows:  \n1  \n2  \n3  \nEnd of result set  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Basic Queries (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-queries-linq-to-xml.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,82],"content":"How to: Debug Empty Query Results Sets (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Debug Empty Query Results Sets (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,70]}]},{"pos":[389,442],"content":"How to: Debug Empty Query Results Sets (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Debug Empty Query Results Sets (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Debug Empty Query Results Sets (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"One of the most common problems when querying XML trees is that if the XML tree has a default namespace, the developer sometimes writes the query as though the XML were not in a namespace.","pos":[443,631]},{"content":"The first set of examples in this topic shows a typical way that XML in a default namespace is loaded, and is queried improperly.","pos":[638,767]},{"content":"The second set of examples show the necessary corrections so that you can query XML in a namespace.","pos":[774,873]},{"pos":[880,1040],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Working with XML Namespaces (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/working-with-xml-namespaces.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [Working with XML Namespaces (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/working-with-xml-namespaces.md)."},{"pos":[1049,1056],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This example shows creation of XML in a namespace, and a query that returns an empty result set.","pos":[1060,1156]},{"content":"This example produces the following result:","pos":[1731,1774]},{"pos":[1840,1847],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This example shows creation of XML in a namespace, and a query that is coded properly.","pos":[1851,1937]},{"content":"The solution is to declare and initialize a global default namespace.","pos":[1944,2013]},{"content":"This places all XML properties in the default namespace.","pos":[2014,2070]},{"content":"No other modifications are required to the example to make it work properly.","pos":[2071,2147]},{"content":"This example produces the following result:","pos":[2973,3016]},{"pos":[3094,3102],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[3106,3237],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Basic Queries (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-queries-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Basic Queries (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-queries-linq-to-xml.md)"}]}
