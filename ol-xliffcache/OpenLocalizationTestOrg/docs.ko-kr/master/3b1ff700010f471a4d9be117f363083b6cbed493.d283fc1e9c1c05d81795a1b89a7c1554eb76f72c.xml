Most security scenarios can be satisfied using common credential types, such as Windows (Kerberos), username and passwords, and certificates. However, if a new type of credential is required, the topics in this section explain how to handle and validate new types.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Create a Service that Employs a Custom Certificate Validator](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-service-that-employs-a-custom-certificate-validator.md)  \n Explains how to customize WCF validation by inheriting from the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.X509CertificateValidator> class.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Creating Custom Client and Service Credentials](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/walkthrough-creating-custom-client-and-service-credentials.md)  \n Demonstrates how to extend the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ClientCredentials> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceCredentials> classes to accommodate new credential types. This is first in a series of topics that enable creation of custom credential types.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Custom Security Token Provider](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-security-token-provider.md)  \n Explains how to create a security token provider to handle new credential types and return new tokens for the credential. This is the second topic in the series.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Custom Security Token Authenticator](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-security-token-authenticator.md)  \n Explains how to create a custom authenticator to authenticate a new credential type. This is the third topic in the series.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security>  \n  \n <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims>  \n  \n <xref:System.IdentityModel.Policy>  \n  \n
