With [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] you can create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images as objects. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is designed to offer performance and ease of use. You can use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] to render graphical images on Windows Forms and controls. Although you cannot use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] directly on Web Forms, you can display graphical images through the Image Web Server control.  \n  \n In this section, you will find topics that introduce the fundamentals of [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] programming. Although not intended to be a comprehensive reference, this section includes information about the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>, <xref:System.Drawing.Brush>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Color> objects, and explains how to perform such tasks as drawing shapes, drawing text, or displaying images.
