One of these features, called `My`, provides access to information and default object instances that are related to the application and its run-time environment. This information is organized in a format that is discoverable through IntelliSense and logically delineated according to use.  \n  \n Top-level members of `My` are exposed as objects. Each object behaves similarly to a namespace or a class with `Shared` members, and it exposes a set of related members.  \n  \n This table shows the top-level `My` objects and their relationship to each other.  \n  \n ![Diagram shows the object model for My.](./media/index/my-object-model-relationships.gif)  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Performing Tasks with My.Application, My.Computer, and
