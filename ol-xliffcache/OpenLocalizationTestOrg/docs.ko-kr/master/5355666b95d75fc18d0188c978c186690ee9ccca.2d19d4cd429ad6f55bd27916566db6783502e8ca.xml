For new development, use the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> class instead of the <xref:System.TimeZone> class.\n\n* <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>\n\n  Use this structure to work with dates and times whose offset (or difference) from UTC is known. The <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> structure combines a date and time value with that time's offset from UTC. Because of its relationship to UTC, an individual date and time value unambiguously identifies a single point in time. This makes a <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> value more portable from one computer to another than a <xref:System.DateTime> value.\n\nThis section of the documentation provides the information that you need to work with time zones and to create time zone-aware applications that can convert dates and times from one time zone to another.\n\n## In this section\n\n[Time zone overview](../../../docs/standard/datetime/time-zone-overview.md)\n Discusses the terminology, concepts, and issues involved in creating time zone-aware applications.\n\n[Choosing between DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and TimeZoneInfo](../../../docs/standard/datetime/choosing-between-datetime.md)\n Discusses when to use the <xref:System.DateTime>, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset>, and <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> types when working with date and time data.\n\n[Finding the time zones defined on a local system](../../../docs/standard/datetime/finding-the-time-zones-on-local-system.md)\n Describes how to enumerate the time zones found on a local system.\n\n[How to: Enumerate time zones present on a computer](../../../docs/standard/datetime/enumerate-time-zones.md)\n Provides examples that enumerate the time zones defined in a computer's registry and that let users select a predefined time zone from a list.\n\n[How to: Access the predefined UTC and local time zone objects](../../../docs/standard/datetime/access-utc-and-local.md)\n Describes how to access Coordinated Universal Time and the local time zone.\n\n[How to: Instantiate a TimeZoneInfo object](../../../docs/standard/datetime/instantiate-time-zone-info.md)\n Describes how to instantiate a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object from the local system registry.\n\n[Instantiating a DateTimeOffset object](../../../docs/standard/datetime/instantiating-a-datetimeoffset-object.md)\n Discusses the ways in which a <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> object can be instantiated, and the ways in which a <xref:System.DateTime> value can be converted to a <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> value.\n\n[How to: Create time zones without adjustment rules](../../../docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-without-adjustment-rules.md)\n Describes how to create a custom time zone that does not support the transition to and from daylight saving time.\n\n[How to: Create time zones with adjustment rules](../../../docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-with-adjustment-rules.md)\n Describes how to create a custom time zone that supports one or more transitions to and from daylight saving time.\n\n[Saving and restoring time zones](../../../docs/standard/datetime/saving-and-restoring-time-zones.md)\n Describes <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> support for serialization and deserialization of time zone data and illustrates some of the scenarios in which these features can be used.\n\n[How to: Save time zones to an embedded resource](../../../docs/standard/datetime/save-time-zones-to-an-embedded-resource.md)\n Describes how to create a custom time zone and save its information in a resource file.\n\n[How to: Restore time zones from an embedded resource](../../../docs/standard/datetime/restore-time-zones-from-an-embedded-resource.md)\n Describes how to instantiate custom time zones that have been saved to an embedded resource file.\n\n[Performing arithmetic operations with dates and times](../../../docs/standard/datetime/performing-arithmetic-operations.md)\n Discusses the issues involved in adding, subtracting, and comparing <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values.\n\n[How to: Use time zones in date and time arithmetic](../../../docs/standard/datetime/use-time-zones-in-arithmetic.md)\n Discusses how to perform date and time arithmetic that reflects a time zone's adjustment rules.\n\n[Converting between DateTime and DateTimeOffset](../../../docs/standard/datetime/converting-between-datetime-and-offset.md)\n Describes how to convert between <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values.\n\n[Converting times between time zones](../../../docs/standard/datetime/converting-between-time-zones.md)\n Describes how to convert times from one time zone to another.\n\n[How to: Resolve ambiguous times](../../../docs/standard/datetime/resolve-ambiguous-times.md)\n Describes how to resolve an ambiguous time by mapping it to the time zone's standard time.\n\n[How to: Let users resolve ambiguous times](../../../docs/standard/datetime/let-users-resolve-ambiguous-times.md)\n Describes how to let a user determine the mapping between an ambiguous local time and Coordinated Universal Time.\n\n## Reference\n\n<xref:System.TimeZoneInfo?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,403],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Dates, times, and time
