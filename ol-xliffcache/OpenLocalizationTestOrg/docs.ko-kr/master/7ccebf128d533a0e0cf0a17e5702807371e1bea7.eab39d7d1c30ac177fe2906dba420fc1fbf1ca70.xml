By writing code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event, you can specify what to print and how to print it.  \n  \n### To create a print job  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  \n  \n2.  Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  \n  \n     You will have to code your own printing logic. Additionally, you will have to specify the material to be printed.  \n  \n     In the following code example, a sample graphic in the shape of a red rectangle is created in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler to act as material to be printed.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500))  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red,   \n         new Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Red,  \n             Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     (Visual C# and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    ```  \n  \n     You may also want to write code for the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.BeginPrint> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> events, perhaps including an integer representing the total number of pages to print that is decremented as each page prints.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component to your form to provide a clean and efficient user interface (UI) to your users. Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog.Document%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component enables you to set properties related to the print document you are working with on your form. For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component, see [PrintDialog Component](../controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n     For more information about the specifics of Windows Forms print jobs, including how to create a print job programmatically, see <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>\n- [Windows Forms Print Support](windows-forms-print-support.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,336],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"printing [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"printing [Windows Forms], creating print jobs\"\n  - \"printing [Visual Basic], in Windows applications\"\nms.assetid: 03342b90-9cfe-40b2-838b-b479a13c5dea","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[343,391],"content":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","linkify":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"The foundation of printing in Windows Forms is the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component—more specifically, the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage&gt;</ph> event.","pos":[392,582],"source":"The foundation of printing in Windows Forms is the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component—more specifically, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event."},{"content":"By writing code to handle the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage&gt;</ph> event, you can specify what to print and how to print it.","pos":[583,725],"source":" By writing code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event, you can specify what to print and how to print it."},{"pos":[735,756],"content":"To create a print job","linkify":"To create a print job","nodes":[{"content":"To create a print job","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[766,840],"content":"Add a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component to your form.","source":"Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form."},{"pos":[850,936],"content":"Write code to handle the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage&gt;</ph> event.","source":"Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event."},{"content":"You will have to code your own printing logic.","pos":[947,993]},{"content":"Additionally, you will have to specify the material to be printed.","pos":[994,1060]},{"pos":[1071,1271],"content":"In the following code example, a sample graphic in the shape of a red rectangle is created in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage&gt;</ph> event handler to act as material to be printed.","source":"In the following code example, a sample graphic in the shape of a red rectangle is created in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler to act as material to be printed."},{"pos":[2100,2251],"content":"(Visual C# and <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]</ph>) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.","source":"(Visual C# and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler."},{"pos":[2607,2886],"content":"You may also want to write code for the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.BeginPrint&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint&gt;</ph> events, perhaps including an integer representing the total number of pages to print that is decremented as each page prints.","source":"You may also want to write code for the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.BeginPrint> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> events, perhaps including an integer representing the total number of pages to print that is decremented as each page prints."},{"pos":[2898,3445],"content":"[!NOTE]\nYou can add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component to your form to provide a clean and efficient user interface (UI) to your users.
