The sample console application creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> instance with a basic workflow definition, and adds a `CreationEndpoint` to the host. It then calls the `Create` operation on the endpoint to create a new workflow instance.  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Build the solution.  \n  \n2.  Run the application. The `CreationEndpoint` console shows a message that includes the instance ID when the workflow instance is created. The message \"Hello World!\" is printed by the workflow on successful resumption of the bookmark.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
