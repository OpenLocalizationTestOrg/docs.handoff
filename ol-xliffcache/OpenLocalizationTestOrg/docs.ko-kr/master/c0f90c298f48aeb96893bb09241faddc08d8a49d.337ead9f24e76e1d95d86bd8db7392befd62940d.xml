To draw lines and curves with a texture, create a <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object, and pass that <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object to a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor. The bitmap associated with the texture brush is used to tile the plane (invisibly), and when the pen draws a line or curve, the stroke of the pen uncovers certain pixels of the tiled texture.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object from the file `Texture1.jpg`. That bitmap is used to construct a <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object, and the <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object is used to construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object. The call to <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> draws the bitmap with its upper-left corner at (0, 0). The call to <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> uses the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object to draw a textured ellipse.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the bitmap and the textured ellipse:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that shows the bitmap and the textured ellipse.](./media/how-to-draw-a-line-filled-with-a-texture/bitmap-textured-ellipse.png)  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#61](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#61)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#61](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#61)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Create a Windows Form and handle the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event. Paste the preceding code into the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler. Replace `Texture.jpg` with an image valid on your system.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)\n- [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,300],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Line Filled with a Texture\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
