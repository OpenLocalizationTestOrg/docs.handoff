If no value is returned, it is implemented as a `Public Sub`. Methods are declared using the following syntax:  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Function ConvertMatterToEnergy(Matter as Integer) As Integer  \n   ' Conversion code goes here.  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n Because functions return a value, they must specify a return type, such as integer, string, object, and so on. The arguments `Function` or `Sub` procedures take, if any, must also be specified.  \n  \n C# makes no distinction between functions and procedures, as Visual Basic does. A method either returns a value or returns `void`. The syntax for declaring a C# public method is:  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic int ConvertMatterToEnergy(int matter)  \n{  \n   // Conversion code goes here.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n When you declare a method, declare all of its arguments as explicit data types whenever possible. Arguments that take object references should be declared as specific class types — for example, `As Widget` instead of `As Object`. In Visual Basic, the default setting `Option Strict` automatically enforces this rule.  \n  \n Typed arguments allow many developer errors to be caught by the compiler, rather than at run time. The compiler always catches errors, whereas run-time testing is only as good as the test suite.  \n  \n## Overloaded Methods  \n If you want to allow users of your control to supply different combinations of parameters to a method, provide multiple overloads of the method, using explicit data types. Avoid creating parameters declared `As Object` that can contain any data type, as this can lead to errors that might not be caught in testing.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The universal data type in the common language runtime is `Object` rather than `Variant`. `Variant` has been removed from the language.  \n  \n For example, the `Spin` method of a hypothetical `Widget` control might allow either direct specification of spin direction and speed, or specification of another `Widget` object from which angular momentum is to be absorbed:  \n  \n```vb  \nOverloads Public Sub Spin( _  \n   ByVal SpinDirection As SpinDirectionsEnum, _  \n   ByVal RevolutionsPerSecond As Double)  \n   ' Implementation code here.  \nEnd Sub  \nOverloads Public Sub Spin(ByVal Driver As Widget) _  \n   ' Implementation code here.  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic void Spin(SpinDirectionsEnum spinDirection, double revolutionsPerSecond)  \n{  \n   // Implementation code here.  \n}  \n  \npublic void Spin(Widget driver)  \n{  \n   // Implementation code here.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Events](../../../standard/events/index.md)\n- [Properties in Windows Forms
