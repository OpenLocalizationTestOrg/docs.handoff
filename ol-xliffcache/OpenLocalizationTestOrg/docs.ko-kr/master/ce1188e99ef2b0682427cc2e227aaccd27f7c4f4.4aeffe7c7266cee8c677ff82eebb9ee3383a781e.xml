The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (`==`) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (`!=`) operator, and finally a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D> structure and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structure are checked for equality using the static <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[3DGallery_procedural_snip#Point4DEqualityExample_csharp](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/3DGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/Misc3DOperationsExample.cs#point4dequalityexample_csharp)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.op_Equality%2A>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.op_Inequality%2A>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,489],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"inequality [WPF], testing Point4D structures for\"\n  - \"equality [WPF], testing Point4D structures for\"\n  - \"testing [WPF], Point4D structures for equality\"\n  - \"Point4D structures [WPF], testing for inequality\"\n  - \"testing [WPF], Point4D structures for inequality\"\n  - \"Point4D structures [WPF], testing for equality\"\nms.assetid: e004a67e-db7f-4af8-a31f-e6b2a44ccf34","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[496,555],"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","linkify":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[556,670],"content":"This example shows how to test <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures for equality and inequality.","source":"This example shows how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality."},{"content":"The following code illustrates how to test <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures for equality and inequality using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> equality methods.","pos":[677,874],"source":"The following code illustrates how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> equality methods."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (<ph id=\"ph2\">`==`</ph>) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (<ph id=\"ph3\">`!=`</ph>) operator, and finally a <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D&gt;</ph> structure and a <ph id=\"ph5\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structure are checked for equality using the static <ph id=\"ph6\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[876,1306],"source":"  The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (`==`) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (`!=`) operator, and finally a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D> structure and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structure are checked for equality using the static <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A> method."},{"pos":[1315,1322],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1539,1547],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
