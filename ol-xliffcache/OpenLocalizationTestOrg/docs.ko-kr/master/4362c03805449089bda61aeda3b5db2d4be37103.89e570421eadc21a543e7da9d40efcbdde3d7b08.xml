The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects (graphics or text) to a device, such as a screen or printer.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> are not supported for printing. You should always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods of <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, as shown in the following code example, to draw text for printing purposes.  \n  \n### To print text  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component and a string to your form.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#8)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#8)]  \n  \n2.  If printing a document, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property to the document you wish to print, and open and read the documents contents to the string you added previously.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n3.  In the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler, use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class and the document contents to calculate line length and lines per page. After each page is drawn, check to see if it is the last page, and set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> accordingly. The <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event is raised until <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.HasMorePages%2A> is `false`. Also, make sure the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event is associated with its event-handling method.  \n  \n     In the following code example, the event handler is used to print the contents of the \"testPage.txt\" file in the same font as is used on the form.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  \n  \n4.  Call the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.Print%2A> method to raise the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#5)]  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/CS/Form1.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Printing.PrintExamples/VB/Form1.vb#0)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A text file named testPage.txt containing the text to print, located in the root of drive C:\\\\. Edit the code to print a different file.  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Windows.Forms, System.Drawing assemblies.  \n  \n-   For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
