The `BindingNavigator` control enables users to navigate through and manipulate data on a Windows Form.  \n  \n The topics in this section provide an overview of the `BindingNavigator` control and offer step-by-step instructions how to use the control navigate data and move through a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [BindingNavigator Control Overview](bindingnavigator-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `BindingNavigator` control, which enables users to move through the items of a data source.  \n  \n [How to: Navigate Data with the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control](how-to-navigate-data-with-the-windows-forms-bindingnavigator-control.md)  \n Provides steps to bind a `BindingNavigator` control to a data source.  \n  \n [How to: Move Through a DataSet with the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control](move-through-a-dataset-with-wf-bindingnavigator-control.md)  \n Demonstrates using a `BindingNavigator` control to move through records in a <xref:System.Data.DataSet>.  \n  \n Also see [How to: Add Load, Save, and Cancel Buttons to the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control](load-save-and-cancel-bindingnavigator.md).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control.
