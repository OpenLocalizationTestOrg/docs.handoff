To paint an area with a drawing, you use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> and one or more <xref:System.Windows.Media.Drawing> objects.   The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> to paint an object with a drawing of two ellipses.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[drawingbrush_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_snip/CS/DrawingBrushExample.xaml#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/CSharp/DrawingBrushExample.cs#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]\n [!code-vb[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/DrawingBrushExample.vb#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the example's output.  \n  \n ![Output from a DrawingBrush](./media/graphicsmm-drawingbrush-simple.png \"graphicsmm_drawingbrush_simple\")  \n  \n (The center of the shape is white for reasons described in     [Control the Fill of a Composite Shape](how-to-control-the-fill-of-a-composite-shape.md).)  \n  \n By setting a <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> object's <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.Viewport%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.TileMode%2A> properties, you can create a repeating pattern. The following example paints an object with a pattern created from a drawing of two ellipses.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[drawingbrush_snip#TiledDrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_snip/CS/TiledDrawingBrushExample.xaml#tileddrawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#TiledDrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/CSharp/TiledDrawingBrushExample.cs#tileddrawingbrushexamplewholepage)]\n [!code-vb[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#TiledDrawingBrushExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/TiledDrawingBrushExample.vb#tileddrawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the tiled <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> output.  \n  \n ![Tiled output from a DrawingBrush](./media/graphicsmm-drawingbrush-tiled.png \"graphicsmm_drawingbrush_tiled\")  \n  \n For more information about drawing brushes, see [Painting with Images, Drawings, and Visuals](painting-with-images-drawings-and-visuals.md).
