When the code in the `stopPlayingButton_Click` event handler runs, any sound currently playing stops. If no sound is playing, nothing happens.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Media.SoundPlayer.PlayLooping#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Media.SoundPlayer.PlayLooping/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Media.SoundPlayer.PlayLooping#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Media.SoundPlayer.PlayLooping/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n-   That you replace the file name `\"c:\\Windows\\Media\\chimes.wav\"` with a valid file name.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n File operations should be enclosed within appropriate exception-handling blocks.  \n  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path name is malformed. For example, it contains characters that are not valid or it is only white space (<xref:System.ArgumentException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException> class).  \n  \n-   The path name is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException> class).  \n  \n-   The path name is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is invalid (<xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is only a colon \":\" (<xref:System.NotSupportedException> class).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file. For example, the file Form1.vb may not be a Visual Basic source file. Verify all inputs before using the data in your application.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer.PlayLooping%2A>   \n [How to: Play a Sound from a Windows
