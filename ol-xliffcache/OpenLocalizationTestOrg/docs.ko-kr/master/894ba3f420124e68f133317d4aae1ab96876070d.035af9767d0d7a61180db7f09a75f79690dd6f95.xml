The node returned from the call is a copy of the node from the source document, including attribute values, the node name, node type, and all namespace-related attributes such as the prefix, local name, and namespace Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The source document is not changed. After you have imported the node, you still have to add it to the tree using one of the methods used to insert nodes.  \n  \n When the node is attached to its new document, the new document owns the node. The reason is that each node, when created, has an owning document, even if the nodes are created in separate document fragments. This is a requirement of the XML Document Object Model (DOM) and is enforced by the factory creation design on the **XmlDocument** class. For example, **CreateElement**, is the only way to create new nodes.  \n  \n Depending on the node type of the imported node and the value of the *deep* parameter, additional information is copied as appropriate. This method attempts to mirror the behavior expected if a fragment of XML or HTML source was copied from one document to another, accounting for the fact that for XML, the two documents may have different document type definitions (DTDs).  \n  \n The following table describes the specific behavior for each type of node that can be imported.  \n  \n|Node Type|*deep* parameter is true|*deep* parameter is false|  \n|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|  \n|XmlAttribute|The <xref:System.Xml.XmlAttribute.Specified%2A> is set to **true** on the XmlAttribute.
