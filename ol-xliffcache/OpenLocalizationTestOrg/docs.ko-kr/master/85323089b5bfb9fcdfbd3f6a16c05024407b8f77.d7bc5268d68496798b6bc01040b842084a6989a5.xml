However, there will be times when you will want to programmatically control the splitter—where it is positioned and to what degree it can be moved.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property and the other properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs. These properties are listed in the following table.  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A> property|Determines if the splitter is movable by means of the keyboard or mouse.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A> property|Determines the distance in pixels from the left or upper edge to the movable splitter bar.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property|Determines the minimum distance, in pixels, that the splitter can be moved by the user.|  \n  \n The example below modifies the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to create a \"snapping splitter\" effect; when the user drags the splitter, it increments in units of 10 pixels rather than the default 1.  \n  \n### To define SplitContainer resize behavior  \n  \n1.  In a procedure, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to the desired size, so that the 'snapping' behavior of the splitter is achieved.  \n  \n     In the following code example, within the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event, the splitter within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control is set to jump 10 pixels when dragged.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n        ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load  \n        Dim splitSnapper as new SplitContainer()  \n        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10  \n        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill  \n        splitSnapper.Parent = me  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void Form1_Load(System.Object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n        SplitContainer splitSnapper = new SplitContainer();  \n        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10;  \n        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;  \n        splitSnapper.Parent = this;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Form1_Load);  \n    ```  \n  \n     Moving the splitter slightly to the left or right will have no discernible effect; however, when the mouse pointer goes 10 pixels in either direction, the splitter will snap to the new position.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,93],"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,81]}]},{"pos":[571,635],"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","linkify":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"The panels of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer&gt;</ph> control lend themselves well to being resized and manipulated by users.","pos":[636,768],"source":"The panels of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control lend themselves well to being resized and manipulated by users."},{"content":"However, there will be times when you will want to programmatically control the splitter—where it is positioned and to what degree it can be moved.","pos":[769,916]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property and the other properties on the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer&gt;</ph> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs.","pos":[923,1168],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property and the other properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs."},{"content":"These properties are listed in the following table.","pos":[1169,1220]},{"content":"Name","pos":[1227,1231]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1232,1243]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A&gt;</ph> property","pos":[1281,1351],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines if the splitter is movable by means of the keyboard or mouse.","pos":[1352,1424]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A&gt;</ph> property","pos":[1429,1500],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines the distance in pixels from the left or upper edge to the movable splitter bar.","pos":[1501,1591]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property","pos":[1596,1668],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines the minimum distance, in pixels, that the splitter can be moved by the user.","pos":[1669,1756]},{"content":"The example below modifies the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property to create a \"snapping splitter\" effect;
