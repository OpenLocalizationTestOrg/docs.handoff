Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:  \n  \n (N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,87],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,75]}]},{"pos":[396,454],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second.","pos":[455,528]},{"pos":[537,548],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[552,696]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[697,719]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[729,774]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[784,851]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[861,940]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[950,1038]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[1048,1082]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[1092,1201]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[1211,1264]},{"pos":[1271,1439],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula:","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:"},{"content":"(N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","pos":[1446,1465]}]}
