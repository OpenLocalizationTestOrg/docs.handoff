In a conceptual model, an association represents a relationship between two [entity types](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) (such as `Customer` and `Order`). In an application, an instance of an association represents a specific association (such as an association between an instance of `Customer` and an instance of `Order`). Association instances are logically grouped in an [association set](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-set.md).  \n  \n An association definition contains the following information:  \n  \n-   A unique name. (Required)  \n  \n-   Two [association ends](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end.md), one for each entity type in the relationship. (Required)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  An association cannot represent a relationship among more than two entity types. An association can, however, define a self-relationship by specifying the same entity type for each of its association ends.  \n  \n-   A [referential integrity constraint](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/referential-integrity-constraint.md). (Optional)  \n  \n Each association end must specify an [association end multiplicity](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end-multiplicity.md) that indicates the number of entity type instances that can be at one end of the association. An association end multiplicity can have a value of one (1), zero or one (0..1), or many (\\*). Entity type instances at one end of an association can be accessed through [navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) or foreign keys if they are exposed on an entity type. For more information, see [Entity Data Model: Foreign Keys](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/foreign-key-property.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `PublishedBy` and `WrittenBy`. The association ends for the `PublishedBy` association are the `Book` and `Publisher` entity types. The multiplicity of the `Publisher` end is one (1) and the multiplicity of the `Book` end is many (\\*), indicating that a publisher publishes many books and a book is published by one publisher.  \n  \n ![Example model with three entity types](./media/association-type/example-model-three-entity-types.gif)  \n  \n The [ADO.NET Entity Framework](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines the `PublishedBy` association shown in the diagram above:  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#AssociationExample](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books.edmx#associationexample)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)\n- [Entity Data Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,100],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"association type\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 26c409f6-06e8-4441-ac78-1b1076a3c005","nodes":[{"content":"association type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,16],"content":"association type","nodes":[{"content":"association type","pos":[0,16]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[107,123],"content":"association type","linkify":"association type","nodes":[{"content":"association type","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>association type<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> (also called an association) is the fundamental building block for describing relationships in the Entity Data Model (EDM).","pos":[124,269],"source":"An *association type* (also called an association) is the fundamental building block for describing relationships in the Entity Data Model (EDM)."},{"content":"In a conceptual model, an association represents a relationship between two <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>entity types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md)</ept> (such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`Customer`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Order`</ph>).","pos":[270,449],"source":" In a conceptual model, an association represents a relationship between two [entity types](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) (such as `Customer` and `Order`)."},{"content":"In an application, an instance of an association represents a specific association (such as an association between an instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Customer`</ph> and an instance of <ph id=\"ph2\">`Order`</ph>).","pos":[450,619],"source":" In an application, an instance of an association represents a specific association (such as an association between an instance of `Customer` and an instance of `Order`)."},{"content":"Association instances are logically grouped in an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>association set<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-set.md)</ept>.","pos":[620,747],"source":" Association instances are logically grouped in an [association set](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-set.md)."},{"content":"An association definition contains the following information:","pos":[754,815]},{"content":"A unique name.","pos":[825,839]},{"content":"(Required)","pos":[840,850]},{"content":"Two <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>association ends<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end.md)</ept>, one for each entity type in the relationship.","pos":[860,988],"source":"Two [association ends](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end.md), one for each entity type in the relationship."},{"content":"(Required)","pos":[989,999]},{"pos":[1011,1231],"content":"[!NOTE]\nAn association cannot represent a relationship among more than two entity types.
