{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Configuring Tracking for a Workflow\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 905adcc9-30a0-4918-acd6-563f86db988a\n---\n\n# Configuring Tracking for a Workflow\n\nA workflow can execute in three ways:\n\n- Hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>\n\n- Executed as a <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>\n\n- Executed directly using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>\n\nDepending on the workflow hosting option, a tracking participant can be added either through code or through a configuration file. This topic describes how tracking is configured by adding a tracking participant to a <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> and to a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, and how to enable tracking when using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>.\n\n## Configuring Workflow Application Tracking\n\nA workflow can run using the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> class. This topic demonstrates how tracking is configured for a [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] workflow application by adding a tracking participant to the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> workflow host. In this case, the workflow runs as a workflow application. You configure a workflow application through code (rather than by using a configuration file), which is a self-hosted .exe file using the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> class. The tracking participant is added as an extension to the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> instance. This is done by adding the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant> to the extensions collection for the WorkflowApplication instance.\n\nFor a workflow application, you can add the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> behavior extension as shown in the following code.\n\n```csharp\nLogActivity activity = new LogActivity();\n\nWorkflowApplication instance = new WorkflowApplication(activity);\nEtwTrackingParticipant trackingParticipant =\n    new EtwTrackingParticipant\n{\n\n        TrackingProfile = new TrackingProfile\n           {\n               Name = \"SampleTrackingProfile\",\n               ActivityDefinitionId = \"ProcessOrder\",\n               Queries = new WorkflowInstanceQuery\n               {\n                  States = { \"*\" }\n              }\n          }\n       };\ninstance.Extensions.Add(trackingParticipant);\n```\n\n### Configuring Workflow Service Tracking\n\nA workflow can be exposed as a WCF service when hosted in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> service host. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> is a specialized .NET ServiceHost implementation for a workflow-based service. This section explains how to configure tracking for a [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] workflow service running in <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>. It is configured through a Web.config file (for a Web-hosted service) or an App.config file (for a service hosted in a stand-alone application, such as a console application) by specifying a service behavior or through code by adding a tracking-specific behavior to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceDescription.Behaviors%2A> collection for the service host.\n\nFor a workflow service hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, you can add the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> using the <`behavior`> element in a configuration file, as shown in the following example.\n\n```xml\n<behaviors>\n   <serviceBehaviors>\n        <behavior>\n          <etwTracking profileName=\"Sample Tracking Profile\" />\n        </behavior>\n   </serviceBehaviors>\n<behaviors>\n```\n\nAlternatively, for a workflow service hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, you can add the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> behavior extension through code. To add a custom tracking participant, create a new behavior extension and add it to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> as shown in the following example code.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you want to view sample code that shows how to create a custom behavior element that adds a custom tracking participant, refer to the [Tracking](./samples/tracking.md) samples.\n\n```csharp\nServiceHost svcHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(WorkflowService), new\n                                 Uri(\"http://localhost:8001/Sample\"));\nEtwTrackingBehavior trackingBehavior =\n    new EtwTrackingBehavior\n    {\n        ProfileName = \"Sample Tracking Profile\"\n    };\nsvcHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(trackingBehavior);\nsvcHost.Open();\n```\n\nThe tracking participant is added to the workflow service host as an extension to the behavior.\n\nThis sample code below shows how to read a tracking profile from configuration file.\n\n```csharp\nTrackingProfile GetProfile(string profileName, string displayName)\n        {\n            TrackingProfile trackingProfile = null;\n            TrackingSection trackingSection = (TrackingSection)WebConfigurationManager.GetSection(\"system.serviceModel/tracking\");\n            if (trackingSection == null)\n            {\n                return null;\n            }\n\n            if (profileName == null)\n            {\n                profileName = \"\";\n            }\n\n            //Find the profile with the specified profile name in the list of profile found in config\n            var match = from p in new List<TrackingProfile>(trackingSection.TrackingProfiles)\n                        where (p.Name == profileName) && ((p.ActivityDefinitionId == displayName) || (p.ActivityDefinitionId == \"*\"))\n                        select p;\n\n            if (match.Count() == 0)\n            {\n                //return an empty profile\n                trackingProfile = new TrackingProfile()\n                {\n                    ActivityDefinitionId = displayName\n                };\n\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                trackingProfile = match.First();\n            }\n\n            return trackingProfile;\n```\n\nThis sample code shows how to add a tracking profile to a workflow host.\n\n```csharp\nWorkflowServiceHost workflowServiceHost = serviceHostBase as WorkflowServiceHost;\nif (null != workflowServiceHost)\n{\n    string workflowDisplayName = workflowServiceHost.Activity.DisplayName;\n    TrackingProfile trackingProfile = GetProfile(this.profileName, workflowDisplayName);\n    workflowServiceHost.WorkflowExtensions.Add(()  => new EtwTrackingParticipant {\n        TrackingProfile = trackingProfile\n    });\n }\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For more information on tracking profiles, refer to [Tracking Profiles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201310).\n\n### Configuring tracking using WorkflowInvoker\n\nTo configure tracking for a workflow executed using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>, add the tracking provider as an extension to a <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> instance. The following code example is from the [Custom Tracking](./samples/custom-tracking.md) sample.\n\n```csharp\nWorkflowInvoker invoker = new WorkflowInvoker(BuildSampleWorkflow());\ninvoker.Extensions.Add(customTrackingParticipant);\ninvoker.Invoke();\n```\n\n### Viewing tracking records in Event Viewer\n\nThere are two Event Viewer logs of particular interest to view when tracking WF execution - the Analytic log and the Debug log. Both reside under the Microsoft&#124;Windows&#124;Application Server-Applications node. Logs within this section contain events from a single application rather than events that have an impact on the entire system.\n\nDebug trace events are written to the Debug Log. To collect WF debug trace events in the Event Viewer, enable the Debug Log.\n\n1. To open Event Viewer, click **Start**, and then click **Run.** In the Run dialog, type `eventvwr`.\n\n2. In the Event Viewer dialog, expand the **Applications and Services Logs** node.\n\n3. Expand the **Microsoft**, **Windows**, and **Application Server-Applications** nodes.\n\n4. Right-click the **Debug** node under the **Application Server-Applications** node, and select **Enable Log**.\n\n5. Execute your tracing-enabled application to generate tracing events.\n\n6. Right-click the **Debug** node and select **Refresh.** Tracing events should be visible in the center pane.\n\nWF 4 provides a tracking participant that writes tracking records to an ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) session. The ETW tracking participant is configured with a tracking profile to subscribe to tracking records. When tracking is enabled, errors tracking records are emitted to ETW. ETW tracking events (between the range of 100-113) corresponding to the tracking events emitted by the ETW tracking participant are written to the Analytic Log.\n\nTo view tracking records, follow these steps.\n\n1. To open Event Viewer, click **Start**, and then click **Run.** In the Run dialog, type `eventvwr`.\n\n2. In the Event Viewer dialog, expand the **Applications and Services Logs** node.\n\n3. Expand the **Microsoft**, **Windows**, and **Application Server-Applications** nodes.\n\n4. Right-click the **Analytic** node under the **Application Server-Applications** node, and select **Enable Log**.\n\n5. Execute your tracking-enabled application to generate tracking records.\n\n6. Right-click the **Analytic** node and select **Refresh.** Tracking records should be visible in the center pane.\n\nThe following image shows tracking events in the event viewer:\n\n![Screenshot of the Event Viewer showing tracking records.](./media/configuring-tracking-for-a-workflow/tracking-event-viewer.png)\n\n### Registering an application-specific provider ID\n\nIf events need to be written to a specific application log, follow these steps to register the new provider manifest.\n\n1. Declare the provider ID in the application configuration file.\n\n    ```xml\n    <system.serviceModel>\n        <diagnostics etwProviderId=\"2720e974-9fe9-477a-bb60-81fe3bf91eec\"/>\n    </system.serviceModel>\n    ```\n\n2. Copy the manifest file from %windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\\\<latest version of [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)]>\\Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications.man to a temporary location, and rename it to Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.man\n\n3. Change the GUID in the manifest file to the new GUID.\n\n    ```xml\n    <provider name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications\" guid=\"{2720e974-9fe9-477a-bb60-81fe3bf91eec}\"\n    ```\n\n4. Change the provider name if you do not want to uninstall the default provider.\n\n    ```xml\n    <provider name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications\" guid=\"{2720e974-9fe9-477a-bb60-81fe3bf91eec}\"\n    ```\n\n5. If you changed the provider name in the previous step, change the channel names in the manifest file to the new provider name.\n\n    ```xml\n    <channel name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1/Admin\" chid=\"ADMIN_CHANNEL\" symbol=\"ADMIN_CHANNEL\" type=\"Admin\" enabled=\"false\" isolation=\"Application\" message=\"$(string.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONSERVER_APPLICATIONS.channel.ADMIN_CHANNEL.message)\" />\n    <channel name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1/Operational\" chid=\"OPERATIONAL_CHANNEL\" symbol=\"OPERATIONAL_CHANNEL\" type=\"Operational\" enabled=\"false\" isolation=\"Application\" message=\"$(string.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONSERVER_APPLICATIONS.channel.OPERATIONAL_CHANNEL.message)\" />\n    <channel name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1/Analytic\" chid=\"ANALYTIC_CHANNEL\" symbol=\"ANALYTIC_CHANNEL\" type=\"Analytic\" enabled=\"false\" isolation=\"Application\" message=\"$(string.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONSERVER_APPLICATIONS.channel.ANALYTIC_CHANNEL.message)\" />\n    <channel name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1/Debug\" chid=\"DEBUG_CHANNEL\" symbol=\"DEBUG_CHANNEL\" type=\"Debug\" enabled=\"false\" isolation=\"Application\" message=\"$(string.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONSERVER_APPLICATIONS.channel.DEBUG_CHANNEL.message)\" />\n    <channel name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1/Perf\" chid=\"PERF_CHANNEL\" symbol=\"PERF_CHANNEL\" type=\"Analytic\" enabled=\"false\" isolation=\"Application\" message=\"$(string.MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_APPLICATIONSERVER_APPLICATIONS.channel.PERF_CHANNEL.message)\" />\n    ```\n\n6. Generate the resource DLL by following these steps.\n\n    1. Install the Windows SDK. The Windows SDK includes the message compiler ([mc.exe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=184606)) and resource compiler ([rc.exe](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=184605)).\n\n    2. In a Windows SDK command prompt, run mc.exe on the new manifest file.\n\n        ```console\n        mc.exe Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.man\n        ```\n\n    3. Run rc.exe on the resource file generated in the previous step.\n\n        ```console\n        rc.exe  Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.rc\n        ```\n\n    4. Create an empty cs file called NewProviderReg.cs.\n\n    5. Create a resource DLL using the C# compiler.\n\n        ```console\n        csc /target:library /win32res:Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.res NewProviderReg.cs /out:Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.dll\n        ```\n\n    6. Change the resource and message dll name in the manifest file from `Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications.Provider1.man` to the new dll name.\n\n        ```xml\n        <provider name=\"Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications_Provider1\" guid=\"{2720e974-9fe9-477a-bb60-81fe3bf91eec}\" symbol=\"Microsoft_Windows_ApplicationServer_ApplicationEvents\" resourceFileName=\"<dll directory>\\Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.dll\" messageFileName=\"<dll directory>\\Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.dll\">\n        ```\n\n    7. Use [wevtutil](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=184608) to register the manifest.\n\n        ```console\n        wevtutil im Microsoft.Windows.ApplicationServer.Applications_Provider1.man\n        ```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Windows Server App Fabric Monitoring](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201273)\n- [Monitoring Applications with App
