Consider swapping the expressions on either side of 'equals'.  \n  \n The `equals` keyword is a special operator that is used in a `join` clause to determine equality between two expressions. The range variable for the left side source sequence is in scope on the left side of equals, and the range variable for the right side source is only in scope on the left side of equals. You can verify this by experimenting with IntelliSense in the following code example.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.
