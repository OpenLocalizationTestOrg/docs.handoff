It provides a tracking infrastructure to track the execution of a workflow instance. The WF tracking infrastructure transparently instruments a workflow to emit records reflecting key events during the execution. This functionality is available by default for any [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] workflow. No changes are required to be made to a [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] workflow for tracking to occur. It is just a matter of deciding how much tracking data you want to receive. When a workflow instance starts or completes, its processing tracking records are emitted. Tracking can also extract business-relevant data associated with the workflow variables. For example, if the workflow represents an order processing system, the order ID can be extracted along with the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> object. In general, enabling WF tracking facilitates diagnostics or business analytics data to be accessed from a workflow execution.  \n  \n These tracking components are equivalent to the tracking service in [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)], the performance has been improved and the programming model simplified for the WF tracking feature. The tracking runtime instruments a workflow instance to emit events related to the workflow life cycle, workflow activities and custom events.  \n  \n Windows Server App Fabric also provides the ability to monitor the execution of a WCF and workflow services. For more information, see [Windows Server App Fabric Monitoring](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201273) and [Monitoring Applications with Windows Server AppFabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201287)  \n  \n To troubleshoot the workflow runtime, you can turn on diagnostic workflow tracing. For more information, see [Workflow Tracing](workflow-tracing.md).  \n  \n To understand the programming model, the primary components of the tracking infrastructure are discussed in this topic:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects emitted from the workflow runtime. For more information, see [Tracking Records](tracking-records.md).  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingParticipant> objects subscribe to <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects. The tracking participants contain the logic to process the payload from the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects (for example, they could choose to write to a file). For more information, see [Tracking Participants](tracking-participants.md).  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingProfile> objects filter tracking records emitted from a workflow instance. For more information, see [Tracking Profiles](tracking-profiles.md).  \n  \n## Workflow Tracking Infrastructure  \n The workflow tracking infrastructure follows a publish-and-subscribe paradigm. The workflow instance is the publisher of tracking records, while subscribers of the tracking records are registered as extensions to the workflow. These extensions that subscribe to <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects are called tracking participants. Tracking participants are extensibility points that access <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingRecord> objects and process them in whatever manner they are written to do so. The tracking infrastructure allows the application of a filter on the outgoing tracking records to allow a participant to subscribe to a subset of the records. This filtering mechanism is accomplished through a tracking profile file.  \n  \n A high level view of the tracking infrastructure is shown in the following illustration:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that shows the workflow tracking infrastructure.](./media/workflow-tracking-and-tracing/workflow-tracking-infrastructure.gif \"WV\")  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Tracking Records](tracking-records.md)
