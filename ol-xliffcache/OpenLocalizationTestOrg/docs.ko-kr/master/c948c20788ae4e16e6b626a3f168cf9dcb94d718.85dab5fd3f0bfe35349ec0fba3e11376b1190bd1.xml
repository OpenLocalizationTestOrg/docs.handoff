At its most basic, a binding must specify the transport (for example, HTTP or TCP) to use. You can also set other characteristics, such as security and transaction support, through bindings.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [WCF Bindings Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/bindings-overview.md)  \n Overview of what WCF bindings do, what bindings the system provides, and how you can define or modify them.  \n  \n [System-Provided Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md)  \n A list of bindings included with WCF.
