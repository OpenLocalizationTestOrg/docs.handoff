Objects that represent queries do not store the resulting collection, but rather the steps to produce the results when needed. The advantage of returning query objects from methods is that they can be further composed or modified. Therefore any return value or `out` parameter of a method that returns a query must also have that type. If a method materializes a query into a concrete <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> or <xref:System.Array> type, it is considered to be returning the query results instead of the query itself. A query variable that is returned from a method can still be composed or modified.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the first method returns a query as a return value, and the second method returns a query as an `out` parameter. Note that in both cases it is a query that is  returned, not query results.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#80](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-return-a-query-from-a-method_1.cs)]  \n\n## See Also  \n [LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,40],"content":"Return a query from a method","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Return a query from a method","pos":[0,28]}]},{"pos":[55,77],"content":"How to return a query.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to return a query.","pos":[0,22]}]},{"pos":[88,107],"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[333,392],"content":"How to: Return a Query from a Method (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Return a Query from a Method (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Return a Query from a Method (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[393,494],"content":"This example shows how to return a query from a method as the return value and as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`out`</ph> parameter.","source":"This example shows how to return a query from a method as the return value and as an `out` parameter."},{"content":"Query objects are composable, meaning that you can return a query from a method.","pos":[501,581]},{"content":"Objects that represent queries do not store the resulting collection, but rather the steps to produce the results when needed.","pos":[582,708]},{"content":"The advantage of returning query objects from methods is that they can be further composed or modified.","pos":[709,812]},{"content":"Therefore any return value or <ph id=\"ph1\">`out`</ph> parameter of a method that returns a query must also have that type.","pos":[813,917],"source":" Therefore any return value or `out` parameter of a method that returns a query must also have that type."},{"content":"If a method materializes a query into a concrete <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Array&gt;</ph> type, it is considered to be returning the query results instead of the query itself.","pos":[918,1118],"source":" If a method materializes a query into a concrete <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> or <xref:System.Array> type, it is considered to be returning the query results instead of the query itself."},{"content":"A query variable that is returned from a method can still be composed or modified.","pos":[1119,1201]},{"pos":[1210,1217],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following example, the first method returns a query as a return value, and the second method returns a query as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`out`</ph> parameter.","pos":[1221,1359],"source":"In the following example, the first method returns a query as a return value, and the second method returns a query as an `out` parameter."},{"content":"Note that in both cases it is a query that is  returned, not query results.","pos":[1360,1435]},{"pos":[1442,1561],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csProgGuideLINQ#80<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-return-a-query-from-a-method_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#80](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-return-a-query-from-a-method_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[1568,1576],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1580,1614],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ Query Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)"}]}
