It is designed for directly running an activity as if it were a method call. It is a lightweight, high-performing, easy to use API for use in scenarios where an activity’s execution does not require the control infrastructure provided by other hosting variations.  \n  \n The sample uses a custom activity that derives from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601><Int32\\> named `Add` that adds two <xref:System.Activities.InArgument%601>, `X` and `Y`, and returns a `Result`<xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601>. (<xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601>\\<T> derives from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601><T\\>, which has an <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument%601>\\<T> named `Result`.) A `Dictionary`\\<string, object> is used to pass arguments into an activity being invoked through <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>. The key of the dictionary corresponds to the name of an argument on the invoked activity. The value associated with a particular key is bound to the argument identified by the key.  \n  \n The sample calls <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A> and passes a dictionary that contains values for `X` and `Y`. The <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> class binds these values to the `Add` activity’s arguments, executes the activity, and returns the result.  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the Invoker.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  To run the solution, press F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
