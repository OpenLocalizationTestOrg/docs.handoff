The text of any comment you want to include. A space is required between the `REM` keyword and `comment`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n You can put a `REM` statement alone on a line, or you can put it on a line following another statement. The `REM` statement must be the last statement on the line. If it follows another statement, the `REM` must be separated from that statement by a space.  \n  \n You can use a single quotation mark (`'`) instead of `REM`. This is true whether your comment follows another statement on the same line or sits alone on a line.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot continue a `REM` statement by using a line-continuation sequence (`_`). Once a comment begins, the compiler does not examine the characters for special meaning. For a multiple-line comment, use another `REM` statement or a comment symbol (`'`) on each line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example illustrates the `REM` statement, which is used to include explanatory remarks in a program. It also shows the alternative of using the single quotation-mark character (`'`) instead of `REM`.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#6](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/rem-statement_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Comments in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/comments-in-code.md)   \n [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,758],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"REM Statement (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vb.'\"\n  - \"vb.Rem\"\n  - \"Rem\"\n  - \"'\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"REM statement\"\n  - \"comments, Visual Basic code\"\n  - \"code comments, Visual Basic\"\n  - \"Visual Basic code, comments\"\n  - \"' comment marker character [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: 34126d7f-e0f9-476d-91e6-b31b398615dc\ncaps.latest.revision: 11\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","nodes":[{"content":"REM Statement (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"REM Statement (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"REM Statement (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[765,793],"content":"REM Statement (Visual Basic)","linkify":"REM Statement (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"REM Statement (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,28]}]},{"content":"Used to include explanatory remarks in the source code of a program.","pos":[794,862]},{"pos":[871,877],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[927,932],"content":"Parts","linkify":"Parts","nodes":[{"content":"Parts","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"Optional.","pos":[949,958]},{"content":"The text of any comment you want to include.","pos":[959,1003]},{"content":"A space is required between the <ph id=\"ph1\">`REM`</ph> keyword and <ph id=\"ph2\">`comment`</ph>.","pos":[1004,1064],"source":" A space is required between the `REM` keyword and `comment`."},{"pos":[1073,1080],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"You can put a <ph id=\"ph1\">`REM`</ph> statement alone on a line, or you can put it on a line following another statement.","pos":[1084,1187],"source":"You can put a `REM` statement alone on a line, or you can put it on a line following another statement."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`REM`</ph> statement must be the last statement on the line.","pos":[1188,1247],"source":" The `REM` statement must be the last statement on the line."},{"content":"If it follows another statement, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`REM`</ph> must be separated from that statement by a space.","pos":[1248,1340],"source":" If it follows another statement, the `REM` must be separated from that statement by a space."},{"content":"You can use a single quotation mark (<ph id=\"ph1\">`'`</ph>) instead of <ph id=\"ph2\">`REM`</ph>.","pos":[1347,1406],"source":"You can use a single quotation mark (`'`) instead of `REM`."},{"content":"This is true whether your comment follows another statement on the same line or sits alone on a line.","pos":[1407,1508]},{"pos":[1516,1795],"content":"[!NOTE]\n You cannot continue a `REM` statement by using a line-continuation sequence (`_`).
