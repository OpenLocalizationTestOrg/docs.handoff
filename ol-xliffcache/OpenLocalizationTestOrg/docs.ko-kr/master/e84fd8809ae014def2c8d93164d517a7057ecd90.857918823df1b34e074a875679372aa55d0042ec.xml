For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  \n  \n This topic introduces guidelines and conventions for implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider>, including information about properties, methods, and events. Links to additional references are listed at the end of the overview.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TablePattern> control pattern is used to support controls that act as containers for a collection of child elements. The children of this element must implement <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableItemProvider> and be organized in a two-dimensional logical coordinate system that can be traversed by row and column. This control pattern is analogous to <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider>, with the distinction that any control implementing <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider> must also expose a column and/or row header relationship for each child element. For examples of controls that implement this control pattern, see [Control Pattern Mapping for UI Automation Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/control-pattern-mapping-for-ui-automation-clients.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions\"></a>   \n## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  \n When implementing the Table control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  \n  \n-   Access to the content of individual cells is through a two-dimensional logical coordinate system or array provided by the required concurrent implementation of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IGridProvider>.  \n  \n-   A column or row header can be contained within a table object or be a separate header object that is associated with a table object.  \n  \n-   Column and row headers may include both a primary header as well as any supporting headers.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This concept becomes evident in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xl](../../../includes/tlasharptla-xl-md.md)] spreadsheet where a user has defined a \"First name\" column. This column now has two headers—the \"First name\" header defined by the user and the alphanumeric designation for that column assigned by the application.  \n  \n-   See [Implementing the UI Automation Grid Control Pattern](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-grid-control-pattern.md) for related grid functionality.  \n  \n ![Table with complex header items.](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/media/uia-tablepattern-complex-column-headers.PNG \"UIA_TablePattern_Complex_Column_Headers\")  \nExample of a Table with Complex Column Headers  \n  \n ![Table with ambiguous RowOrColumnMajor property.](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/media/uia-tablepattern-roworcolumnmajorproperty.PNG \"UIA_TablePattern_RowOrColumnMajorProperty\")  \nExample of a Table with Ambiguous RowOrColumnMajor Property  \n  \n<a name=\"Required_Members_for_ITableProvider\"></a>   \n## Required Members for ITableProvider  \n The following properties and methods are required for the ITableProvider interface.  \n  \n|Required members|Member type|Notes|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.RowOrColumnMajor%2A>|Property|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.GetColumnHeaders%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.ITableProvider.GetRowHeaders%2A>|Method|None|  \n  \n This control pattern has no associated events.  \n  \n<a name=\"Exceptions\"></a>   \n## Exceptions  \n This control pattern has no associated exceptions.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [UI Automation Control Patterns Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-overview.md)   \n [Support Control Patterns in a UI Automation Provider](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/support-control-patterns-in-a-ui-automation-provider.md)   \n [UI Automation Control Patterns for Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-for-clients.md)   \n [Implementing the UI Automation TableItem Control Pattern](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-tableitem-control-pattern.md)   \n [Implementing the UI Automation Grid Control Pattern](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/implementing-the-ui-automation-grid-control-pattern.md)   \n [UI Automation Tree Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-tree-overview.md)   \n [Use Caching in UI Automation](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-caching-in-ui-automation.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,81],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,69]}]},{"pos":[503,555],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern","linkify":"Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation Table Control Pattern","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[558,1020],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
