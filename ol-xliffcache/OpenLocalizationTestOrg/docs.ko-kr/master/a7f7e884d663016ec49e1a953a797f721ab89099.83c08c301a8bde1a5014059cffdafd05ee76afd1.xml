Set the`DataSource` property to a data source object. Possible data sources include a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface. For more information, see [Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n2.  If you are binding to a table, set the`DisplayMember` property to the name of a column in the data source.  \n  \n     \\- or -  \n  \n     If you are binding to an <xref:System.Collections.IList>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub BindComboBox()  \n      ComboBox1.DataSource = DataSet1.Tables(\"Suppliers\")  \n      ComboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\"  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void BindComboBox()  \n    {  \n      comboBox1.DataSource = dataSet1.Tables[\"Suppliers\"];  \n      comboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\";  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you are bound to a data source that does not implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList> interface, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, the bound control's data will not be updated when the data source is updated. For example, if you have a combo box bound to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> and data is added to the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, these new items will not appear in the combo box. However, you can force the combo box to be updated by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.SuspendBinding%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.ResumeBinding%2A> methods on the instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingContext> class to which the control is bound.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>   \n [Windows Forms Data Binding](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/windows-forms-data-binding.md)   \n [Data Binding and Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-binding-and-windows-forms.md)   \n [Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,812],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,81]}]}],"pos":[6,90],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
