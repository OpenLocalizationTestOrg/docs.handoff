The topics in this section show examples that use <xref:System.Threading.CancellationToken> and important `Task` methods such as <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAny%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n By using `WhenAny` and `WhenAll`, you can more easily start multiple tasks and await their completion by monitoring a single task.  \n  \n-   `WhenAny` returns a task that completes when any task in a collection is complete.  \n  \n     For examples that use `WhenAny`, see [Cancel Remaining Async Tasks after One Is Complete (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-remaining-async-tasks-after-one-is-complete.md) and [Start Multiple Async Tasks and Process Them As They Complete (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/start-multiple-async-tasks-and-process-them-as-they-complete.md).  \n  \n-   `WhenAll` returns a task that completes when all tasks in a collection are complete.  \n  \n     For more information and an example that uses `WhenAll`, see [How to: Extend the async Walkthrough by Using Task.WhenAll (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/how-to-extend-the-async-walkthrough-by-using-task-whenall.md).  \n  \n This section includes the following examples.  \n  \n-   [Cancel an Async Task or a List of Tasks (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-an-async-task-or-a-list-of-tasks.md).  \n  \n-   [Cancel Async Tasks after a Period of Time (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-async-tasks-after-a-period-of-time.md)  \n  \n-   [Cancel Remaining Async Tasks after One Is Complete (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-remaining-async-tasks-after-one-is-complete.md)  \n  \n-   [Start Multiple Async Tasks and Process Them As They Complete (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/start-multiple-async-tasks-and-process-them-as-they-complete.md)  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To run the examples, you must have Visual Studio 2012 or newer and the .NET Framework 4.5 or newer installed on your computer.  \n  \n The projects create a UI that contains a button that starts the process and a button that cancels it, as the following image shows. The buttons are named `startButton` and `cancelButton`.  \n  \n ![WPF window with Cancel button](./media/fine-tuning-your-async-application/cancellation-and-start-button.png \"Dialog box with a Start
