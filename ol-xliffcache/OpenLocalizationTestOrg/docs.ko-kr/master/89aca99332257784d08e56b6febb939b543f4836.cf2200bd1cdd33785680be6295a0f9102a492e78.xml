Workflows can be debugged in the designer, in XAML, and in code.  \n  \n## Debugging in the Workflow Designer  \n Breakpoints can be set on activities in the workflow designer by either highlighting the activity and pressing **F9** or by using the activity’s context menu. Execution of the workflow then breaks when the workflow host is run in debug mode. In the following screenshot, workflow execution is paused at a breakpoint. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][Debugging Workflows with the Workflow Designer](/visualstudio/workflow-designer/debugging-workflows-with-the-workflow-designer).  \n  \n## Debugging in XAML  \n If a workflow has paused at a breakpoint in the designer, the workflow can also be debugged in XAML. To view the point of execution in XAML, select **XAML View** in the workflow designer when workflow execution is paused. Debugging can be switched back to the designer by re-opening the workflow in the designer from the solution explorer. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][How to: Debug XAML with the Workflow Designer](/visualstudio/workflow-designer/how-to-debug-xaml-with-the-workflow-designer).  \n  \n## Debugging in Code  \n Code breakpoints can be used in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] in the same way that they can be used in other imperative applications. Click the left margin of the code pane to create a code breakpoint, or press **F9** to place a breakpoint at the cursor location.  \n  \n## Attaching to a Workflow Process  \n Workflow debugging also supports using Visual Studio’s infrastructure to attach to a process. This enables the workflow author to debug a workflow running in a different host environment such as Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0.  \n  \n## Remote Debugging  \n [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)] remote debugging functions the same as remote debugging for other [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] components. For information on using remote debugging, see [How to: Enable Remote Debugging](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=196257).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the workflow application targets the x86 architecture and is hosted on a computer running a 64 bit operating system, then remote debugging will not work unless [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] is installed on the remote computer or the target for the workflow application is changed to **Any CPU**.  \n  \n## Extending the Workflow Debugging Service  \n The workflow debugger service is now public and can be used to create custom applications such as monitoring, simulation, and debugging in a re-hosted designer.
