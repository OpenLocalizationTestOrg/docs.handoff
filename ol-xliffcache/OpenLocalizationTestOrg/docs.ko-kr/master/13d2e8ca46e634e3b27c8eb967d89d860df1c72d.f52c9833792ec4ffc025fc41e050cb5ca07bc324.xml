In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md), you implemented a WCF client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service. This topic describes how to verify the discovery proxy, the service, and the client application work as expected.  \n  \n### Run the Discovery Proxy  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  \n  \n2.  You may see a dialog that says: Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program. If you see this message, click the **Unblock** button.  \n  \n3.  Within the command prompt, run the discovery proxy, DiscoveryProxy.exe.  \n  \n4.  The application should display the following text: `Proxy started. Hit Enter to exit`.  \n  \n### Run the Discoverable Service  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  \n  \n2.  Within the command prompt, run the Service.exe discoverable service.  \n  \n3.  The DiscoveryProxy.exe should display the following text: `******* Adding the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 3.******* Done *******` .  \n  \n### Run the Client Application  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt.  \n  \n2.  Within the command prompt, run the client.exe application.  \n  \n3.  After a few seconds the client application displays the following text: Connecting to [Service-Endpoint].  \n  \n4.  The service.exe should then display the following text: Greeting request received, I will respond.  \n  \n5.  The client.exe should then display the following text: Hello Client!  \n  \n### Shut Down the Applications  \n  \n1.  Shut down the client application.  \n  \n2.  Shut down the service. The discovery proxy displays the following text: `******* Removing the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 2.3.******* Done *******`.  \n  \n3.  Shut down the discovery proxy.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WCF Discovery Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-discovery-overview.md)\n- [How to: Implement a Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-implement-a-discovery-proxy.md)\n- [How to: Implement a Discoverable Service that Registers with the Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/discoverable-service-that-registers-with-the-discovery-proxy.md)\n- [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,116],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: d96e3fa2-3c42-4e5d-8244-2694081bdc32","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[123,155],"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","linkify":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"This is the fourth of four topics that shows how to implement a discovery proxy.","pos":[156,236]},{"content":"In the previous topic, <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md)</ept>, you implemented a WCF client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service.","pos":[237,562],"source":" In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md), you implemented a WCF client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service."},{"content":"This topic describes how to verify the discovery proxy, the service, and the client application work as expected.","pos":[563,676]},{"pos":[686,709],"content":"Run the Discovery Proxy","linkify":"Run the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"content":"Run the Discovery Proxy","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Open a command prompt as an administrator.","pos":[719,761]},{"content":"You may see a dialog that says: Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program.","pos":[771,862]},{"content":"If you see this message, click the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Unblock<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> button.","pos":[863,917],"source":" If you see this message, click the **Unblock** button."},{"content":"Within the command prompt, run the discovery proxy, DiscoveryProxy.exe.","pos":[927,998]},{"pos":[1008,1094],"content":"The application should display the following text: <ph id=\"ph1\">`Proxy started.
