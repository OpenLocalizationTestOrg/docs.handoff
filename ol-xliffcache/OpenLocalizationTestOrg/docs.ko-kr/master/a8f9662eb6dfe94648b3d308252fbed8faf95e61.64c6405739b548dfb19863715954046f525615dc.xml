In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the `partial` modifier. If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword `partial`.  \n  \n This error also occurs if you declare a class and accidentally give it the same name as a partial class that's declared elsewhere in the same namespace.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0260:  \n\n```csharp\n// CS0260.cs  \n// You must mark both parts of the definition of class C\n// by using the partial keyword.  \n  \n// The following line causes CS0260. To resolve the error, add  \n// the 'partial' keyword to the declaration.  \nclass C\n{  \n}  \n  \npartial class C  \n{  \n}  \n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Partial Classes and Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0260\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0260\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0260\"\nms.assetid: 58e091da-e093-4093-86df-dcd24ffab750","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0260","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Missing partial modifier on declaration of type 'type'; another partial declaration of this type exists","pos":[195,298]},{"content":"This error indicates that you have declared multiple classes that have the same name.","pos":[305,390]},{"content":"In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the <ph id=\"ph1\">`partial`</ph> modifier.","pos":[391,481],"source":" In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the `partial` modifier."},{"content":"If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword <ph id=\"ph1\">`partial`</ph>.","pos":[482,588],"source":" If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword `partial`."},{"content":"This error also occurs if you declare a class and accidentally give it the same name as a partial class that's declared elsewhere in the same namespace.","pos":[595,747]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0260:","pos":[754,792]},{"pos":[1081,1089],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1093,1208],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Partial Classes and Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Partial Classes and Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)"}]}
