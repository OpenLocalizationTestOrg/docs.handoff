For example, an enterprise that has its own implementation of a cryptographic algorithm can make that implementation the default instead of the implementation shipped in the [!INCLUDE[winsdkshort](../../../includes/winsdkshort-md.md)]. Although managed applications that use cryptography can always choose to explicitly bind to a particular implementation, it is recommended that they create cryptographic objects by using the crypto configuration system.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Mapping Algorithm Names to Cryptography Classes](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/map-algorithm-names-to-cryptography-classes.md)  \n Describes how to map an algorithm name to a cryptography class.  \n  \n [Mapping Object Identifiers to Cryptography Algorithms](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/map-object-identifiers-to-cryptography-algorithms.md)  \n Describes how to map an object identifier to a cryptography algorithm.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Cryptographic Services](../../../docs/standard/security/cryptographic-services.md)  \n Provides an overview of cryptographic services provided by the [!INCLUDE[winsdkshort](../../../includes/winsdkshort-md.md)].  \n  \n [Cryptography Settings Schema](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/cryptography/index.md)  \n Describes elements that map friendly algorithm names to classes that implement cryptography algorithms.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Configuring Cryptography Classes\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
