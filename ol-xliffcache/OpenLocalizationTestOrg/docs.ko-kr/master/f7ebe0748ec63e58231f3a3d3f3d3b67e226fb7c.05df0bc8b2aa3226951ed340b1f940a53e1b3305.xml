If this trace is being emitted in user extension code, it indicates that the user extension code is closing a message that has already been closed. If this trace is being emitted through product code, it indicates that the user extension code could potentially be closing a message too early.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[365,403],"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","pos":[404,442]},{"pos":[451,462],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"A message was closed again.","pos":[466,493]},{"content":"A message should be closed only once.","pos":[500,537]},{"content":"If this trace is being emitted in user extension code, it indicates that the user extension code is closing a message that has already been closed.","pos":[538,685]},{"content":"If this trace is being emitted through product code, it indicates that the user extension code could potentially be closing a message too early.","pos":[686,830]},{"pos":[839,847],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[851,925],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[928,1083],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1086,1175],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
