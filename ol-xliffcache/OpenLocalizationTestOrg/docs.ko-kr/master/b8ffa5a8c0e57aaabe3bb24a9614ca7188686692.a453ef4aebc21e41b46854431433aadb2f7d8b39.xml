You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31043  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).  \n  \n2.  If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Structure demoStruct  \n        Public demoArray() As Integer  \n    End Structure  \n    Sub useStruct()  \n        Dim struct As demoStruct  \n        ReDim struct.demoArray(9)  \n        Struct.demoArray(2) = 777  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)   \n [How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,105],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,93]}]},{"pos":[629,705],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","linkify":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"An array in a structure is declared with an initial size.","pos":[706,763]},{"content":"You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.","pos":[764,867]},{"pos":[874,895],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31043","source":"**Error ID:** BC31043"},{"pos":[904,925],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).","pos":[935,999]},{"content":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ReDim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)</ept> when your code is running.","pos":[1009,1208],"source":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running."},{"content":"The following example illustrates this.","pos":[1209,1248]},{"pos":[1510,1518],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Arrays<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1522,1606],"source":"[Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Declare a Structure<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)</ept>","pos":[1609,1739],"source":" [How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)"}]}
