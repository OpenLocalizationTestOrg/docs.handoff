In the ADO.NET <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, the relationship between tables is implemented using a <xref:System.Data.DataRelation>. When you create a **DataRelation**, the parent-child relationships of the columns are managed only through the relation. The tables and columns are separate entities. In the hierarchical representation of data that XML provides, the parent-child relationships are represented by parent elements that contain nested child elements.  \n  \n To facilitate the nesting of child objects when a **DataSet** is synchronized with an <xref:System.Xml.XmlDataDocument> or written as XML data using **WriteXml**, the **DataRelation** exposes a **Nested** property. Setting the **Nested** property of a **DataRelation** to **true** causes the child rows of the relation to be nested within the parent column when written as XML data or synchronized with an **XmlDataDocument**. The **Nested** property of the **DataRelation** is **false**, by default.  \n  \n For example, consider the following **DataSet**.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Assumes connection is a valid SqlConnection.  \nDim customerAdapter As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter( _  \n  \"SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers\", connection)  \nDim orderAdapter As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter( _  \n  \"SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate FROM Orders\", connection)  \n  \nconnection.Open()  \n  \nDim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet(\"CustomerOrders\")  \ncustomerAdapter.Fill(dataSet, \"Customers\")  \norderAdapter.Fill(dataSet, \"Orders\")  \n  \nconnection.Close()  \n  \nDim customerOrders As DataRelation = dataSet.Relations.Add( _  \n  \"CustOrders\", dataSet.Tables(\"Customers\").Columns(\"CustomerID\"), _  \n  dataSet.Tables(\"Orders\").Columns(\"CustomerID\"))  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Assumes connection is a valid SqlConnection.  \nSqlDataAdapter customerAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(  \n  \"SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers\", connection);  \nSqlDataAdapter orderAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(  \n  \"SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate FROM Orders\", connection);  \n  \nconnection.Open();  \n  \nDataSet dataSet = new DataSet(\"CustomerOrders\");  \ncustomerAdapter.Fill(dataSet, \"Customers\");  \norderAdapter.Fill(dataSet, \"Orders\");  \n  \nconnection.Close();  \n  \nDataRelation customerOrders = dataSet.Relations.Add(  \n  \"CustOrders\", dataSet.Tables[\"Customers\"].Columns[\"CustomerID\"],  \n  dataSet.Tables[\"Orders\"].Columns[\"CustomerID\"]);  \n```  \n  \n Because the **Nested** property of the **DataRelation** object is not set to **true** for this **DataSet**, the child objects are not nested within the parent elements when this **DataSet** is represented as XML data. Transforming the XML representation of a **DataSet** that contains related **DataSet**s with non-nested data relations can cause slow performance. We recommend that you nest the data relations. To do this, set the **Nested** property to **true**. Then write code in the XSLT style sheet that uses top-down hierarchical XPath query expressions to locate and transform the data.  \n  \n The following code example shows the result from calling **WriteXml** on the **DataSet**.  \n  \n```  \n<CustomerOrders>  \n  <Customers>  \n    <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n    <CompanyName>Alfreds Futterkiste</CompanyName>  \n  </Customers>  \n  <Customers>  \n    <CustomerID>ANATR</CustomerID>  \n    <CompanyName>Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados</CompanyName>  \n  </Customers>  \n  <Orders>  \n    <OrderID>10643</OrderID>  \n    <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n    <OrderDate>1997-08-25T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n  </Orders>  \n  <Orders>  \n    <OrderID>10692</OrderID>  \n    <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n    <OrderDate>1997-10-03T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n  </Orders>  \n  <Orders>  \n    <OrderID>10308</OrderID>  \n    <CustomerID>ANATR</CustomerID>  \n    <OrderDate>1996-09-18T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n  </Orders>  \n</CustomerOrders>  \n```  \n  \n Note that the **Customers** element and the **Orders** elements are shown as sibling elements. If you wanted the **Orders** elements to show up as children of their respective parent elements, the **Nested** property of the **DataRelation** would need to be set to **true** and you would add the following:  \n  \n```vb  \ncustomerOrders.Nested = True  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \ncustomerOrders.Nested = true;  \n```  \n  \n The following code shows what the resulting output would look like, with the **Orders** elements nested within their respective parent elements.  \n  \n```  \n<CustomerOrders>  \n  <Customers>  \n    <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n    <Orders>  \n      <OrderID>10643</OrderID>  \n      <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n      <OrderDate>1997-08-25T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n    </Orders>  \n    <Orders>  \n      <OrderID>10692</OrderID>  \n      <CustomerID>ALFKI</CustomerID>  \n      <OrderDate>1997-10-03T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n    </Orders>  \n    <CompanyName>Alfreds Futterkiste</CompanyName>  \n  </Customers>  \n  <Customers>  \n    <CustomerID>ANATR</CustomerID>  \n    <Orders>  \n      <OrderID>10308</OrderID>  \n      <CustomerID>ANATR</CustomerID>  \n      <OrderDate>1996-09-18T00:00:00</OrderDate>  \n    </Orders>  \n    <CompanyName>Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados</CompanyName>  \n  </Customers>  \n</CustomerOrders>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using XML in a
