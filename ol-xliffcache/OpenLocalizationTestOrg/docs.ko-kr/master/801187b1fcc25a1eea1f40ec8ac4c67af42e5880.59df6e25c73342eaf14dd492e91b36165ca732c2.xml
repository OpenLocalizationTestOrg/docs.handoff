Fields that are declared `volatile` are not subject to compiler optimizations that assume access by a single thread. This ensures that the most up-to-date value is present in the field at all times.  \n  \n The `volatile` modifier is usually used for a field that is accessed by multiple threads without using the [lock](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/lock-statement.md) statement to serialize access.  \n  \n The `volatile` keyword can be applied to fields of these types:  \n  \n-   Reference types.  \n  \n-   Pointer types (in an unsafe context). Note that although the pointer itself can be volatile, the object that it points to cannot. In other words, you cannot declare a \"pointer to volatile.\"  \n  \n-   Types such as sbyte, byte, short, ushort, int, uint, char, float, and bool.  \n  \n-   An enum type with one of the following base types: byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, or uint.  \n  \n-   Generic type parameters known to be reference types.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.IntPtr> and <xref:System.UIntPtr>.  \n  \n The volatile keyword can only be applied to fields of a class or struct. Local variables cannot be declared `volatile`.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to declare a public field variable as `volatile`.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsModifiers#24](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/volatile_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how an auxiliary or worker thread can be created and used to perform processing in parallel with that of the primary thread.
