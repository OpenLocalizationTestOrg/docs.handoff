For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  \n  \n When you call the same function outside a query, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates a simple query from the method call expression. The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter `@p0` is bound to the constant passed in):  \n  \n```  \nSELECT dbo.ReverseCustName(@p0)  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates the following:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/Program.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/Module1.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method `ReverseCustName`. The function is not executed immediately because query execution is deferred. The SQL built for this query translates to a call to the user-defined function in the database (see the SQL code following the query).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/Program.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/Module1.vb#5)]  \n  \n```  \nSELECT [t0].[ContactName],  \n    dbo.ReverseCustName([t0].[ContactTitle]) AS [Title]  \nFROM [Customers] AS [t0]  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,373],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: f80d4327-b6a5-4aa8-a743-e95d09a2a02e\ncaps.latest.revision: 2\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[380,422],"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","linkify":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"Although you can call user-defined functions inline, functions that are included in a query whose execution is deferred are not executed until the query is executed.","pos":[423,588]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)</ept>.","pos":[589,730],"source":" For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)."},{"content":"When you call the same function outside a query, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> creates a simple query from the method call expression.","pos":[737,909],"source":"When you call the same function outside a query, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates a simple query from the method call expression."},{"content":"The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter <ph id=\"ph1\">`@p0`</ph> is bound to the constant passed in):","pos":[910,999],"source":" The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter `@p0` is bound to the constant passed in):"},{"pos":[1055,1145],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> creates the following:","source":"[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates the following:"},{"pos":[1390,1397],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method <ph id=\"ph2\">`ReverseCustName`</ph>.","pos":[1401,1584],"source":"In the following [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method `ReverseCustName`."},{"content":"The function is not executed immediately because query execution is deferred.","pos":[1585,1662]},{"content":"The SQL built for this query translates to a call to the user-defined function in the database (see the SQL code following the query).","pos":[1663,1797]},{"pos":[2171,2179],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2183,2288],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>User-Defined Functions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)</ept>","source":"[User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)"}]}
