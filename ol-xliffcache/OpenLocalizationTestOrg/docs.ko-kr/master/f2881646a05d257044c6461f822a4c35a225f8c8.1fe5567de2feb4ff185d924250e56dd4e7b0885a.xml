For more information about access keys, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md).  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"accept\" button of the form, pressing ENTER chooses the button, even if another control has the focus — except if that other control is another button, a multi-line text box, or a custom control that traps the enter key.  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"cancel\" button of the form, pressing ESC chooses the button, even if another control has the focus.  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A> method to select the button programmatically.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Button Control Overview](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)\n- [Button Control](button-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,199],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Button control [Windows Forms], selecting\"\nms.assetid: fe2fc058-5118-4f70-b264-6147d64a7a8d","nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[206,251],"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","linkify":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"A Windows Forms button can be selected in the following ways:","pos":[252,313]},{"content":"Use a mouse to click the button.","pos":[323,355]},{"pos":[365,441],"content":"Invoke the button's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click&gt;</ph> event in code.","source":"Invoke the button's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event in code."},{"content":"Move the focus to the button by pressing the TAB key, and then choose the button by pressing the SPACEBAR or ENTER.","pos":[451,566]},{"content":"Press the access key (ALT + the underlined letter) for the button.","pos":[576,642]},{"content":"For more information about access keys, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md)</ept>.","pos":[643,800],"source":" For more information about access keys, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md)."},{"content":"If the button is the \"accept\" button of the form, pressing ENTER chooses the button, even if another control has the focus — except if that other control is another button, a multi-line text box, or a custom control that traps the enter key.","pos":[810,1051]},{"content":"If the button is the \"cancel\" button of the form, pressing ESC chooses the button, even if another control has the focus.","pos":[1061,1182]},{"pos":[1192,1297],"content":"Call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A&gt;</ph> method to select the button programmatically.","source":"Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A> method to select the button programmatically."},{"pos":[1306,1314],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1318,1385],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Button Control Overview](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1388,1486],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)"},{"pos":[1489,1538],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Control<ept id=\"p1\">](button-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Button Control](button-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
