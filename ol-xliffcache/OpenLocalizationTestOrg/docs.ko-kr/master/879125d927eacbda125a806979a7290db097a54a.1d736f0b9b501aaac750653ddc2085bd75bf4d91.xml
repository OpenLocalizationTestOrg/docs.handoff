runtime (CLR) to make virtual memory requests through the host, instead of using the standard Win32 virtual memory functions.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|[AcquiredVirtualAddressSpace Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-acquiredvirtualaddressspace-method.md)|Notifies the host that the common language runtime (CLR) has acquired the specified memory from the operating system.|  \n|[CreateMAlloc Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-createmalloc-method.md)|Gets an interface pointer to an [IHostMAlloc](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmalloc-interface.md) instance that is used to request memory allocations from a heap created by the host.|  \n|[GetMemoryLoad Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-getmemoryload-method.md)|Gets the amount of physical memory that is currently being used, as reported by the host.|  \n|[NeedsVirtualAddressSpace Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-needsvirtualaddressspace-method.md)|Notifies the host that the CLR is going to attempt to use the specified memory.|  \n|[RegisterMemoryNotificationCallback Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-registermemorynotificationcallback-method.md)|Registers a pointer to a callback function that the host invokes to notify the CLR of the current memory load on the computer.|  \n|[ReleasedVirtualAddressSpace Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-releasedvirtualaddressspace-method.md)|Notifies the host that the CLR has finished using the specified memory.|  \n|[VirtualAlloc Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-virtualalloc-method.md)|Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function, which reserves or commits a region of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.|  \n|[VirtualFree Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-virtualfree-method.md)|Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function, which releases, decommits, or releases and decommits a region of pages within the virtual address space of the calling process.|  \n|[VirtualProtect Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-virtualprotect-method.md)|Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function, which changes the protection on a region of committed pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.|  \n|[VirtualQuery Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-virtualquery-method.md)|Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function, which retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `IHostMemoryManager` also provides methods for the CLR to obtain a pointer through which to make memory requests on the heap and to get the level of memory pressure in the process, as reported by the host.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IHostMalloc
