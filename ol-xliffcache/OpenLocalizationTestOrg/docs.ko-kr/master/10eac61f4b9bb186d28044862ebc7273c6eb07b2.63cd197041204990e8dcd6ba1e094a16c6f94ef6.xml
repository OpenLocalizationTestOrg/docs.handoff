Some exceptions can be handled in a `catch` block and the problem solved without the exception being re-thrown; however, more often the only thing that you can do is make sure that the appropriate exception is thrown.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException> is not the most appropriate exception: <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> makes more sense for the method because the error is caused by the `index` argument passed in by the caller.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#5](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-handle-an-exception-using-try-catch_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Comments  \n The code that causes an exception is enclosed in the `try` block. A `catch` statement is added immediately after to handle `IndexOutOfRangeException`, if it occurs. The `catch` block handles the `IndexOutOfRangeException` and throws the more appropriate `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception instead. In order to provide the caller with as much information as possible, consider specifying the original exception as the <xref:System.Exception.InnerException%2A> of the new exception. Because the <xref:System.Exception.InnerException%2A> property is [readonly](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/readonly.md), you must assign it in the constructor of the new exception.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Exceptions and Exception Handling](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/index.md)   \n [Exception Handling](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/exception-handling.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,654],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try-catch (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,83],"content":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try-catch (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try-catch (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,83]}]}],"pos":[6,92],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Handle an Exception Using try-catch (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-csharp\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"CSharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"exception handling [C#], try/catch blocks\"\n  - \"exceptions [C#], try/catch blocks\"\n  - \"try/catch blocks [C#]\"\nms.assetid: ca8e3773-980e-4767-8633-7408540e9818\ncaps.latest.revision: 14\nauthor: \"BillWagner\"\nms.author: \"wiwagn\"\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[661,727],"content":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try/catch (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try/catch (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Handle an Exception Using try/catch (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"The purpose of a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>try-catch<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md)</ept> block is to catch and handle an exception generated by working code.","pos":[728,883],"source":"The purpose of a [try-catch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md) block is to catch and handle an exception generated by working code."},{"content":"Some exceptions can be handled in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`catch`</ph> block and the problem solved without the exception being re-thrown;
