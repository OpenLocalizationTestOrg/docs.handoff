You can perform Extensible Stylesheet Language for Transformations (XSLT) transformations using the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform> class. See [Using the XslCompiledTransform Class](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/using-the-xslcompiledtransform-class.md) and [Migrating From the XslTransform Class](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/migrating-from-the-xsltransform-class.md) for more information.  \n  \n The goal of the XSLT is to transform the content of a source XML document into another document that is different in format or structure (for example, to transform XML into HTML for use on a Web site or to transform it into a document that contains only the fields required by an application). This transformation process is specified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) XSLT version 1.0 recommendation located at www.w3.org/TR/xslt. In the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class, found in the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl> namespace, is the XSLT processor that implements the functionality of this specification. There are a small number of features that have not been implemented from the W3C XSLT 1.0 recommendation, listed in [Outputs from an XslTransform](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/outputs-from-an-xsltransform.md). The following figure shows the transformation architecture of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  \n  \n## Overview  \n ![XSLT Transformation Architecture](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/media/xslttransformationswithxsltransformclass.gif \"xsltTransformationsWithXslTransformClass\")  \nTransformation Architecture  \n  \n The XSLT recommendation uses XML Path Language (XPath) to select parts of an XML document, where XPath is a query language used to navigate nodes of a document tree. As shown in the diagram, the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] implementation of XPath is used to select parts of XML stored in several classes, such as an <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>, an <xref:System.Xml.XmlDataDocument>, and an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>. An <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> is an optimized XSLT data store, and when used with <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform>, it provides XSLT transformations with good performance.  \n  \n The following table list commonly uses classes when working with <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> and XPath and their function.  \n  \n|Class or Interface|Function|  \n|------------------------|--------------|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator>|It is an API that provides a cursor style model for navigating over a store, along with XPath query support. It does not provide editing of the underlying store. For editing, use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> class.|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.IXPathNavigable>|It is an interface that provides a `CreateNavigator` method to an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> for the store.|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>|It enables editing of this document. It implements <xref:System.Xml.XPath.IXPathNavigable>, allowing document-editing scenarios where XSLT transformations are subsequently required. For more information, see [XmlDocument Input to XslTransform](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xmldocument-input-to-xsltransform.md).|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XmlDataDocument>|It is derived from the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>. It bridges the relational and XML worlds by using a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> to optimize storage of structured data within the XML document according to specified mappings on the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>. It implements <xref:System.Xml.XPath.IXPathNavigable>, allowing scenarios where XSLT transformations can be performed over relational data retrieved from a database. For more information, see [XML Integration with Relational Data and ADO.NET](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-integration-with-relational-data-and-adonet.md).|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>|This class is optimized for <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> processing and XPath queries, and it provides a read-only high performance cache. It implements <xref:System.Xml.XPath.IXPathNavigable> and is the preferred store to use for XSLT transformations.|  \n|<xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator>|It provides navigation over XPath node sets. All XPath selection methods on the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> return an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator>. Multiple <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> objects can be created over the same store, each representing a selected set of nodes.|  \n  \n## MSXML XSLT Extensions  \n The `msxsl:script` and `msxsl:node-set` functions are the only Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) XSLT extensions supported by the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example loads an XSLT style sheet, reads a file called mydata.xml into an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>, and performs a transformation on the data on a fictitious file called myStyleSheet.xsl, sending the formatted output to the console.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \nImports System.Xml.XPath  \nImports System.Xml.Xsl  \n  \nPublic Class Sample  \n    Private filename As [String] = \"mydata.xml\"  \n    Private stylesheet As [String] = \"myStyleSheet.xsl\"  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n        Dim xslt As New XslTransform()  \n        xslt.Load(stylesheet)  \n        Dim xpathdocument As New XPathDocument(filename)  \n        Dim writer As New XmlTextWriter(Console.Out)  \n        writer.Formatting = Formatting.Indented  \n  \n        xslt.Transform(xpathdocument, Nothing, writer, Nothing)  \n    End Sub 'Main  \nEnd Class 'Sample  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.IO;  \nusing System.Xml;  \nusing System.Xml.XPath;  \nusing System.Xml.Xsl;  \n  \npublic class Sample   \n{  \n    private const String filename = \"mydata.xml\";  \n    private const String stylesheet = \"myStyleSheet.xsl\";  \n  \n    public static void Main()   \n    {  \n    XslTransform xslt = new XslTransform();  \n    xslt.Load(stylesheet);  \n    XPathDocument xpathdocument = new  \n    XPathDocument(filename);  \n    XmlTextWriter writer = new XmlTextWriter(Console.Out);  \n    writer.Formatting=Formatting.Indented;  \n  \n    xslt.Transform(xpathdocument, null, writer, null);      \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform>   \n [XslTransform Class Implements the XSLT Processor](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xsltransform-class-implements-the-xslt-processor.md)   \n [Implementation of Discretionary Behaviors in the XslTransform Class](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/implementation-of-discretionary-behaviors-in-the-xsltransform-class.md)   \n [XPathNavigator in Transformations](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xpathnavigator-in-transformations.md)   \n [XPathNodeIterator in Transformations](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xpathnodeiterator-in-transformations.md)   \n [XPathDocument Input to XslTransform](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xpathdocument-input-to-xsltransform.md)   \n [XmlDataDocument Input to XslTransform](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xmldatadocument-input-to-xsltransform.md)   \n [XmlDocument Input to XslTransform](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xmldocument-input-to-xsltransform.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,415],"nodes":[{"content":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,65]}]}],"pos":[6,74],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\n  - \"CSharp\"\n  - \"C++\"\n  - \"jsharp\"\nms.assetid: 500335af-f9b5-413b-968a-e6d9a824478c\ncaps.latest.revision: 4\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[422,470],"content":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class","linkify":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class","nodes":[{"content":"XSLT Transformations with the XslTransform Class","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[473,1020],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> class is obsolete in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnext](../../../../includes/dnprdnext-md.md)].
