These include:\n\n- Support for dynamic DPI scenarios in which the user changes the DPI or scale factor after a Windows Forms application has been launched.\n\n- Improvements in the scaling and layout of a number of Windows Forms controls, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> control. \n\nHigh DPI awareness is an opt-in feature; by default, the value of `DpiAwareness` is `false. You can opt into Windows Forms' support for DPI awareness by setting the value of this key to `PerMonitorV2` in the application configuration file. If DPI awareness is enabled, all individual DPI features are also enabled. These include:\n\n- DPI changed messages, which are controlled by the `DisableDpiChangedMessageHandling` key.\n\n- Dynamic DPI support, which is controlled by the `EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing` key.\n\n- Single-pass control scaling, which is controlled by the `Form.DisableSinglePassControlScaling` for individual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> controls, by the `AnchorLayout.DisableSinglePassControlScaling` key for anchored controls, and by the `MonthCalendar.DisableSinglePassControlScaling` key for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control \n\n- High DPI scaling and layout improvements, which is controlled by the `CheckListBox.DisableHighDpiImprovements` key for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> control, by the `DataGridView.DisableHighDpiImprovements` key for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, and by the `Toolstrip.DisableHighDpiImprovements` key for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control.  \n\nThe single default opt-in setting provided by setting `DpiAwareness` to `PerMonitorV2` is generally adequate for new Windows Forms applications. However, You can then opt out of individual high DPI improvements by adding the corresponding key to the application configuration file. For example, to take advantage of all the new DPI featuers except for dynamic DPI support, you would add the following to your application configuration file:\n\n```xml\n<System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>\n   <add key=\"DpiAwareness\" value=\"PerMonitorV2\" />\n   <--! Disable dynamic DPI support -->\n   <add key=\"EnableWindowsFormsHighDpiAutoResizing\" value=\"false\" />\n</System.Windows.Forms.ApplicationConfigurationSection>\n```\nTypically, you opt out of a particular feature because you've chosen to handle it programmatically.\n\nFor more information on taking advantage of High DPI support in Windows Forms applications, see [High DPI Support in Windows Forms](../../../../../docs/framework/winforms/high-dpi-support-in-windows-forms.md).\n \n### DisableDpiChangedMessageHandling\n\nStarting with the .NET Framework 4.7, Windows Forms controls raise a number of events related to changes in DPI scaling. These include the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DpiChangedAfterParent>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DpiChangedBeforeParent>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.DpiChanged> events. The value of the `DisableDpiChangedMessageHandling` key determines whether these events are raised in a Windows Forms application. \n\n### Single-pass scaling\n\nSingle or multi-pass scaling influences the perceived responsiveness of the user interface and the the visual appearance of user interface elements as they are scaled. Starting with the .NET Framework 4.7, Windows Forms uses single pass scaling. In previous versions of the .NET Framework, scaling was performed through multiple passes, which caused some controls to be scaled more than was necessary. Single-pass scaling should only be disabled if your app depends on the old behavior.  \n\n## See also\n \n[Windows Forms Configuration Section](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/winforms/index.md)   \n[High DPI Support in Windows Forms](../../../../../docs/framework/winforms/high-dpi-support-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Windows Forms Add Configuration Element | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Windows Forms Add Configuration Element | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[452,491],"content":"Windows Forms Add Configuration Element","linkify":"Windows Forms Add Configuration Element","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Forms Add Configuration Element","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[493,661],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`&lt;add&gt;`</ph> element adds a predefined key that specifies whether your Windows Form app supports features added to Windows Forms apps in the .NET Framework 4.7 or later.","source":"The `<add>` element adds a predefined key that specifies whether your Windows Form app supports features added to Windows Forms apps in the .NET Framework 4.7 or later."},{"pos":[666,672],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[843,866],"content":"Attributes and elements","linkify":"Attributes and elements","nodes":[{"content":"Attributes and elements","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.","pos":[868,948]},{"pos":[954,964],"content":"Attributes","linkify":"Attributes","nodes":[{"content":"Attributes","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"Attribute","pos":[968,977]},{"content":"Description","pos":[980,991]},{"content":"Required attribute.","pos":[1036,1055]},{"content":"A predefined key name that corresponds to a particular Windows Forms customizable feature.","pos":[1056,1146]},{"content":"Required attribute.","pos":[1163,1182]},{"content":"The value to assign to <ph id=\"ph1\">`key`</ph>.","pos":[1183,1212],"source":" The value to assign to `key`."},{"pos":[1220,1263],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`key`</ph> attribute names and associated values","linkify":"`key` attribute names and associated values","source":"`key` attribute names and associated values"},{"pos":[1267,1277],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`key`</ph> name","source":"`key` name"},{"content":"Values","pos":[1280,1286]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1289,1300]},{"content":"\"AnchorLayout.DisableSinglePassControlScaling\"","pos":[1343,1389]},{"content":"\"true\"&amp;#124;\"false\"","pos":[1392,1411],"source":"\"true\"&#124;\"false\""},{"content":"Indicates whether anchored controls are scaled in a single pass.","pos":[1414,1478]},{"content":"\"true\" to disable single pass scaling;
