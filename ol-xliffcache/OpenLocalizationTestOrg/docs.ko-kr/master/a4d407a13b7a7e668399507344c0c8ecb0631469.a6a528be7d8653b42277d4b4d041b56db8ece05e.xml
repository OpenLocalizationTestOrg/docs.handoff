Modifying an element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property can cause [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] to create a temporary surface.  \n  \n<a name=\"Navigation_Objects\"></a>   \n## Navigation to Object  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> object derives from <xref:System.Windows.Window> and extends it with content navigation support, primarily by aggregating <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> and the journal. You can update the client area of <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> by specifying either a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] or an object. The following sample shows both methods:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Performance#PerformanceSnippet14](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Performance/CSharp/TestNavigation.xaml.cs#performancesnippet14)]\n [!code-vb[Performance#PerformanceSnippet14](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Performance/visualbasic/testnavigation.xaml.vb#performancesnippet14)]  \n  \n Each <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> object has a journal that records the user's navigation history in that window. One of the purposes of the journal is to allow users to retrace their steps.  \n  \n When you navigate using a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)], the journal stores only the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] reference. This means that each time you revisit the page, it is dynamically reconstructed, which may be time consuming depending on the complexity of the page. In this case, the journal storage cost is low, but the time to reconstitute the page is potentially high.  \n  \n When you navigate using an object, the journal stores the entire visual tree of the object. This means that each time you revisit the page, it renders immediately without having to be reconstructed. In this case, the journal storage cost is high, but the time to reconstitute the page is low.  \n  \n When you use the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> object, you will need to keep in mind how the journaling support impacts your application's performance. For more information, see [Navigation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/navigation-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Hit_Testing\"></a>   \n## Hit Testing on Large 3D Surfaces  \n Hit testing on large 3D surfaces is a very performance intensive operation in terms of CPU consumption. This is especially true when the 3D surface is animating. If you do not require hit testing on these surfaces, then disable hit testing. Objects that are derived from <xref:System.Windows.UIElement> can disable hit testing by setting the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.IsHitTestVisible%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n<a name=\"CompositionTarget_Rendering_Event\"></a>   \n## CompositionTarget.Rendering Event  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Media.CompositionTarget.Rendering?displayProperty=fullName> event causes [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] to continuously animate. If you use this event, detach it at every opportunity.  \n  \n<a name=\"Avoid_Using_ScrollBarVisibility\"></a>   \n## Avoid Using ScrollBarVisibility=Auto  \n Whenever possible, avoid using the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility?displayProperty=fullName> value for the `HorizontalScrollBarVisibility` and `VerticalScrollBarVisibility` properties. These properties are defined for <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> objects, and as an attached property for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> object. Instead, set <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility> to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility>, or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility> value is intended for cases when space is limited and scrollbars should only be displayed when necessary. For example, it may be useful to use this <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollBarVisibility> value with a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> of 30 items as opposed to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> with hundreds of lines of text.  \n  \n<a name=\"FontCache\"></a>   \n## Configure Font Cache Service to Reduce Start-up Time  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] Font Cache service shares font data between [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications. The first [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application you run starts this service if the service is not already running. If you are using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winvista](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winvista-md.md)], you can set the \"[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] Font Cache 3.0.0.0\" service from \"Manual\" (the default) to \"Automatic (Delayed Start)\" to reduce the initial start-up time of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Planning for Application Performance](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/planning-for-application-performance.md)   \n [Taking Advantage of
