You can use these instructions to display a picture on the main part of a tab page. For information about adding an icon to the label part of a tab page, see [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms TabControl](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-tabcontrol.md).  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> control.
