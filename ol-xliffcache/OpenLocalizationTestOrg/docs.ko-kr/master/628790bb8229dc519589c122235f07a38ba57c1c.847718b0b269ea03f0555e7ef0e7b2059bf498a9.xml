An RCW that is in use cannot be released.  \n  \n## Resolution  \n Do not free an RCW that could be in use either in the current or in other threads.  \n  \n## Effect on the Runtime  \n This MDA has no effect on the CLR.  \n  \n## Output  \n A message describing the error.  \n  \n## Configuration  \n  \n```xml  \n<mdaConfig>  \n  <assistants>  \n    <raceOnRCWCleanup/>  \n  </assistants>  \n</mdaConfig>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute>\n- [Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)\n- [Interop Marshaling](../../../docs/framework/interop/interop-marshaling.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,354],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"RCW\"\n  - \"managed debugging assistants (MDAs), RCWs\"\n  - \"race on RCW cleanup\"\n  - \"MDAs (managed debugging assistants), RCWs\"\n  - \"RaceOnRCWCleanup MDA\"\n  - \"runtime callable wrappers\"\nms.assetid: bee1e9b1-50a8-4c89-9cd9-7dd6b2458187\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"","nodes":[{"content":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","nodes":[{"content":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[361,381],"content":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","linkify":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","nodes":[{"content":"raceOnRCWCleanup MDA","pos":[0,20]}]},{"pos":[382,774],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`raceOnRCWCleanup`</ph> managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when the common language runtime (CLR) detects that a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Runtime Callable Wrapper<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/interop/runtime-callable-wrapper.md)</ept> (RCW) is in use when a call to release it is made using a command such as the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> method.","source":"The `raceOnRCWCleanup` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when the common language runtime (CLR) detects that a [Runtime Callable Wrapper](../../../docs/framework/interop/runtime-callable-wrapper.md) (RCW) is in use when a call to release it is made using a command such as the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method."},{"pos":[783,791],"content":"Symptoms","linkify":"Symptoms","nodes":[{"content":"Symptoms","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[795,957],"content":"Access violations or memory corruption during or after freeing an RCW using <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A&gt;</ph> or a similar method.","source":"Access violations or memory corruption during or after freeing an RCW using <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.ReleaseComObject%2A> or a similar method."},{"pos":[966,971],"content":"Cause","linkify":"Cause","nodes":[{"content":"Cause","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"The RCW is in use on another thread or on the freeing thread stack.","pos":[975,1042]},{"content":"An RCW that is in use cannot be released.","pos":[1044,1085]},{"pos":[1094,1104],"content":"Resolution","linkify":"Resolution","nodes":[{"content":"Resolution","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"Do not free an RCW that could be in use either in the current or in other threads.","pos":[1108,1190]},{"pos":[1199,1220],"content":"Effect on the Runtime","linkify":"Effect on the Runtime","nodes":[{"content":"Effect on the Runtime","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"This MDA has no effect on the CLR.","pos":[1224,1258]},{"pos":[1267,1273],"content":"Output","linkify":"Output","nodes":[{"content":"Output","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"A message describing the error.","pos":[1277,1308]},{"pos":[1317,1330],"content":"Configuration","linkify":"Configuration","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration","pos":[0,13]}]},{"pos":[1447,1455],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1518,1671],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)</ept>","source":"[Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)"},{"pos":[1674,1749],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Interop Marshaling<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/interop/interop-marshaling.md)</ept>","source":"[Interop Marshaling](../../../docs/framework/interop/interop-marshaling.md)"}]}
