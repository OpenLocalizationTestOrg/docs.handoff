This can be inconvenient if the columns are widely separated in the control, especially if users must scroll back and forth horizontally in order to see all the columns they are interested in. You can make the task of comparing column values easier by enabling your users to reorder the columns. When you enable column reordering, users can move a column to a new position by dragging the column header with the mouse.  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To enable column reordering  \n  \n-   Click the smart tag glyph (![Smart Tag Glyph](./media/vs-winformsmttagglyph.gif \"VS_WinFormSmtTagGlyph\")) on the upper-right corner of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, and then select **Enable Column Reordering**.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToOrderColumns%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [How to: Freeze Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](freeze-columns-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)\n- [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)\n- [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,366],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], column order\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, columns\"\n  - \"columns [Windows Forms], reordering\"\n  - \"data [Windows Forms], displaying\"\nms.assetid: d82bd69c-6799-4439-a32c-91139c5901d1","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,93],"content":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,93]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[373,466],"content":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,93]}]},{"content":"When viewing data displayed in a Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> control, users sometimes want to compare the values in specific columns.","pos":[467,627],"source":"When viewing data displayed in a Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, users sometimes want to compare the values in specific columns."},{"content":"This can be inconvenient if the columns are widely separated in the control, especially if users must scroll back and forth horizontally in order to see all the columns they are interested in.","pos":[628,820]},{"content":"You can make the task of comparing column values easier by enabling your users to reorder the columns.","pos":[821,923]},{"content":"When you enable column reordering, users can move a column to a new position by dragging the column header with the mouse.","pos":[924,1046]},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1053,1194],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Forms application project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1195,1455],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1463,1808],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
