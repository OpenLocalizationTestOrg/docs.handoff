Each operation has an individual instance. That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract. The object instances are named using the following pattern:  \n  \n```  \n(ServiceName).(ContractName).(OperationName)@(first endpoint listener address)  \n```  \n  \n This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Performance Counters](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/performance-counters/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"Operation Performance Counters | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Operation Performance Counters | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[357,387],"content":"Operation Performance Counters","linkify":"Operation Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Operation Performance Counters","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Operation performance counters are found under the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0`</ph> performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe).","pos":[388,546],"source":"Operation performance counters are found under the `ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe)."},{"content":"Each operation has an individual instance.","pos":[547,589]},{"content":"That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract.","pos":[590,703]},{"content":"The object instances are named using the following pattern:","pos":[704,763]},{"content":"This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.","pos":[866,970]},{"pos":[978,1298],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name.
