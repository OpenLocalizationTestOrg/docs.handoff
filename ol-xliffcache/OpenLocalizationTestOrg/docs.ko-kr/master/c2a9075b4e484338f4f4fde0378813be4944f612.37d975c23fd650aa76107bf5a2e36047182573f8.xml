To add a new row, declare a new variable as type <xref:System.Data.DataRow>. A new **DataRow** object is returned when you call the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.NewRow%2A> method. The **DataTable** then creates the **DataRow** object based on the structure of the table, as defined by the <xref:System.Data.DataColumnCollection>.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates how to create a new row by calling the **NewRow** method.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim workRow As DataRow = workTable.NewRow()  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataRow workRow = workTable.NewRow();  \n```  \n  \n You then can manipulate the newly added row using an index or the column name, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nworkRow(\"CustLName\") = \"Smith\"  \nworkRow(1) = \"Smith\"  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nworkRow[\"CustLName\"] = \"Smith\";  \nworkRow[1] = \"Smith\";  \n```  \n  \n After data is inserted into the new row, the **Add** method is used to add the row to the <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection>, shown in the following code.  \n  \n```vb  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(workRow)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(workRow);  \n```  \n  \n You can also call the **Add** method to add a new row by passing in an array of values, typed as <xref:System.Object>, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(new Object() {1, \"Smith\"})  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(new Object[] {1, \"Smith\"});  \n```  \n  \n Passing an array of values, typed as **Object**, to the **Add** method creates a new row inside the table and sets its column values to the values in the object array. Note that values in the array are matched sequentially to the columns, based on the order in which they appear in the table.  \n  \n The following example adds 10 rows to the newly created **Customers** table.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim workRow As DataRow  \nDim i As Integer  \n  \nFor i = 0 To 9  \n  workRow = workTable.NewRow()  \n  workRow(0) = i  \n  workRow(1) = \"CustName\" & I.ToString()  \n  workTable.Rows.Add(workRow)  \nNext  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataRow workRow;  \n  \nfor (int i = 0; i <= 9; i++)   \n{  \n  workRow = workTable.NewRow();  \n  workRow[0] = i;  \n  workRow[1] = \"CustName\" + i.ToString();  \n  workTable.Rows.Add(workRow);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Data.DataColumnCollection>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataRow>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataTable>   \n [Manipulating Data in a DataTable](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/manipulating-data-in-a-datatable.md)   \n [ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,357],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Adding Data to a DataTable | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
