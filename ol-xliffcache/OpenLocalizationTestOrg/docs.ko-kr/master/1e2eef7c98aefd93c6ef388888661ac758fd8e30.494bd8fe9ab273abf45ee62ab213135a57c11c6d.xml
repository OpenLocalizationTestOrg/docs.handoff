Both expressions must have implicitly convertible data types.  \n  \n## Result Types  \n `true` if the left expression has a value greater than or equal to the right expression; otherwise, `false`.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses >= comparison operator to compare two expressions to determine whether the left expression has a value greater than or equal to the right expression. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  \n  \n2.
