A user-defined equality or inequality operator implies that you also want to override the **GetHashCode** function.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0661:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0661.cs  \n// compile with: /W:3  \nclass Test   // CS0661  \n{  \n   public static bool operator == (object o, Test t)  \n   {  \n      return true;  \n   }  \n  \n   public static bool operator != (object o, Test t)  \n   {  \n      return true;  \n   }  \n  \n   public override bool Equals(object o)  \n   {  \n      return true;  \n   }  \n  \n   // uncomment the GetHashCode function to resolve  \n   // public override int GetHashCode()  \n   // {  \n   //    return 0;  \n   // }  \n  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0661\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0661\"\nms.assetid: c218665e-5947-40bb-b633-d268483e6522","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0661","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"'class' defines operator == or operator != but does not override Object.GetHashCode()","pos":[218,303]},{"content":"The compiler detected the user-defined equality or inequality operator, but no override for the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>GetHashCode<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> function.","pos":[310,431],"source":"The compiler detected the user-defined equality or inequality operator, but no override for the **GetHashCode** function."},{"content":"A user-defined equality or inequality operator implies that you also want to override the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>GetHashCode<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> function.","pos":[432,547],"source":" A user-defined equality or inequality operator implies that you also want to override the **GetHashCode** function."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0661:","pos":[554,592]}]}
