For example, consider the transformation where the red component is increased by one half the value of the blue component. Under such a transformation, the color (0.2, 0.5, 1) would become (0.7, 0.5, 1). The new red component is 0.2 + (1/2)(1) = 0.7.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from the file ColorBars4.bmp. Then the code applies the shearing transformation described in the preceding paragraph to each pixel in the image.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the original image on the left and the sheared image on the right: \n  \n ![Two squares with colored stripes side-by-side illustrating the original image and the sheared image.](./media/how-to-shear-colors/original-image-sheared-image.png)  \n  \n The following table lists the color vectors for the four bars before and after the shearing transformation.  \n  \n|Original|Sheared|  \n|--------------|-------------|  \n|(0, 0, 1, 1)|(0.5, 0, 1, 1)|  \n|(0.5, 1, 0.5, 1)|(0.75, 1, 0.5, 1)|  \n|(1, 1, 0, 1)|(1, 1, 0, 1)|  \n|(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 1)|(0.6, 0.4, 0.4, 1)|  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Misc3#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Misc3/CS/Form1.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Misc3#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Misc3/VB/Form1.vb#9)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.
