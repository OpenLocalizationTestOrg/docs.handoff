The following classes and methods are typically used to write text to a file:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> - it contains methods to write to a file synchronously (<xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.Write%2A> or <xref:System.IO.TextWriter.WriteLine%2A>) or asynchronously (<xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.WriteAsync%2A> and <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.WriteLineAsync%2A>).  \n  \n-   <xref:System.IO.File> – to be used with .NET Framework applications. It provides static methods to write text to a file such as <xref:System.IO.File.WriteAllLines%2A> and <xref:System.IO.File.WriteAllText%2A>, or to append text to a file (<xref:System.IO.File.AppendAllLines%2A>, <xref:System.IO.File.AppendAllText%2A> or <xref:System.IO.File.AppendText%2A>).  \n  \n-   [FileIO](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.fileio.aspx) - to be used with [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps. It contains asynchronous methods to write text to a file ([WriteLinesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.fileio.writelinesasync.aspx) or [WriteTextAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.fileio.writetextasync.aspx)) or to append text to a file ([AppendLinesAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.fileio.appendlinesasync.aspx) or [AppendTextAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.fileio.appendtextasync.aspx)).  \n  \n The samples have been kept simple in order to focus on the task being performed. For this reason, the samples perform minimal error checking and exception handling, if any. A real-world application generally provides more robust error checking and exception handling.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to synchronously write text to a new file using the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> class, one line at a time. The new text file is saved to the user's My Documents folder. Because the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> object is declared and instantiated in a `using` statement, the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.Dispose%2A> method is invoked which automatically flushes and closes the stream.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteLine](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/cs/source.cs#writeline)] \n [!code-vb[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteLine](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/vb/source.vb#writeline)]   \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to append text to an existing file using the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> class. It uses the same text file from the previous example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#AppendText](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/cs/source.cs#appendtext)] \n [!code-vb[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#AppendText](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/vb/source.vb#appendtext)]     \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to asynchronously write text to a new file using the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> class. In order to invoke the <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.WriteAsync%2A> method, the method call needs to be within an `async` method. The new text file is saved to the user's My Documents folder.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteAsync](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/cs/source.cs#writeasync)] \n [!code-vb[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteAsync](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/vb/source.vb#writeasync)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to write text to a new file and append new lines of text to the same file using the <xref:System.IO.File> class. The <xref:System.IO.File.WriteAllText%2A> and <xref:System.IO.File.AppendAllLines%2A> methods open and close the file automatically. If the path you provide to the <xref:System.IO.File.WriteAllText%2A> method already exists, the file will be overwritten.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteFile](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/cs/source.cs#writefile)] \n [!code-vb[Conceptual.BasicIO.TextFiles#WriteFile](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.basicio.textfiles/vb/source.vb#writefile)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to asynchronously write user input to a text file in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app. Because of security considerations, opening a file from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app typically requires the use of a [FileOpenPicker](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.pickers.fileopenpicker.aspx) control. In this example, the `FileOpenPicker` is filtered to show text files.  \n  \n```xaml  \n<Page  \n    x:Class=\"OpenFileWindowsStore.MainPage\"  \n
