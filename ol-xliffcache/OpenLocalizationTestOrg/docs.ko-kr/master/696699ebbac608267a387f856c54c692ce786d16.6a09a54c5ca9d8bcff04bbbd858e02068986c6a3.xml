This is especially true if you are authoring a custom designer for your custom control. For details, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Forms Control That Takes Advantage of Visual Studio Design-Time Features](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/creating-a-wf-control-design-time-features.md).  \n  \n You can debug your custom controls using Visual Studio, just as you would debug any other .NET Framework classes. The difference is that you will debug a separate instance of Visual Studio that is running your custom control's code  \n  \n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  \n  \n-   Creating a Windows Forms project to host your custom control  \n  \n-   Creating a control library project  \n  \n-   Adding a property to your custom control  \n  \n-   Adding your custom control to the host form  \n  \n-   Setting up the project for design-time debugging  \n  \n-   Debugging your custom control at design time  \n  \n When you are finished, you will have an understanding of the tasks necessary for debugging the design-time behavior of a custom control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the application project. You will use this project to build the application that hosts the custom control.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a Windows Application project called \"DebuggingExample\". For details, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  \n  \n## Creating a Control Library Project  \n The next step is to create the control library project and set up the custom control.  \n  \n#### To create the control library project  \n  \n1.  Add a **Windows Control Library** project to the solution.  \n  \n2.  Add a new **UserControl** item to the DebugControlLibrary project. For details, see [NIB:How to: Add New Project Items](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/63d3e16b-de6e-4bb5-a0e3-ecec762201ce). Give the new source file a base name of \"DebugControl\".  \n  \n3.  Using the **Solution Explorer**, delete the project's default control by deleting the code file with a base name of \"`UserControl1`\". For details, see [NIB:How to: Remove, Delete, and Exclude Items](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6dffdc86-29c8-4eff-bcd8-e3a0dd9e9a73).  \n  \n4.  Build the solution.  \n  \n## Checkpoint  \n At this point, you will be able to see your custom control in the **Toolbox**.  \n  \n#### To check your progress  \n  \n-   Find the new tab called **DebugControlLibrary Components** and click to select it. When it opens, you will see your control listed as **DebugControl** with the default icon beside it.  \n  \n## Adding a Property to Your Custom Control  \n To demonstrate that your custom control's code is running at design-time, you will add a property and set a breakpoint in the code that implements the property.  \n  \n#### To add a property to your custom control  \n  \n1.  Open **DebugControl** in the **Code Editor**. Add the following code to the class definition:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private demoStringValue As String = Nothing  \n    <BrowsableAttribute(true)>  \n    Public Property DemoString() As String  \n  \n        Get  \n            Return Me.demoStringValue  \n        End Get  \n  \n        Set(ByVal value As String)  \n            Me.demoStringValue = value  \n        End Set  \n  \n    End Property  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private string demoStringValue = null;  \n    [Browsable(true)]  \n    public string DemoString  \n    {  \n        get  \n        {  \n            return this.demoStringValue;  \n        }  \n        set  \n        {  \n            demoStringValue = value;  \n        }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Build the solution.  \n  \n## Adding Your Custom Control to the Host Form  \n To debug the design-time behavior of your custom control, you will place an instance of the custom control class on a host form.  \n  \n#### To add your custom control to the host form  \n  \n1.  In the \"DebuggingExample\" project, open Form1 in the **Windows Forms Designer**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, open the **DebugControlLibrary Components** tab and drag a **DebugControl** instance onto the form.  \n  \n3.  Find the `DemoString` custom property in the **Properties** window. Note that you can change its value as you would any other property. Also note that when the `DemoString` property is selected, the property's description string appears at the bottom of the **Properties** window.  \n  \n## Setting Up the Project for Design-Time Debugging  \n To debug your custom control's design-time behavior, you will debug a separate instance of Visual Studio that is running your custom control's code.  \n  \n#### To set up the project for design-time debugging  \n  \n1.  Right-click on the **DebugControlLibrary** project in the **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In the **DebugControlLibrary** property sheet, select the **Debug** tab.  \n  \n     In the **Start Action** section, select **Start external program**. You will be debugging a separate instance of Visual Studio, so click the ellipsis (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) button to browse for the Visual Studio IDE. The name of the executable file is **devenv.exe**, and if you installed to the default location, its path is %programfiles%\\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exe.  \n  \n3.  Click **OK** to close the dialog box.  \n  \n4.  Right-click the **DebugControlLibrary** project and select **Set as StartUp Project** to enable this debugging configuration.  \n  \n## Debugging Your Custom Control at Design Time  \n Now you are ready to debug your custom control as it runs in design mode. When you start the debugging session, a new instance of Visual Studio will be created, and you will use it to load the \"DebuggingExample\" solution. When you open Form1 in the **Forms Designer**, an instance of your custom control will be created and will start running.  \n  \n#### To debug your custom control at design time  \n  \n1.  Open the **DebugControl** source file in the **Code Editor** and place a breakpoint on the `Set` accessor of the `DemoString` property.  \n  \n2.  Press F5 to start the debugging session. Note that a new instance of Visual Studio is created. You can distinguish between the instances in two ways:  \n  \n    -   The debugging instance has the word **Running** in its title bar  \n  \n    -   The debugging instance has the **Start** button on its **Debug** toolbar disabled  \n  \n     Your breakpoint is set in the debugging instance.  \n  \n3.  In the new instance of Visual Studio, open the \"DebuggingExample\" solution. You can easily find the solution by selecting **Recent Projects** from the **File** menu. The \"DebuggingExample.sln\" solution file will be listed as the most recently used file.  \n  \n4.  Open Form1 in the **Forms Designer** and select the **DebugControl** control.  \n  \n5.  Change the value of the `DemoString` property. Note that when you commit the change, the debugging instance of Visual Studio acquires focus and execution stops at your breakpoint. You can single-step through the property accessor just as your would any other code.  \n  \n6.  When you are finished with your debugging session, you can exit by dismissing the hosted instance of Visual Studio or by clicking the **Stop Debugging** button in the debugging instance.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n Now that you can debug your custom controls at design time, there are many possibilities for expanding your control's interaction with the Visual Studio IDE.  \n  \n-   You can use the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component.DesignMode%2A> property of the <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component> class to write code that will only execute at design time. For details, see <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component.DesignMode%2A>.  \n  \n-   There are several attributes you can apply to your control's properties to manipulate your custom control's interaction with the designer. You can find these attributes in the <xref:System.ComponentModel?displayProperty=fullName> namespace.  \n  \n-   You can write a custom designer for your custom control. This gives you complete control over the design experience using the extensible designer infrastructure exposed by Visual Studio.
