The color matrix entries that represent scaling are given in the following table.  \n  \n|Component to be scaled|Matrix entry|  \n|----------------------------|------------------|  \n|Red|[0][0]|  \n|Green|[1][1]|  \n|Blue|[2][2]|  \n|Alpha|[3][3]|  \n  \n## Scaling One Color  \n The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from the file ColorBars2.bmp. Then the code scales the blue component of each pixel in the image by a factor of 2. The original image is drawn alongside the transformed image.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.RecoloringImages#41](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.RecoloringImages/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.RecoloringImages#41](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.RecoloringImages/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the original image on the left and the scaled image on the right:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that compares the original and scaled colors.](./media/using-transformations-to-scale-colors/four-bar-scale-one-color.png)  \n  \n The following table lists the color vectors for the four bars before and after the blue scaling. Note that the blue component in the fourth color bar went from 0.8 to 0.6. That is because [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] retains only the fractional part of the result. For example, (2)(0.8) = 1.6, and the fractional part of 1.6 is 0.6. Retaining only the fractional part ensures that the result is always in the interval [0, 1].  \n  \n|Original|Scaled|  \n|--------------|------------|  \n|(0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 1)|(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1)|  \n|(0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 1)|(0.4, 0.2, 0.4, 1)|  \n|(0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 1)|(0.2, 0.4, 0.4, 1)|  \n|(0.4, 0.4, 0.8, 1)|(0.4, 0.4, 0.6, 1)|  \n  \n## Scaling Multiple Colors  \n The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from the file ColorBars2.bmp. Then the code scales the red, green, and blue components of each pixel in the image. The red components are scaled down 25 percent, the green components are scaled down 35 percent, and the blue components are scaled down 50 percent.  \n  \n
