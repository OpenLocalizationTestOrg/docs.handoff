You can replace the string with another hard-coded string, with a `String` variable, or with a method that returns a string, such as `InputBox`.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n Use this method to validate the string before trying to convert the `String` to a `DateTime` variable. By checking the date or time first, you can avoid generating an exception at run time.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Information.IsDate%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction.InputBox%2A>\n- [Validating Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,264],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"strings [Visual Basic], validating\"\n  - \"String data type [Visual Basic], validation\"\nms.assetid: ae7d4b29-3436-4032-bdbf-4650eb1c8e19","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,69],"content":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,69]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[271,340],"content":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate Strings That Represent Dates or Times (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,69]}]},{"pos":[341,455],"content":"The following code example sets a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Boolean`</ph> value that indicates whether a string represents a valid date or time.","source":"The following code example sets a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a valid date or time."},{"pos":[464,471],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[589,607],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"Replace <ph id=\"ph1\">`(\"01/01/03\")`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`\"9:30 PM\"`</ph> with the date and time you want to validate.","pos":[611,694],"source":"Replace `(\"01/01/03\")` and `\"9:30 PM\"` with the date and time you want to validate."},{"content":"You can replace the string with another hard-coded string, with a <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph> variable, or with a method that returns a string, such as <ph id=\"ph2\">`InputBox`</ph>.","pos":[695,839],"source":" You can replace the string with another hard-coded string, with a `String` variable, or with a method that returns a string, such as `InputBox`."},{"pos":[848,866],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"Use this method to validate the string before trying to convert the <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph> to a <ph id=\"ph2\">`DateTime`</ph> variable.","pos":[870,972],"source":"Use this method to validate the string before trying to convert the `String` to a `DateTime` variable."},{"content":"By checking the date or time first, you can avoid generating an exception at run time.","pos":[973,1059]},{"pos":[1068,1076],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1188,1316],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Validating Strings in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)</ept>","source":"[Validating Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)"}]}
