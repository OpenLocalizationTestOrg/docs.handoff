Since `ref` and `out` parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed. To resolve this error, remove the `readonly` keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the `readonly` field to the function. For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modified and passing the temporary as a `ref` argument, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS1649:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS1649.cs  \npublic struct Inner  \n    {  \n        public int i;  \n    }  \n  \nclass Outer  \n{  \n    public readonly Inner inner = new Inner();  \n}  \n  \nclass D  \n{  \n    static void f(ref int iref)  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n        Outer outer = new Outer();   \n        f(ref outer.inner.i);  // CS1649  \n        // Try this code instead:  \n        // int tmp = outer.inner.i;  \n        // f(ref tmp);  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1649\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1649\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1649\"\nms.assetid: 6355c7f2-157c-441d-8925-500062988636","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1649","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1649","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1649","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1649","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1649","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1649","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Members of readonly field 'identifier' cannot be passed ref or out (except in a constructor)","pos":[194,286]},{"content":"This error occurs if you pass a variable to a function that is a member of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`readonly`</ph> field as a <ph id=\"ph2\">`ref`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`out`</ph> argument.","pos":[293,416],"source":"This error occurs if you pass a variable to a function that is a member of a `readonly` field as a `ref` or `out` argument."},{"content":"Since <ph id=\"ph1\">`ref`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`out`</ph> parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed.","pos":[417,503],"source":" Since `ref` and `out` parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed."},{"content":"To resolve this error, remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`readonly`</ph> keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`readonly`</ph> field to the function.","pos":[504,638],"source":" To resolve this error, remove the `readonly` keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the `readonly` field to the function."},{"content":"For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modified and passing the temporary as a <ph id=\"ph1\">`ref`</ph> argument, as shown in the following example.","pos":[639,799],"source":" For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modified and passing the temporary as a `ref` argument, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[808,815],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1649:","pos":[819,857]}]}
