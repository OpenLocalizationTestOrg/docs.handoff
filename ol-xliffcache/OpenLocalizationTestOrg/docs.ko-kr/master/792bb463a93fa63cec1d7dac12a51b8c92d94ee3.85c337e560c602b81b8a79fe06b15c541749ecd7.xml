Note that the ordering is performed after the join. Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it. Some LINQ providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.  \n  \n## Example  \n This query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope. Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#81](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-order-the-results-of-a-join-clause_1.cs)]  \n \n## See also  \n [LINQ query expressions](index.md)   \n [orderby clause](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md)   \n [join clause](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md) ","nodes":[{"pos":[4,350],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Order the results of a join clause\"\ndescription: How to order the results of a join clause.\nkeywords: .NET, .NET Core, C#\nauthor: BillWagner\nmanager: wpickett\nms.author: wiwagn\nms.date: 12/1/2016\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: .net-core\nms.technology: .net-core-technologies\nms.devlang: dotnet\nms.assetid: a7458901-1201-4c25-b8d9-c04ca52e0eb9","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"Order the results of a join clause","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause","pos":[0,34]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"How to order the results of a join clause.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"How to order the results of a join clause.","nodes":[{"content":"How to order the results of a join clause.","pos":[0,42]}]}],"path":["description"]},{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","nodes":[{"pos":[0,19],"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","pos":[0,19]}]}],"path":["keywords"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[357,391],"content":"Order the results of a join clause","linkify":"Order the results of a join clause","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to order the results of a join operation.","pos":[392,456]},{"content":"Note that the ordering is performed after the join.","pos":[457,508]},{"content":"Although you can use an <ph id=\"ph1\">`orderby`</ph> clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it.","pos":[509,641],"source":" Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it."},{"content":"Some LINQ providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.","pos":[642,710]},{"pos":[719,726],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope.","pos":[730,844]},{"content":"Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.","pos":[845,956]},{"pos":[1096,1104],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ query expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1108,1143],"source":"[LINQ query expressions](index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>orderby clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1147,1214],"source":"[orderby clause](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>join clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md)</ept>","pos":[1218,1278],"source":"[join clause](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md)"}]}
