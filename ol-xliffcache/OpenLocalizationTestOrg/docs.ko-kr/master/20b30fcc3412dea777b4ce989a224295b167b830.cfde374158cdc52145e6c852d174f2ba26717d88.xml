For example, if you declare an event named `Event1`, the compiler generates the implicit procedures `add_Event1` and `remove_Event1`. If the base class has a member with one of these names, the event in this class should shadow the base class member.  \n  \n This message is a warning. `Shadows` is assumed by default. For more information about hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40012  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  To hide the base class member, add the `Shadows` keyword to the event declaration.  \n  \n2.  If you do not intend to hide the base class member, change the name of the event.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Event Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/event-statement.md)\n- [Shadows](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shadows.md)\n- [Shadowing in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/shadowing.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,326],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Event '<eventname>' implicitly declares '<membername>', which conflicts with a member in the base <type> '<classname>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc40012\"\n  - \"vbc40012\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC40012\"\nms.assetid: 5f14e8bd-a227-4115-af99-cd2b6fe4dc0e","nodes":[{"content":"Event '<eventname>' implicitly declares '<membername>', which conflicts with a member in the base <type> '<classname>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,165],"content":"Event '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;eventname&gt;</ph>' implicitly declares '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;membername&gt;</ph>', which conflicts with a member in the base <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;type&gt;</ph> '<ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;classname&gt;</ph>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'","source":"Event '<eventname>' implicitly declares '<membername>', which conflicts with a member in the base <type> '<classname>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[333,502],"content":"Event '\\<eventname>' implicitly declares '\\<membername>', which conflicts with a member in the base \\<type> '\\<classname>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'","linkify":"Event '\\<eventname>' implicitly declares '\\<membername>', which conflicts with a member in the base \\<type> '\\<classname>', and so the event should be declared 'Shadows'","nodes":[{"content":"Event '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>eventname&gt;' implicitly declares '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>membername&gt;', which conflicts with a member in the base <ph id=\"ph3\">\\&lt;</ph>type&gt;
