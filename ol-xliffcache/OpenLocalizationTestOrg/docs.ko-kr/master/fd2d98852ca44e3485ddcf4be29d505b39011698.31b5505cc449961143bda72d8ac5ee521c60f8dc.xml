For example, you might want several tracking records across several workflows to be tagged with \"Mail Server\" == \"Mail Server1\". This makes it easy to find all records with this tag when querying tracking records later.  \n  \n## Adding Annotations  \n An annotation can be added to a tracking query as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```xml  \n<activityStateQuery activityName=\"SendEmailActivity\">  \n  <states>  \n    <state name=\"Closed\"/>  \n  </states>  \n  <annotations>  \n    <annotation name=\"MailServer\" value=\"Mail Server1\"/>  \n  </annotations>  \n</activityStateQuery>  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  These tracking query elements can be used to create a tracking profile. A tracking profile can be created either in configuration or using code.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Tracking.Configuration.ProfileWorkflowElement>\n- <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.TrackingProfile>\n- [\\<participants>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/participants.md)\n- [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)\n- [Tracking Profiles](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,133],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using Annotation in Queries\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.topic: \"reference\"\nms.assetid: 50855b30-d5fe-49a9-89d3-3f1bfd670958","nodes":[{"content":"Using Annotation in Queries","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"Using Annotation in Queries","nodes":[{"content":"Using Annotation in Queries","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[140,167],"content":"Using Annotation in Queries","linkify":"Using Annotation in Queries","nodes":[{"content":"Using Annotation in Queries","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"Annotations allow you to arbitrarily tag tracking records with a value that can be configured after build time.","pos":[168,279]},{"content":"For example, you might want several tracking records across several workflows to be tagged with \"Mail Server\" == \"Mail Server1\".","pos":[280,408]},{"content":"This makes it easy to find all records with this tag when querying tracking records later.","pos":[409,499]},{"pos":[508,526],"content":"Adding Annotations","linkify":"Adding Annotations","nodes":[{"content":"Adding Annotations","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"An annotation can be added to a tracking query as shown in the following example.","pos":[530,611]},{"pos":[869,1024],"content":"[!NOTE]\n These tracking query elements can be used to create a tracking profile.
