Some of the methods are a part of the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] language, and others are inherent in the `String` class.  \n  \n## Visual Basic Language and the .NET Framework  \n [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] methods are used as inherent functions of the language. They may be used without qualification in your code. The following example shows typical use of a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] string-manipulation command:  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#44](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/codesnippet/VisualBasic/types-of-string-manipulation-methods_1.vb)]  \n  \n In this example, the `Mid` function performs a direct operation on `aString` and assigns the value to `bString`.  \n  \n For a list of Visual Basic string manipulation methods, see [String Manipulation Summary](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/keywords/string-manipulation-summary.md).  \n  \n### Shared Methods and Instance Methods  \n You can also manipulate strings with the methods of the `String` class. There are two types of methods in `String`: *shared* methods and *instance* methods.  \n  \n#### Shared Methods  \n A shared method is a method that stems from the `String` class itself and does not require an instance of that class to work. These methods can be qualified with the name of the class (`String`) rather than with an instance of the `String` class. For example:  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#45](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/codesnippet/VisualBasic/types-of-string-manipulation-methods_2.vb)]  \n  \n In the preceding example, the <xref:System.String.Copy%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is a static method, which acts upon an expression it is given and assigns the resulting value to `bString`.  \n  \n#### Instance Methods  \n Instance methods, by contrast, stem from a particular instance of `String` and must be qualified with the instance name. For example:  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#46](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/codesnippet/VisualBasic/types-of-string-manipulation-methods_3.vb)]  \n  \n In this example, the <xref:System.String.Substring%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is a method of the instance of `String` (that is, `aString`). It performs an operation on `aString` and assigns that value to `bString`.  \n  \n For more information, see the documentation for the <xref:System.String> class.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction
