The Settings designer is a grid-style interface that allows you to create new settings and specify properties for those settings. You must specify Name, Value, Type and Scope for your new settings. Once a setting is created, it is accessible in code.  \n  \n### To create a new setting at design time in C#  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Properties** node of your project.  \n  \n2.  Double-click the .settings file in which you want to add a new setting. The default name for this file is Settings.settings.  \n  \n3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.  \n  \n### To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project node and choose **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** page, select the **Settings** tab.  \n  \n3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)   \n [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)   \n [How To: Change the Value of an Existing Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-change-the-value-of-an-existing-setting-at-design-time.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,72],"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[540,583],"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time","linkify":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"You can create a new setting at design time by using the Settings designer.","pos":[584,659]},{"content":"The Settings designer is a grid-style interface that allows you to create new settings and specify properties for those settings.","pos":[660,789]},{"content":"You must specify Name, Value, Type and Scope for your new settings.","pos":[790,857]},{"content":"Once a setting is created, it is accessible in code.","pos":[858,910]},{"pos":[920,964],"content":"To create a new setting at design time in C#","linkify":"To create a new setting at design time in C#","nodes":[{"content":"To create a new setting at design time in C#","pos":[0,44]}]},{"pos":[974,1047],"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, expand the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> node of your project.","source":"In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Properties** node of your project."},{"content":"Double-click the .settings file in which you want to add a new setting.","pos":[1057,1128]},{"content":"The default name for this file is Settings.settings.","pos":[1129,1181]},{"content":"In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting.","pos":[1191,1271]},{"content":"Each row represents a single setting.","pos":[1272,1309]},{"pos":[1319,1373],"content":"To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic","linkify":"To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic","nodes":[{"content":"To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[1383,1465],"content":"In <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Solution Explorer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, right-click your project node and choose <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project node and choose **Properties**."},{"pos":[1475,1531],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, select the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Settings<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> tab.","source":"In the **Properties** page, select the **Settings** tab."},{"content":"In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting.","pos":[1541,1621]},{"content":"Each row represents a single setting.","pos":[1622,1659]},{"pos":[1668,1676],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Settings and User Settings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1680,1821],"source":"[Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Application Settings Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1824,1936],"source":" [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How To: Change the Value of an Existing Setting at Design Time<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-change-the-value-of-an-existing-setting-at-design-time.md)</ept>","pos":[1939,2115],"source":" [How To: Change the Value of an Existing Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-change-the-value-of-an-existing-setting-at-design-time.md)"}]}
