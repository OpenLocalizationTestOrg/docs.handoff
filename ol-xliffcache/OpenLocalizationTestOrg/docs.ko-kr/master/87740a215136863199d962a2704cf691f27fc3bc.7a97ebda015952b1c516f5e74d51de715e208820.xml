When the mouse pointer enters the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>, the background of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> is changed to red.  When the mouse pointer leaves the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>, the background of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> is changed back to white.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[mouseenterMouseleave#MouseEnterLeaveSampleEventHandlers](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseenterMouseleave/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#mouseenterleavesampleeventhandlers)]\n [!code-vb[mouseenterMouseleave#MouseEnterLeaveSampleEventHandlers](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/mouseenterMouseleave/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#mouseenterleavesampleeventhandlers)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,291],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"colors of elements [WPF], changing\"\n  - \"rollover effect [WPF]\"\n  - \"element colors [WPF], changing\"\nms.assetid: 3b20d028-6f1c-4b25-95d2-fa68cefbdb4c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[298,343],"content":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","linkify":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Rollover Effect Using Events","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to change the color of an element as the mouse pointer enters and leaves the area occupied by the element.","pos":[344,473]},{"pos":[480,605],"content":"This example consists of a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> file and a code-behind file.","source":"This example consists of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file and a code-behind file."},{"pos":[613,865],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This example demonstrates how to use events, but the recommended way to achieve this same effect is to use a <xref:System.Windows.Trigger> in a style.
