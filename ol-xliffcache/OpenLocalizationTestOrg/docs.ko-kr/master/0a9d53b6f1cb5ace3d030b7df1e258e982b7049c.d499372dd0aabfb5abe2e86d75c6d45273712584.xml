Such an object or method is called a factory. Your data source might be, for example, the return value from a method call, instead of an object in memory or a type. You can bind a control to this kind of data source as long as the source returns a collection.  \n  \n You can easily bind a control to a factory object by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a factory method by using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control. The factory method is named `GetOrdersByCustomerId`, and it returns all the orders for a given customer in the Northwind database.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory/CPP/form1.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindToFactory/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
