Identifiers must be unique within the lifetime of a process. The CLR uses this value as the unique identifier for the associated stream. It checks each value against the values for `pAssemblyId` returned by calls to [ProvideAssembly](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostassemblystore-provideassembly-method.md) and against the values for `pdwModuleId` returned by other calls to `ProvideModule`. If the host returns the same identifier value for another `IStream`, the CLR checks whether the contents of that stream have already been mapped. If so, the CLR loads the existing copy of the image instead of mapping a new one. Therefore, the identifier must also not overlap with the assembly identifiers returned from `ProvideAssembly`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework
