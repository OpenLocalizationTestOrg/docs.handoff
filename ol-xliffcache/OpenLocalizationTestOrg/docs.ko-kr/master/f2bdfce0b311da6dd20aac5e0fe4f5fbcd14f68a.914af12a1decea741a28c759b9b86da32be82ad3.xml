It shows how to execute it synchronously and asynchronously.  \n  \n## Demonstrates  \n <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>, <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>.  \n  \n## Discussion  \n The first part of the sample uses <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A>. This is the most basic way to execute a workflow. Workflows executed with <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker.Invoke%2A> are executed synchronously.  \n  \n The second part of the sample uses the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> class. <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> enables you to have more control over each instance, including the ability to interact with the running workflow and to run the workflow asynchronously.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
