They do not affect binaries that target a previous version of the .NET Framework but are running under version 4.7. The .NET Framework 4.7 includes retargeting changes in the following areas:  \n\n-   [Core](#Core)  \n-   [ASP.NET](#asp) \n-   [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)](#WCF)  \n-   [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#WPF)\n \n The Scope column in the following tables specifies the significance of each change:  \n  \n-   Major. A significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code. Note that none of the retargeting changes fall into this category.  \n  \n-   Minor. A change that either affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.  \n  \n-   Edge. A change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.  \n  \n-   Transparent. A change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user. The app should not require modification because of this change.  \n  \n## <a name=\"Core\" /> Core\n\n| Feature | Change | Impact | Scope |\n|----|----|----|----|\n|<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CspParameters.ParentWindowHandle%2A> | Applications that target the .NET Framework 4.6.2 and earlier versions expect the value assigned to this property to be an <xref:System.IntPtr> to the specified location in memory where the HWND value resides.<br/></br>Starting with apps that target the .NET Framework 4.7, a Windows Forms application can set the value of this property with code like the following: <br/><br/>` cspParameters.ParentWindowHandle = form.Handle; ` | Apps that find this change of behavior inconvenient can opt out of the new behavior. Similarly, apps that target earlier versions of the .NET Framework but are running on the .NET Framework 4.7 can opt into the new behavior.

For more information, see [Mitigation: Grid Control's Space Allocation to Star-columns](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/mitigation-grid-control.md). | Minor |\n<xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageSourceConverter.ConvertFrom%2A> | In applications that target the .NET Framework 4.6.2 and earlier versions, an error in the exception handling code for the <xref:System.Windows.Media.ImageSourceConverter.ConvertFrom%2A> method caused a <xref:System.NullReferenceException>  to be thrown instead of the intended exception (such as a <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException> or a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>.<br/><br/>Starting with apps that target the .NET Framework 4.7, the correct exception is thrown.  | Applications that target the .NET Framework 4.7 and that depend on handling a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> can restore the previous behavior by adding the following to the configuration setting to the [runtime](~/docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the `app.config` file: <br/><br/>`<runtime>`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`<AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Windows.Media.ImageSourceConverter.OverrideExceptionWithNullReferenceException=true\"/>`<br/>`</runtime>`| Edge | \n| Opt-in support for a `WM_POINTER`-based touch/stylus stack | Starting with apps that target the .NET Framework 4.7, WPF adds support for an optional `WM_POINTER-based touch.  | This is an opt-in feature that is available on Windows systems starting with Windows 10 Creators Update. WPF apps that do not explicitly opt in to pointer-based touch/stylus support are unaffected. For more information, see [Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support](../Topic/Mitigation:%20Pointer-based%20Touch%20and%20Stylus%20Support.md). | Edge |\n| <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue>
