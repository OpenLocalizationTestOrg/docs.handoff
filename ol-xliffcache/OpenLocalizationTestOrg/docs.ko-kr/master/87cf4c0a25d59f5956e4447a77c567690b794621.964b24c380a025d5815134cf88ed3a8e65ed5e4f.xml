It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to compare it with a number, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a numeric value.  \n  \n The expressions in a `Select`...`Case` construction should all be of the same data type or of closely related data types that can be converted to each other. This is because each `Case` statement compares at least one value against the test expression on which the `Select`...`Case` construction is based.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
