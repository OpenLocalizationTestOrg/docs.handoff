If not specified, duplicates are removed from the result collection.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n UNION is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. For precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators, see [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses the UNION ALL operator to combine the results of two queries into a single collection. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  \n  \n2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts
