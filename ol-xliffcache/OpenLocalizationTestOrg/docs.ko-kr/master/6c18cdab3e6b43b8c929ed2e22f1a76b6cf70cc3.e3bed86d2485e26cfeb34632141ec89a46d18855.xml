For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button?displayProperty=fullName> control raises an event when the user clicks it in the webpage. By handling the event, your application can perform the appropriate application logic for that button click.  \n  \n### To handle a button click event on a webpage  \n  \n1.  Create a ASP.NET Web Forms page (webpage) that has a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control with the `OnClick` value set to the name of method that you will define in the next step.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <asp:Button ID=\"Button1\" runat=\"server\" Text=\"Click Me\" OnClick=\"Button1_Click\" />  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Define an event handler that matches the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event delegate signature and that has the name you defined for the `OnClick` value.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n        // perform action  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Protected Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n        ' perform action  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n     The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event uses the <xref:System.EventHandler> class for the delegate type and the <xref:System.EventArgs> class for the event data. The ASP.NET page framework automatically generates code that creates an instance of <xref:System.EventHandler> and adds this delegate instance to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> instance.  \n  \n3.  In the event handler method that you defined in step 2, add code to perform any actions that are required when the event occurs.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,78],"content":"How to: Consume Events in a Web Forms Application | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Consume Events in a Web Forms Application | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]},{"pos":[592,641],"content":"How to: Consume Events in a Web Forms Application","linkify":"How to: Consume Events in a Web Forms Application","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Consume Events in a Web Forms Application","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"A common scenario in ASP.NET Web Forms applications is to populate a webpage with controls, and then perform a specific action based on which control the user clicks.","pos":[642,808]},{"content":"For example, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> control raises an event when the user clicks it in the webpage.","pos":[809,952],"source":" For example, a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button?displayProperty=fullName> control raises an event when the user clicks it in the webpage."},{"content":"By handling the event, your application can perform the appropriate application logic for that button click.","pos":[953,1061]},{"pos":[1071,1114],"content":"To handle a button click event on a webpage","linkify":"To handle a button click event on a webpage","nodes":[{"content":"To handle a button click event on a webpage","pos":[0,43]}]},{"pos":[1124,1314],"content":"Create a ASP.NET Web Forms page (webpage) that has a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button&gt;</ph> control with the <ph id=\"ph2\">`OnClick`</ph> value set to the name of method that you will define in the next step.","source":"Create a ASP.NET Web Forms page (webpage) that has a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control with the `OnClick` value set to the name of method that you will define in the next step."},{"pos":[1439,1609],"content":"Define an event handler that matches the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click&gt;</ph> event delegate signature and that has the name you defined for the <ph id=\"ph2\">`OnClick`</ph> value.","source":"Define an event handler that matches the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event delegate signature and that has the name you defined for the `OnClick` value."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click&gt;</ph> event uses the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler&gt;</ph> class for the delegate type and the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.EventArgs&gt;</ph> class for the event data.","pos":[1912,2089],"source":"The <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event uses the <xref:System.EventHandler> class for the delegate type and the <xref:System.EventArgs> class for the event data."},{"content":"The ASP.NET page framework automatically generates code that creates an instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler&gt;</ph> and adds this delegate instance to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click&gt;</ph> event of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button&gt;</ph> instance.","pos":[2090,2348],"source":" The ASP.NET page framework automatically generates code that creates an instance of <xref:System.EventHandler> and adds this delegate instance to the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event of the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> instance."},{"content":"In the event handler method that you defined in step 2, add code to perform any actions that are required when the event occurs.","pos":[2358,2486]},{"pos":[2495,2503],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2507,2555],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)"}]}
