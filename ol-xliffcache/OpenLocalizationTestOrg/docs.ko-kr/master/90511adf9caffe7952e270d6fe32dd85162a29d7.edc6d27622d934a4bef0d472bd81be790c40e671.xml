First you need to create a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object by using the bitmap constructor that takes a file name, <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.%23ctor%28System.String%29>. This constructor accepts images with several different file formats, including BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. After you have created the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object, pass that <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object from a JPEG file and then draws the bitmap with its upper-left corner at (60, 10).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the bitmap drawn at the specified location:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that shows an image at a specified position.](./media/how-to-draw-an-existing-bitmap-to-the-screen/bitmap-specified-position.png)  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#21](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)\n- [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,371],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw an Existing Bitmap to the Screen\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
