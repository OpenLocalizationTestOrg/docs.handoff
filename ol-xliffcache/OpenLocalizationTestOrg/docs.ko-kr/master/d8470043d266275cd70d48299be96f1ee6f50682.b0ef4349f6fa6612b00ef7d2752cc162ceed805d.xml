C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. The many innovations in C# enable rapid application development while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages.  \n  \n If you don't already have C#, you can acquire a version of Visual Studio that includes C# for free from the [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs) site.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Getting Started with C#](../csharp/getting-started/getting-started-with-csharp.md)  \n Introduces the features of C# for programmers who are new to the language or are new to [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], and provides a roadmap for finding Help about [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  \n  \n [Using the Visual Studio Development Environment for C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/csharp-ide/using-the-visual-studio-development-environment-for-csharp)  \n Introduces the [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../csharp/includes/csprcs_md.md)] development environment.  \n  \n [C# Programming Guide](../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)  \n Provides information and practical examples about how to use C# language constructs.  \n  \n [C# Reference](../csharp/language-reference/index.md)  \n Provides detailed reference information about C# programming concepts, keywords, types, operators, attributes, preprocessor directives, compiler switches, compiler errors, and compiler warnings.  \n  \n [C#
