For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  \n  \n This topic describes how [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] events are used by UI Automation clients.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] allows clients to subscribe to events of interest. This capability improves performance by eliminating the need to continually poll all the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] elements in the system to see if any information, structure, or state has changed.  \n  \n Efficiency is also improved by the ability to listen for events only within a defined scope. For example, a client can listen for focus change events on all [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] elements in the tree, or on just one element and its descendants.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Do not assume that all possible events are raised by a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] provider. For example, not all property changes cause events to be raised by the standard proxy providers for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n For a broader view of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] events, see [UI Automation Events Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-events-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Subscribing_to_Events\"></a>   \n## Subscribing to Events  \n Client applications subscribe to events of a particular kind by registering an event handler, using one of the following methods.  \n  \n|Method|Event Type|Event Arguments Type|Delegate Type|  \n|------------|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Automation.AddAutomationFocusChangedEventHandler%2A>|Focus change|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationFocusChangedEventArgs>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationFocusChangedEventHandler>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Automation.AddAutomationPropertyChangedEventHandler%2A>|Property change|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationPropertyChangedEventArgs>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationPropertyChangedEventHandler>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Automation.AddStructureChangedEventHandler%2A>|Structure change|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.StructureChangedEventArgs>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.StructureChangedEventHandler>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Automation.AddAutomationEventHandler%2A>|All other events, identified by an <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEvent>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEventArgs> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.WindowClosedEventArgs>|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEventHandler>|  \n  \n Before calling the method, you must create a delegate method to handle the event. If you prefer, you can handle different kinds of events in a single method, and pass this method in multiple calls to one of the methods in the table. For example, a single <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEventHandler> can be set up to handle various events differently according to the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationEventArgs.EventId%2A>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To process window-closed events, cast the argument type that is passed to the event handler as <xref:System.Windows.Automation.WindowClosedEventArgs>. Because the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] element for the window is no longer valid, you cannot use the `sender` parameter to retrieve information; use <xref:System.Windows.Automation.WindowClosedEventArgs.GetRuntimeId%2A> instead.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  If your application might receive events from its own [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)], do not use your application's [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] thread to subscribe to events, or to unsubscribe. Doing so might lead to unpredictable behavior.
