You can use the `wildCards` parameter to specify a specific pattern.  \n  \n An empty collection is returned if no matching files are found.  \n  \n You can use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.CopyFile%2A> method to copy the files to a directory.  \n  \n### To copy files with a specific pattern to a directory  \n  \n1.  Use the `GetFiles` method to return the list of files. This example returns all .rtf files in the specified directory.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#36](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbFileIOMisc/VB/Class1.vb#36)]  \n  \n2.  Use the `CopyFile` method to copy the files. This example copies the files to the directory named `testdirectory`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#88](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMyFileSystem/VB/Class1.vb#88)]  \n  \n3.  Close the `For` statement with a `Next` statement.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#89](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMyFileSystem/VB/Class1.vb#89)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example, which presents the above snippets in complete form, copies all .rtf files in the specified directory to the directory named `testdirectory`.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#37](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbFileIOMisc/VB/Class1.vb#37)]  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\\\\\.\\\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The directory does not exist (<xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   The directory points to an existing file (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).
