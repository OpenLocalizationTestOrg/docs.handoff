In particular, checks for the proper drive separator syntax (the colon) were made more correct.  \n  \n## Impact  \n These changes block some URI paths the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods previously supported.  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n To work around the problem of a previously acceptable path that is no longer supported by the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods, you can do the following:  \n  \n-   Manually remove the scheme from a URL. For example, remove `file://` from a URL.  \n  \n-   Pass the URI to a <xref:System.Uri> constructor,  and retrieve the value of the <xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property.  \n  \n-   Opt out of the new path normalization by setting the `Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling`<xref:System.AppContext> switch to `true`.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <runtime>  \n        <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling=true\" />    \n    </runtime>  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Retargeting Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-2.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,153],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: a0bb52de-d279-419d-8f23-4b12d1a3f36e\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[160,189],"content":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","linkify":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Path Colon Checks","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Starting with apps that target the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)]</ph>, a number of changes were made to support previously unsupported paths (both in terms of length and format).","pos":[190,388],"source":"Starting with apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], a number of changes were made to support previously unsupported paths (both in terms of length and format)."},{"content":"In particular, checks for the proper drive separator syntax (the colon) were made more correct.","pos":[389,484]},{"pos":[493,499],"content":"Impact","linkify":"Impact","nodes":[{"content":"Impact","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[503,712],"content":"These changes block some URI paths the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> methods previously supported.","source":"These changes block some URI paths the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods previously supported."},{"pos":[721,731],"content":"Mitigation","linkify":"Mitigation","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation","pos":[0,10]}]},{"pos":[735,1004],"content":"To work around the problem of a previously acceptable path that is no longer supported by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> methods, you can do the following:","source":"To work around the problem of a previously acceptable path that is no longer supported by the <xref:System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.Path.GetPathRoot%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods, you can do the following:"},{"content":"Manually remove the scheme from a URL.","pos":[1014,1052]},{"content":"For example, remove <ph id=\"ph1\">`file://`</ph> from a URL.","pos":[1053,1094],"source":" For example, remove `file://` from a URL."},{"pos":[1104,1253],"content":"Pass the URI to a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Uri&gt;</ph> constructor,  and retrieve the value of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> property.","source":"Pass the URI to a <xref:System.Uri> constructor,  and retrieve the value of the <xref:System.Uri.LocalPath%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property."},{"pos":[1263,1398],"content":"Opt out of the new path normalization by setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling`</ph><ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.AppContext&gt;</ph> switch to <ph id=\"ph3\">`true`</ph>.","source":"Opt out of the new path normalization by setting the `Switch.System.IO.UseLegacyPathHandling`<xref:System.AppContext> switch to `true`."},{"pos":[1560,1568],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1572,1684],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retargeting Changes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-2.md)</ept>","source":"[Retargeting Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-2.md)"}]}
