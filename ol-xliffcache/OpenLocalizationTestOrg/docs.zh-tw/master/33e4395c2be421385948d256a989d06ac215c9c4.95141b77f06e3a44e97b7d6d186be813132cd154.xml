For more information about serializing data, see [How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md).  \n  \n The class must have a public constructor without parameters.  \n  \n Only public properties and fields are deserialized.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The class being serialized does not have a public, parameterless constructor.  \n  \n-   The data in the file does not represent data from the class to be deserialized.  \n  \n-   The file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Always verify inputs, and never deserialize data from an untrusted source. The re-created object runs on a local computer with the permissions of the code that deserialized it. Verify all inputs before using the data in your application.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter>\n- [How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)\n- [Serialization (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,128],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 6ad60d96-a4d9-48e6-a8b0-d7f6f803cafa","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[135,181],"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","linkify":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[182,318],"content":"This example reads object data that was previously written to an XML file using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt;</ph> class.","source":"This example reads object data that was previously written to an XML file using the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class."},{"pos":[327,334],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1218,1236],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"Replace the file name \"c:\\temp\\SerializationOverview.xml\" with the name of the file containing the serialized data.","pos":[1240,1355]},{"content":"For more information about serializing data, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)</ept>.","pos":[1356,1557],"source":" For more information about serializing data, see [How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)."},{"content":"The class must have a public constructor without parameters.","pos":[1564,1624]},{"content":"Only public properties and fields are deserialized.","pos":[1631,1682]},{"pos":[1691,1709],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1713,1761]},{"content":"The class being serialized does not have a public, parameterless constructor.","pos":[1771,1848]},{"content":"The data in the file does not represent data from the class to be deserialized.","pos":[1858,1937]},{"pos":[1947,2002],"content":"The file does not exist (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IOException&gt;</ph>).","source":"The file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.IOException>)."},{"pos":[2011,2034],"content":".NET Framework Security","linkify":".NET Framework Security","nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Security","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Always verify inputs, and never deserialize data from an untrusted source.","pos":[2038,2112]},{"content":"The re-created object runs on a local computer with the permissions of the code that deserialized it.","pos":[2113,2214]},{"content":"Verify all inputs before using the data in your application.","pos":[2215,2275]},{"pos":[2284,2292],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2328,2479],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)"},{"pos":[2482,2572],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Serialization (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Serialization (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)"},{"pos":[2575,2644],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"}]}
