Links are provided to relevant topics where additional information is available.  \n  \n|Term|Definition|  \n|----------|----------------|  \n|association|The definition of a relationship between entity types.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Association Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c305169a-8af7-432f-9ba7-800a163aed41) and [association type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md).|  \n|association set|A logical container for instances of associations of the same type.<br /><br /> For more information, see [AssociationSet Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/512cbb75-cebe-4f3f-970d-3419deeff684) and [association set](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-set.md).|  \n|Code First|Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.<br /><br /> Note, that Code First development is part of the [Entity Framework 5.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=234900). The Entity Framework 5.0 is not part of the .NET Framework, but is built on .NET Framework 4.5. The Entity Framework 5.0 is available as the [‘Entity Framework’](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215714)[NuGet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232488) package.

Entity types may have scalar, complex, and navigation properties. Objects are instances of entity types. For more information, see [Working with Objects](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/working-with-objects.md).|  \n|EntityType|The specification for a data type that includes a key and a named set of properties and represents a top-level item in a conceptual model or storage model.<br /><br /> For more information, see [EntityType Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/19562e9f-fd70-4b59-bc15-3e289cbb6054) and [entity type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md).|  \n|explicit loading|When objects are returned by a query, related objects are not loaded at the same time.

These functions are used in place of [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] generated commands. Modification functions are defined by the `Function` element in the storage model.
