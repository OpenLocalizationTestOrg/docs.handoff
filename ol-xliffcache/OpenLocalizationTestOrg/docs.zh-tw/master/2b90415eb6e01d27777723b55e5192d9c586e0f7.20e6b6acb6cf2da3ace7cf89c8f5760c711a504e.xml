A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier. The signatures of the two methods must match.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30437  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Check the return types of the two methods and change them as necessary to match.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,242],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because they differ by their return types\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30437\"\n  - \"vbc30437\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30437\"\nms.assetid: e566ae72-c597-4b33-b70d-5d4ea879d644","nodes":[{"content":"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because they differ by their return types","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;method1&gt;</ph>' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;method2&gt;</ph>' because they differ by their return types","source":"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because they differ by their return types"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[249,332],"content":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because they differ by their return types","linkify":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because they differ by their return types","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>method1&gt;' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>method2&gt;' because they differ by their return types","pos":[0,83],"source":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because they differ by their return types"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs by its return type.","pos":[333,425]},{"content":"A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Overrides`</ph> modifier.","pos":[426,592],"source":" A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier."},{"content":"The signatures of the two methods must match.","pos":[593,638]},{"pos":[645,666],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30437","source":"**Error ID:** BC30437"},{"pos":[675,696],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check the return types of the two methods and change them as necessary to match.","pos":[706,786]},{"pos":[795,803],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[807,1013],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overriding properties and methods in derived classes<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)</ept>","source":"[Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)"}]}
