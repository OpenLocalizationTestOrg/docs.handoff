When a modifier key is pressed in combination with other keys, or with mouse clicks, your application can respond appropriately. For example, if the letter S is pressed, this may simply cause an \"s\" to appear on the screen, but if the keys CTRL+S are pressed, the current document may be saved. If you handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Modifiers%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> received by the event handler specifies which modifier keys are pressed. Alternatively, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.KeyData%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> specifies the character that was pressed as well as any modifier keys combined with a bitwise OR. However, if you are handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event or a mouse event, the event handler does not receive this information. In this case, you must use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ModifierKeys%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class. In either case, you must perform a bitwise AND of the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys> value and the value you are testing. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys> enumeration offers variations of each modifier key, so it is important that you perform the bitwise AND with the correct value. For example, the SHIFT key is represented by <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Shift>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.ShiftKey>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.RShiftKey> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.LShiftKey> The correct value to test SHIFT as a modifier key is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Shift>. Similarly, to test for CTRL and ALT as modifiers you should use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Control> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys.Alt> values, respectively.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Visual Basic programmers can also access key information through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Computer.Keyboard%2A> property  \n  \n### To determine which modifier key was pressed  \n  \n-   Use the bitwise `AND` operator with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ModifierKeys%2A> property and a value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Keys> enumeration to determine whether a particular modifier key is pressed. The following code example shows how to determine whether the SHIFT key is pressed within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event handler.  \n  \n
