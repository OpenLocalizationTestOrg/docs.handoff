The `GenerateMember` property specifies when the Windows Forms Designer generates a member variable for a component. The `Modifiers` property is the access modifier assigned to that member variable. If the value of the `GenerateMember` property is `false`, the value of the `Modifiers` property has no effect.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To specify whether a component is a member of the form  \n  \n1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, open your form.  \n  \n2.  Open the **Toolbox**, and on the form, place three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  \n  \n3.  Set the `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers` properties for each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control according to the following table.  \n  \n    |Button name|GenerateMember value|Modifiers value|  \n    |-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|  \n    |`button1`|`true`|`private`|  \n    |`button2`|`true`|`protected`|  \n    |`button3`|`false`|No change|  \n  \n4.  Build the solution.  \n  \n5.  In **Solution Explorer**, click the **Show All Files** button.  \n  \n6.  Open the **Form1** node, and in the **Code Editor**,open the **Form1.Designer.vb** or **Form1.Designer.cs** file. This file contains the code emitted by the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n7.  Find the declarations for the three buttons. The following code example shows the differences specified by the `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers` properties.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/CS/Form1.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/CS/Form1.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.GenerateMember/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  By default, the Windows Forms Designer assigns the `private` (`Friend` in Visual Basic) modifier to container controls like <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>. If your base <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> has a container control, it will not accept new children in inherited controls and forms. The solution is to change the modifier of the base container control to `protected` or `public`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button>   \n [Windows Forms Visual Inheritance](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-visual-inheritance.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Demonstrating Visual Inheritance](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-demonstrating-visual-inheritance.md)   \n [How to: Inherit Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-inherit-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,84],"content":"How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[724,779],"content":"How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties","linkify":"How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"When you place a component on a Windows Form, two properties are provided by the design environment: <ph id=\"ph1\">`GenerateMember`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Modifiers`</ph>.","pos":[780,914],"source":"When you place a component on a Windows Form, two properties are provided by the design environment: `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers`."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`GenerateMember`</ph> property specifies when the Windows Forms Designer generates a member variable for a component.","pos":[915,1031],"source":" The `GenerateMember` property specifies when the Windows Forms Designer generates a member variable for a component."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Modifiers`</ph> property is the access modifier assigned to that member variable.","pos":[1032,1113],"source":" The `Modifiers` property is the access modifier assigned to that member variable."},{"content":"If the value of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`GenerateMember`</ph> property is <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>, the value of the <ph id=\"ph3\">`Modifiers`</ph> property has no effect.","pos":[1114,1224],"source":" If the value of the `GenerateMember` property is `false`, the value of the `Modifiers` property has no effect."},{"pos":[1232,1608],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
