An enumeration, or `Enum`, is a symbolic name for a set of values. Enumerations are treated as data types, and you can use them to create sets of constants for use with variables and properties.  \n  \n## When to Use an Enumeration  \n Whenever a procedure accepts a limited set of variables, consider using an enumeration. Enumerations make for clearer and more readable code, particularly when meaningful names are used.  \n  \n The benefits of using enumerations include:  \n  \n-   Reduces errors caused by transposing or mistyping numbers.  \n  \n-   Makes it easy to change values in the future.  \n  \n-   Makes code easier to read, which means it is less likely that errors will creep into it.  \n  \n-   Ensures forward compatibility. With enumerations, your code is less likely to fail if in the future someone changes the values corresponding to the member names.  \n  \n## Naming Enumerations  \n Use a naming convention for enumeration members. When [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] encounters an enumeration member name, an exception may be thrown if other referenced type libraries contain the same name. Use a unique prefix that identifies the values from your application or component.  \n  \n When referring to a member of an enumeration, you must qualify the member name with the enumeration name or else use the `Imports` statement. For more information, see [Enumerations and Name Qualification](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/constants-enums/enumerations-and-name-qualification.md).  \n  \n## Predefined Enumerations  \n [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] provides a number of predefined enumerations, such as `FirstDayOfWeek` and `MsgBoxResul`t, to facilitate your code. For a list of these see [Constants and Enumerations](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/constants-and-enumerations.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Declare an
