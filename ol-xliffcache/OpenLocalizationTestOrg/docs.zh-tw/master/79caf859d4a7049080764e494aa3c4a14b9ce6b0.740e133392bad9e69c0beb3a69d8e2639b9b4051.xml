Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula,  \n  \n (N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,96],"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,84]}]},{"pos":[405,472],"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second.","pos":[473,546]},{"pos":[555,566],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[570,714]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[715,737]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[747,792]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[802,869]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[879,958]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[968,1056]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[1066,1100]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[1110,1219]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[1229,1282]},{"pos":[1289,1457],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula,","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula,"},{"content":"(N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","pos":[1464,1497]}]}
