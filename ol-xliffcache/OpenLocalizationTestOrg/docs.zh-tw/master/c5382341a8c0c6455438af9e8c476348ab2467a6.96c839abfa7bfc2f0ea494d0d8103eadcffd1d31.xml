Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Threads are granted processing time using a round-robin system that is partly based on a thread's priority level. `SetPriority` allows the CLR to set that thread priority level for the current task. The following `newPriority` values are supported.  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_ABOVE_NORMAL  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL  \n  \n-   THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL  \n  \n The CLR calls `SetPriority` when the value of the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Priority%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is modified by user code. A host can define its own algorithms for thread priority assignment, and is free to ignore this request.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  `SetPriority` does not report whether the thread priority level was changed. Call [IHostTask::GetPriority](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-getpriority-method.md) to determine the value of the task's thread priority level.  \n  \n Thread priority level values are defined by the Win32 `SetThreadPriority` function.
