The first operation asks if one or more of the elements are the character 'A', and the result is `true`. The second operation asks if all the elements are the character 'A', and the result is `true`.  \n  \n ![LINQ Quantifier Operations](./media/quantifier-operations/linq-quantifier-operations.png)  \n  \n The standard query operator methods that perform quantifier operations are listed in the following section.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method Name|Description|Visual Basic Query Expression Syntax|More Information|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|  \n|All|Determines whether all the elements in a sequence satisfy a condition.|`Aggregate … In … Into All(…)`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.All%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.All%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n|Any|Determines whether any elements in a sequence satisfy a condition.|`Aggregate … In … Into Any()`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Any%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Any%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n|Contains|Determines whether a sequence contains a specified element.|Not applicable.|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Contains%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Contains%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n  \n## Query Expression Syntax Examples  \n These examples use the `Aggregate` clause in Visual Basic as part of the filtering condition in a LINQ query.  \n  \n The following example uses the `Aggregate` clause and the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.All%2A> extension method to return from a collection those people whose pets are all older than a specified age.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAnyAll#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/CsLINQAnyAll/VB/AnyAll.vb#1)]  \n  \n The next example uses the `Aggregate` clause and the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Any%2A> extension method to return from a collection those people who have at least one pet that is older than a specified age.  \n  \n
