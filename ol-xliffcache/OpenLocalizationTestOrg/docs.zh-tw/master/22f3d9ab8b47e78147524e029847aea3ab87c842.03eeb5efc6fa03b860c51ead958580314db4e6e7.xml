This is accomplished through *accessors*: special methods that assign and retrieve values from the underlying data member. The [set](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor enables data members to be assigned, and the [get](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md) accessor retrieves data member values.  \n  \n This sample shows a `Person` class that has two properties: `Name` (string) and `Age` (int). Both properties provide `get` and `set` accessors, so they are considered read/write properties.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#33](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n In the previous example, the `Name` and `Age` properties are [public](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/public.md) and include both a `get` and a `set` accessor. This allows any object to read and write these properties. It is sometimes desirable, however, to exclude one of the accessors. Omitting the `set` accessor, for example, makes the property read-only:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#87](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_2.cs)]  \n  \n Alternatively, you can expose one accessor publicly but make the other private or protected. For more information, see [Asymmetric Accessor Accessibility](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/restricting-accessor-accessibility.md).  \n  \n Once the properties are declared, they can be used as if they were fields of the class. This allows for a very natural syntax when both getting and setting the value of a property, as in the following statements:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#35](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_3.cs)]  \n  \n Note that in a property `set` method a special `value` variable is available. This variable contains the value that the user specified, for example:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#36](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_4.cs)]  \n  \n Notice the clean syntax for incrementing the `Age` property on a `Person` object:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#37](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_5.cs)]  \n  \n If separate `set` and `get` methods were used to model properties, the equivalent code might look like this:  \n  \n```  \nperson.SetAge(person.GetAge() + 1);   \n```  \n  \n The `ToString` method is overridden in this example:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#38](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-declare-and-use-read-write-properties_6.cs)]  \n  \n Notice that `ToString` is not explicitly used in the program. It is invoked by default by the `WriteLine` calls.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n
