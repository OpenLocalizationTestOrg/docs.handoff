The `ReDim` statement can be used to change the size of one or more dimensions of an array that has already been formally declared, but it cannot change the rank of an array.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30415  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure that you intend the rank instead of the sizes of the array, and if possible, use `Dim` to declare a new array with the desired rank.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ReDim Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)\n- [Dim Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)\n- [Arrays in Visual Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,219],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30415\"\n  - \"bc30415\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30415\"\nms.assetid: 8ce97188-ff96-4e8c-917c-efc2f94173a3","nodes":[{"content":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","nodes":[{"content":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[226,284],"content":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","linkify":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","nodes":[{"content":"'ReDim' cannot change the number of dimensions of an array","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"You have attempted to use <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReDim`</ph> to change the rank (number of dimensions) of an array.","pos":[285,373],"source":"You have attempted to use `ReDim` to change the rank (number of dimensions) of an array."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReDim`</ph> statement can be used to change the size of one or more dimensions of an array that has already been formally declared, but it cannot change the rank of an array.","pos":[374,548],"source":" The `ReDim` statement can be used to change the size of one or more dimensions of an array that has already been formally declared, but it cannot change the rank of an array."},{"pos":[555,576],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30415","source":"**Error ID:** BC30415"},{"pos":[585,606],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[616,758],"content":"Make sure that you intend the rank instead of the sizes of the array, and if possible, use <ph id=\"ph1\">`Dim`</ph> to declare a new array with the desired rank.","source":"Make sure that you intend the rank instead of the sizes of the array, and if possible, use `Dim` to declare a new array with the desired rank."},{"pos":[767,775],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[779,865],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ReDim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[ReDim Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)"},{"pos":[868,950],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Dim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Dim Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)"},{"pos":[953,1050],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Arrays in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Arrays in Visual Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)"}]}
