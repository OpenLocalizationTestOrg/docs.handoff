In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], the semantics of SQL are left unchanged. For this reason, `Sum` evaluates to null instead of to zero for an empty sequence or for a sequence that contains only nulls.  \n  \n-   SQL limitations on intermediate results apply to aggregates in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]. Sum of 32-bit integer quantities is not computed by using 64-bit results, and overflow can occur for the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translation of `Sum`. This possibility exists even if the Standard Query Operator implementation does not cause an overflow for the corresponding in-memory sequence.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example finds the total freight of all orders in the `Order` table.  \n  \n If you run this query against the Northwind sample database, the output is: `64942.6900`.  \n  \n

number of units on order for all products.  \n  \n If you run this query against the Northwind sample database, the output is: `780`.  \n  \n Note that you must cast `short` types (for example, `UnitsOnOrder`) because `Sum` has no overload for short types.  \n  \n
