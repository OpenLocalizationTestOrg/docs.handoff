If the `append` parameter is `True`, it will append the data to the file; otherwise data in the file is overwritten.  \n  \n If the specified path excluding the file name is not valid, a <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException> exception will be thrown. If the path is valid but the file does not exist, the file will be created.  \n  \n### To write to a binary file  \n  \n-   Use the `WriteAllBytes` method, supplying the file path and name and the bytes to be written. This example appends the data array `CustomerData` to the file named `CollectedData.dat`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#27](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMyFileSystem/VB/Class1.vb#27)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may create an exception:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string; it contains only white space; or it contains invalid characters.
