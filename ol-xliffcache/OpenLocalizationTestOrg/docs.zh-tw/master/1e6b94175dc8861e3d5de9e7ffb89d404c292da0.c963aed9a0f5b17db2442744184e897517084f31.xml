However, the application cannot ignore a `MustOverride` property or procedure, because it must access that property or procedure to override it.  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40034  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you require CLS compliance and have control over the class source code, mark the member as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`.  \n  \n-   If you require CLS compliance and do not have control over the class source code, or if it does not qualify to be compliant, define this member within a different class.  \n  \n-   If you require that this member remain noncompliant, remove the `MustOverride` keyword from its definition, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from the class definition, or mark the class as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.  \n  \n##
