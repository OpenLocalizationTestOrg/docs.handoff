For strongly named assemblies, equivalency requires the assembly name, version, public key token, and culture to be identical. For simply named assemblies, equivalency requires a match on the assembly name and culture.  \n  \n-   Both assembly identities refer to assemblies that run on the .NET Framework. This condition returns `true` even if the assembly version numbers do not match.  \n  \n-   The two assemblies are not managed assemblies, but `fUnified1` or `fUnified2` was set to `true`.  \n  \n The `fUnified` flag indicates that all version numbers up to the version number of the strongly named assembly are considered equivalent to the strongly named assembly. For example, if the value of `pwzAssemblyIndentity1` is \"MyAssembly, version=3.0.0.0, culture=neutral, publicKeyToken=....\", and the value of `fUnified1` is `true`, this indicates that all versions of MyAssembly from version 0.0.0.0 to 3.0.0.0 should be treated as equivalent. In such a case, if `pwzAssemblyIndentity2` refers to the same assembly as `pwzAssemblyIndentity1`, except that it has a lower version number, `pfEquivalent` is set to `true`. If `pwzAssemblyIdentity2` refers to a higher version number, `pfEquivalent` is set to `true` only if the value of `fUnified2` is `true`.  \n  \n The `pResult` parameter includes specific information about why the two assemblies are considered equivalent or not equivalent.
