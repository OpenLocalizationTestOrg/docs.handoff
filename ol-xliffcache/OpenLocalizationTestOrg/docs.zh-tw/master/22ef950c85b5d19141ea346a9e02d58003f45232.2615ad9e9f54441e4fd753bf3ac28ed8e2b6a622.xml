Using `yield` to define an iterator removes the need for an explicit extra class (the class that holds the state for an enumeration, see <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601> for an example) when you implement the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> and <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> pattern for a custom collection type.  \n  \n The following example shows the two forms of the `yield` statement.  \n  \n```csharp  \nyield return <expression>;  \nyield break;  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n You use a `yield return` statement to return each element one at a time.  \n  \n You consume an iterator method by using a [foreach](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/foreach-in.md) statement or LINQ query. Each iteration of the `foreach` loop calls the iterator method. When a `yield return` statement is reached in the iterator method, `expression` is returned, and the current location in code is retained. Execution is restarted from that location the next time that the iterator function is called.  \n  \n You can use a `yield break` statement to end the iteration.  \n  \n For more information about iterators, see [Iterators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f45331db-d595-46ec-9142-551d3d1eb1a7).  \n  \n## Iterator Methods and get Accessors  \n The declaration of an iterator must meet the following requirements:  \n  \n-   The return type must be <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>, <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>, <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator>, or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601>.  \n  \n-   The declaration can't have any [ref](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/ref.md) or [out](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/out.md) parameters.  \n  \n The `yield` type of an iterator that returns <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator> is `object`.  If the iterator returns <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601>, there must be an implicit conversion from the type of the expression in the `yield return` statement to the generic type parameter .  \n  \n You can't include a `yield return` or `yield break` statement in methods that have the following characteristics:  \n  \n-   Anonymous methods. For more information, see [Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md).  \n  \n-   Methods that contain unsafe blocks. For more information, see [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md).  \n  \n## Exception Handling  \n A `yield return` statement can't be located in a try-catch block. A `yield return` statement can be located in the try block of a try-finally statement.  \n  \n A `yield break` statement can be located in a try block or a catch block but not a finally block.  \n  \n If the `foreach` body (outside of the iterator method) throws an exception, a `finally` block in the iterator method is executed.  \n  \n## Technical Implementation  \n The following code returns an `IEnumerable<string>` from an iterator method and then iterates through its elements.  \n  \n```csharp  \nIEnumerable<string> elements = MyIteratorMethod();  \nforeach (string element in elements)  \n{  \n   ...  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The call to `MyIteratorMethod` doesn't execute the body of the method. Instead the call returns an `IEnumerable<string>` into the `elements` variable.  \n  \n On an iteration of the `foreach` loop, the <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerator.MoveNext%2A> method is called for `elements`. This call executes the body of `MyIteratorMethod` until the next `yield return` statement is reached. The expression returned by the `yield return` statement determines not only the value of the `element` variable for consumption by the loop body but also the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator%601.Current%2A> property of elements, which is an `IEnumerable<string>`.  \n  \n On each subsequent iteration of the `foreach` loop, the execution of the iterator body continues from where it left off, again stopping when it reaches a `yield return` statement. The `foreach` loop completes when the end of the iterator method or a `yield break` statement is reached.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example has a `yield return` statement that's inside a `for` loop. Each iteration of the `foreach` statement body in `Process` creates a call to the `Power` iterator function. Each call to the iterator function proceeds to the next execution of the `yield return` statement, which occurs during the next iteration of the `for` loop.  \n  \n The return type of the iterator method is <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>, which is an iterator interface type. When the iterator method is called, it returns an enumerable object that contains the powers of a number.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsContextual#5](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/yield_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates a `get` accessor that is an iterator. In the example, each `yield return` statement returns an instance of a user-defined class.  \n  \n
