Instead, the sample calls the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A> method. The sample is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) client application that loads XAML workflows using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class and executes them. After they have been loaded using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class, a <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity%601> is returned that can be executed.\n\n#### To use this sample\n\n1.  Using Visual Studio 2010, open the LoadFromXAML.sln solution file.\n\n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.\n\n3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
