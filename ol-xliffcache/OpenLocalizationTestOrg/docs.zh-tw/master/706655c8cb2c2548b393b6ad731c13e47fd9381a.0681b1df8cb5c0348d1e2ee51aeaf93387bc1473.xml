There are three reasons to group controls:  \n  \n-   To create a visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface.  \n  \n-   To create programmatic grouping (of radio buttons, for example).  \n  \n-   For moving the controls as a unit at design time.  \n  \n### To create a group of controls  \n  \n1.  Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control on a form.  \n  \n2.  Add other controls to the group box, drawing each inside the group box.  \n  \n     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, and then paste them into the group box. You can also drag them into the group box.  \n  \n3.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property of the group box to an appropriate caption.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox>\n- [GroupBox Control](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,306],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], grouping\"\n  - \"GroupBox control [Windows Forms], grouping controls\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, grouping\"\nms.assetid: 0bda316d-bd2a-43aa-ac73-342453303169","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[313,375],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","linkify":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to group other controls.","pos":[376,469],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to group other controls."},{"content":"There are three reasons to group controls:","pos":[470,512]},{"content":"To create a visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface.","pos":[522,602]},{"content":"To create programmatic grouping (of radio buttons, for example).","pos":[612,676]},{"content":"For moving the controls as a unit at design time.","pos":[686,735]},{"pos":[745,774],"content":"To create a group of controls","linkify":"To create a group of controls","nodes":[{"content":"To create a group of controls","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[784,846],"content":"Draw a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control on a form.","source":"Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control on a form."},{"content":"Add other controls to the group box, drawing each inside the group box.","pos":[856,927]},{"content":"If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control, and then paste them into the group box.","pos":[938,1165],"source":"If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, and then paste them into the group box."},{"content":"You can also drag them into the group box.","pos":[1166,1208]},{"pos":[1218,1323],"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property of the group box to an appropriate caption.","source":"Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property of the group box to an appropriate caption."},{"pos":[1332,1340],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1383,1436],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[GroupBox Control](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
