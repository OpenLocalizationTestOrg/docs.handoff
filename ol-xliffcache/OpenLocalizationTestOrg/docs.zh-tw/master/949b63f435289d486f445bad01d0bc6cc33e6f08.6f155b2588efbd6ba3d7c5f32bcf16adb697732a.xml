Set the `DataSource` property to a data source object. Possible data sources include a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface. For more information, see [Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms](../data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n2.  If you are binding to a table, set the `DisplayMember` property to the name of a column in the data source.  \n  \n     \\- or -  \n  \n     If you are binding to an <xref:System.Collections.IList>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub BindComboBox()  \n      ComboBox1.DataSource = DataSet1.Tables(\"Suppliers\")  \n      ComboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\"  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void BindComboBox()  \n    {  \n      comboBox1.DataSource = dataSet1.Tables[\"Suppliers\"];  \n      comboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\";  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you are bound to a data source that does not implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList> interface, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, the bound control's data will not be updated when the data source is updated. For example, if you have a combo box bound to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> and data is added to the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, these new items will not appear in the combo box. However, you can force the combo box to be updated by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.SuspendBinding%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.ResumeBinding%2A> methods on the instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingContext> class to which the control is bound.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>\n- [Windows Forms Data Binding](../windows-forms-data-binding.md)\n- [Data Binding and Windows Forms](../data-binding-and-windows-forms.md)\n- [Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,650],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"data [Windows Forms], binding to controls\"\n  - \"list boxes [Windows Forms], data binding\"\n  - \"ComboBox control [Windows Forms], data binding\"\n  - \"data binding [Windows Forms], combo boxes\"\n  - \"ListBox control [Windows Forms], data binding\"\n  - \"combo boxes [Windows Forms], data binding\"\n  - \"bound controls [Windows Forms], combo boxes\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, data binding\"\n  - \"data-bound controls [Windows Forms], Windows Forms\"\nms.assetid: dfd7f081-8bea-4a41-86a3-86a1934828ef","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[657,721],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","linkify":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[722,922],"content":"You can bind the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox&gt;</ph> to data to perform tasks such as browsing data in a database, entering new data, or editing existing data.","source":"You can bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> to data to perform tasks such as browsing data in a database, entering new data, or editing existing data."},{"pos":[932,969],"content":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","linkify":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","nodes":[{"content":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">`DataSource`</ph> property to a data source object.","pos":[979,1033],"source":"Set the `DataSource` property to a data source object."},{"content":"Possible data sources include a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource&gt;</ph> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.IList&gt;</ph> interface.","pos":[1034,1267],"source":" Possible data sources include a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1268,1383],"source":" For more information, see [Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms](../data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1393,1500],"content":"If you are binding to a table, set the <ph id=\"ph1\">`DisplayMember`</ph> property to the name of a column in the data source.","source":"If you are binding to a table, set the `DisplayMember` property to the name of a column in the data source."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\-</ph> or -","pos":[1511,1518],"source":"\\- or -"},{"pos":[1529,1655],"content":"If you are binding to an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.IList&gt;</ph>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list.","source":"If you are binding to an <xref:System.Collections.IList>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list."},{"pos":[2036,2798],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIf you are bound to a data source that does not implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList> interface, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, the bound control's data will not be updated when the data source is updated.
