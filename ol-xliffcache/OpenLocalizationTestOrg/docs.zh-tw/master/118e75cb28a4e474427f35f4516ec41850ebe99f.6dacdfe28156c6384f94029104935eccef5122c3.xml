The <xref:System.AppDomainManager> is loaded into each <xref:System.AppDomain> when that <xref:System.AppDomain> is created. If it chooses, the CLR notifies the host that the application domain has been created by setting the value of the `pUnkAppDomainManager` parameter.  \n  \n In its implementation of the `SetAppDomainManager` method, the host can set the assembly name and type for the application domain manager.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
