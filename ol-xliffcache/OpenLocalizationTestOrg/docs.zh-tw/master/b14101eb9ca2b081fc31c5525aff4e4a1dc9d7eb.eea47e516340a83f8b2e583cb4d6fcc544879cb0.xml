You can use the `DataGridView` control to show read-only views of a small amount of data, or you can scale it to show editable views of very large sets of data.  \n  \n You can extend the `DataGridView` control in a number of ways to build custom behaviors into your applications. For example, you can programmatically specify your own sorting algorithms, and you can create your own types of cells. You can easily customize the appearance of the `DataGridView` control by choosing among several properties. Many types of data stores can be used as a data source, or the `DataGridView` control can operate with no data source bound to it.  \n  \n The topics in this section describe the concepts and techniques that you can use to build `DataGridView` features into your applications.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [DataGridView Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/datagridview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides topics that describe the architecture and core concepts of the Windows Forms `DataGridView` control.  \n  \n [Default Functionality in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/default-functionality-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes the default appearance and behavior of the Windows Forms `DataGridView` control when it is bound to a data source.  \n  \n [Column Types in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/column-types-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes the column types in the Windows Forms `DataGridView` control used to display data and allow users to modify or add data.  \n  \n [Basic Column, Row, and Cell Features in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/basic-column-row-and-cell-features-wf-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe commonly-used cell, row, and column properties.  \n  \n [Basic Formatting and Styling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/basic-formatting-and-styling-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to modify the basic appearance of the control and the display formatting of cell data.  \n  \n [Displaying Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/displaying-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to populate the control with data either manually, or from an external data source.  \n  \n [Resizing Columns and Rows in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/resizing-columns-and-rows-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how the size of rows and columns can be adjusted automatically to fit cell content or to fit the available width of the control.  \n  \n [Sorting Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/sorting-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe the sorting features in the control.  \n  \n [Data Entry in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/data-entry-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to change the way users add and modify data in the control.  \n  \n [Selection and Clipboard Use with the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/selection-and-clipboard-use-with-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe the cell, row, and column selection features in the control.  \n  \n [Programming with Cells, Rows, and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/programming-with-cells-rows-and-columns-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to program with cell, row, and column objects.  \n  \n [Customizing the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/customizing-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe custom painting `DataGridView` cells and rows, and creating derived cell, column, and row types.  \n  \n [Performance Tuning in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/performance-tuning-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Provides topics that describe how to use the control efficiently to avoid performance problems when working with large amounts of data.  \n  \n [Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/default-keyboard-and-mouse-handling-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how users can interact with the `DataGridView` control through a keyboard and a mouse.  \n  \n [Differences Between the Windows Forms DataGridView and DataGrid Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/differences-between-the-windows-forms-datagridview-and-datagrid-controls.md)  \n Describes how the `DataGridView` control improves upon and replaces the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control.  \n  \n Also see [Using the Designer with the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms171593\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component are designed to work closely together.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls to Use on
