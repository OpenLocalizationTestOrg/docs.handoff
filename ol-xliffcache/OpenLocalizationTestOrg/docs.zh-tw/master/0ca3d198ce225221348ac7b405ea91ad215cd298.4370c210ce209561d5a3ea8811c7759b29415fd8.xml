A message could not be forwarded to a specific neighbor because the quota set for that neighbor has been exceeded. This occurs when an unresponsive neighbor fails to clear a backlog of messages pending for that neighbor.  \n  \n## Troubleshooting  \n Reduce the rate at which messages are sent within the mesh.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,151],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: b8371d0a-843e-440b-b86a-6996db131cb0","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","pos":[0,67]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[158,225],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"The inbound receive rate of messages is too high.","pos":[226,275]},{"pos":[284,295],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This trace occurs when attempting to process inbound messages.","pos":[299,361]},{"content":"A message could not be forwarded to a specific neighbor because the quota set for that neighbor has been exceeded.","pos":[362,476]},{"content":"This occurs when an unresponsive neighbor fails to clear a backlog of messages pending for that neighbor.","pos":[477,582]},{"pos":[591,606],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Reduce the rate at which messages are sent within the mesh.","pos":[610,669]},{"pos":[678,686],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[690,763],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[766,919],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[922,1010],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
