Doing so would produce an ambiguity about which version to access.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32072  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the type argument supplied to the generic interface so that there is no conflict.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Remove from the `Implements` statement one of the interfaces resulting in the implementation conflict.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Class Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/class-statement.md)\n- [Interface Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/interface-statement.md)\n- [Implements Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)\n\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,348],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Cannot implement interface '<interfacename1>' because its implementation could conflict with the implementation of another implemented interface '<interfacename2>' for some type arguments\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
