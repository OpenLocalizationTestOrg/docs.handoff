Alternatively, you can use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> for drawing text on a form. For more information, see [How to: Draw Text with GDI](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#7)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#7)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n You cannot call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler. The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form. To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The Arial font is not installed.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat.FormatFlags%2A>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormatFlags>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextFormatFlags>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>\n- [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)\n- [How to: Draw Text with GDI](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,263],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"forms [Windows Forms], drawing text\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], drawing\"\nms.assetid: 5d2447a9-21a1-4adc-b954-5516f2bb9b2c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","pos":[0,35]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[270,305],"content":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","linkify":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"The following code example shows how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> to draw text on a form.","pos":[306,467],"source":"The following code example shows how to use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> to draw text on a form."},{"content":"Alternatively, you can use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer&gt;</ph> for drawing text on a form.","pos":[468,563],"source":" Alternatively, you can use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> for drawing text on a form."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Draw Text with GDI<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)</ept>.","pos":[564,649],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Draw Text with GDI](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)."},{"pos":[658,665],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1108,1126],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"You cannot call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A&gt;</ph> method in the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load&gt;</ph> event handler.","pos":[1130,1261],"source":"You cannot call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler."},{"content":"The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form.","pos":[1262,1351]},{"content":"To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1352,1474],"source":" To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method."},{"pos":[1483,1501],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1505,1553]},{"content":"The Arial font is not installed.","pos":[1563,1595]},{"pos":[1604,1612],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1907,1996],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started with Graphics Programming<ept id=\"p1\">](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)</ept>","source":"[Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)"},{"pos":[1999,2057],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Draw Text with GDI<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Draw Text with GDI](how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)"}]}
