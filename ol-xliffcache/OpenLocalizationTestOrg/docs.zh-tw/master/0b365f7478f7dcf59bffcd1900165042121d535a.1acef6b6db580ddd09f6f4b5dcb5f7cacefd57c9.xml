The **XmlEntityReference** contains child nodes copied from the content in the entity declaration. The preceding code example contains text in the entity declaration, so an **XmlText** node is created as the child node of the entity reference node.  \n  \n ![Tree structure for preserved entity references](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/media/xmlentityref-notexpanded-nodes.gif \"xmlentityref_notexpanded_nodes\")  \nTree structure for entity references that are preserved  \n  \n The child nodes of the **XmlEntityReference** are copies of all the child nodes created from the **XmlEntity** node when the entity declaration was encountered.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The nodes copied from the **XmlEntity** are not always exact copies once placed under the entity reference node.
