After the transport format is determined, you can call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A> or <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> methods, as required.  \n  \n### To deserialize an object  \n  \n1.  Construct a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> using the type of the object to deserialize.  \n  \n2.  Call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> method to produce a replica of the object. When deserializing, you must cast the returned object to the type of the original, as shown in the following example, which deserializes the object into a file (although it could also be deserialized into a stream).  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myObject As MySerializableClass  \n    ' Construct an instance of the XmlSerializer with the type  \n    ' of object that is being deserialized.  \n    Dim mySerializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(GetType(MySerializableClass))  \n    ' To read the file, create a FileStream.  \n    Dim myFileStream As FileStream = _  \n    New FileStream(\"myFileName.xml\", FileMode.Open)  \n    ' Call the Deserialize method and cast to the object type.  \n    myObject = CType( _  \n    mySerializer.Deserialize(myFileStream), MySerializableClass)  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    MySerializableClass myObject;  \n    // Construct an instance of the XmlSerializer with the type  \n    // of object that is being deserialized.  \n    XmlSerializer mySerializer =   \n    new XmlSerializer(typeof(MySerializableClass));  \n    // To read the file, create a FileStream.  \n    FileStream myFileStream =   \n    new FileStream(\"myFileName.xml\", FileMode.Open);  \n    // Call the Deserialize method and cast to the object type.  \n    myObject = (MySerializableClass)   \n    mySerializer.Deserialize(myFileStream)  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introducing XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md)   \n [How to: Serialize an Object](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"How to: Deserialize an Object | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Deserialize an Object | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[465,494],"content":"How to: Deserialize an Object","linkify":"How to: Deserialize an Object","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Deserialize an Object","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"When you deserialize an object, the transport format determines whether you will create a stream or file object.","pos":[495,607]},{"content":"After the transport format is determined, you can call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A&gt;</ph> methods, as required.","pos":[608,811],"source":" After the transport format is determined, you can call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A> or <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> methods, as required."},{"pos":[821,845],"content":"To deserialize an object","linkify":"To deserialize an object","nodes":[{"content":"To deserialize an object","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Construct a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt;</ph> using the type of the object to deserialize.","pos":[855,957],"source":"Construct a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> using the type of the object to deserialize."},{"content":"Call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A&gt;</ph> method to produce a replica of the object.","pos":[967,1079],"source":"Call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Deserialize%2A> method to produce a replica of the object."},{"content":"When deserializing, you must cast the returned object to the type of the original, as shown in the following example, which deserializes the object into a file (although it could also be deserialized into a stream).","pos":[1080,1295]},{"pos":[2430,2438],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introducing XML Serialization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2442,2546],"source":"[Introducing XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Serialize an Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object.md)</ept>","pos":[2549,2648],"source":" [How to: Serialize an Object](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object.md)"}]}
