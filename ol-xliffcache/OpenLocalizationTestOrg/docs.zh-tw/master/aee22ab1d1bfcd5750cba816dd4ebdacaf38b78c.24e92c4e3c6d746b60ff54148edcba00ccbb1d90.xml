If there is no accessible constructor in the base class that can be called without arguments, or if there is more than one, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot generate an implicit constructor.  \n  \n This situation can arise, for example, if one base class constructor has a single `Optional` argument and another has a single `ParamArray` argument. Each of these can be called with no arguments.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32036  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Declare and implement at least one `Sub New` constructor somewhere in the derived class.  \n  \n2.
