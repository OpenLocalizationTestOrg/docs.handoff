The `ContentProperty` attribute declares that the `\"Body\"` property can be skipped in the XAML representation of an instance of this activity.  \n  \n```  \n<Border x:Uid=\"Border_1\" BorderThickness =\"1\">  \n    <sad:WorkflowItemPresenter   \n    x:Uid=\"sad:WorkflowItemPresenter_1\" AutomationProperties.AutomationId=\"Body\" Item=\"{Binding Path=ModelItem.Body, Mode=TwoWay}\"  \n    AllowedItemType=\"{x:Type sa:Activity}\"  \n    HintText=\"Drop activity here\"   \n    Margin=\"5,5,5,5\" />  \n</Border>  \n```  \n  \n In the designer class, XAML is used to create a custom visual representation of the activity. <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowItemPresenter> is a class that provides the visual editor.  \n  \n A single activity can be dropped onto the `CommentOut` activity surface. If you want to add multiple activities to this surface, drag a sequence activity here first.  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Open CommentOut.sln in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Compile the solution by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  Start the sample without debugging by pressing CTRL+F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
