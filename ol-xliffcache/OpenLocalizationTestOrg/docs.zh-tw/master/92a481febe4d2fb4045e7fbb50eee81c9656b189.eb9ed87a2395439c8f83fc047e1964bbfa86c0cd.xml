Check that the intended `#If` is not separated from the clause in question by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Only one `#Else` is permitted in each `#If` block, so two successive `#Else` directives cause this error.  \n  \n2.
