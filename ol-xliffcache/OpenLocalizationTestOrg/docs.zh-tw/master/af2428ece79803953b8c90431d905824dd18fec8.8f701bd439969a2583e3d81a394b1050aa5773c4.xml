This topic provides a script written in HTML/JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is present on a system.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more detailed information on installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../install/guide-for-developers.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n When the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the MSI adds \".NET CLR\" and the version number to the UserAgent string. The following example shows a script embedded in a simple HTML page. The script searches the UserAgent string to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, and displays a status message on the results of the search.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This script is designed for Internet Explorer.
