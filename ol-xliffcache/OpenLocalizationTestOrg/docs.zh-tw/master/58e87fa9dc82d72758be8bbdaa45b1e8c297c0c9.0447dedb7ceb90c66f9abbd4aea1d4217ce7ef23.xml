A method with an optional parameter is equivalent to two overloaded methods, one with the optional parameter, and the other without it. Therefore, you cannot overload a method with an argument list corresponding to either of these.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30300  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than optional parameters.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Procedure Overloading](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)\n- [Considerations in Overloading Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,263],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30300\"\n  - \"bc30300\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30300\"\nms.assetid: adb44ceb-57a0-4123-8fd8-7eb83c3f601f","nodes":[{"content":"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters","nodes":[{"pos":[0,102],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;method1&gt;</ph>' and '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;method2&gt;</ph>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters","source":"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[270,374],"content":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters","linkify":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>method1&gt;' and '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>method2&gt;' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters","pos":[0,104],"source":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by optional parameters"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only in its optional parameters.","pos":[375,495]},{"content":"A method with an optional parameter is equivalent to two overloaded methods, one with the optional parameter, and the other without it.","pos":[496,631]},{"content":"Therefore, you cannot overload a method with an argument list corresponding to either of these.","pos":[632,727]},{"pos":[734,755],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30300","source":"**Error ID:** BC30300"},{"pos":[764,785],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than optional parameters.","pos":[795,871]},{"pos":[880,888],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[892,1007],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Procedure Overloading<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)</ept>","source":"[Procedure Overloading](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)"},{"pos":[1010,1163],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Considerations in Overloading Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Considerations in Overloading Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)"}]}
