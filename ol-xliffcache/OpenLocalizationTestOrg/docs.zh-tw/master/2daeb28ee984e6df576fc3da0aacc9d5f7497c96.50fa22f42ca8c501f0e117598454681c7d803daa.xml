Converting a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] application to use peer-to-peer connections requires a binding that supports this technology when making client connections. Peer Channel provides a binding called <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetPeerTcpBinding>, which you can use in a similar way to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding>. Key differences include specifying a resolver service and defining security settings.  \n  \n If an application is using the default resolver and security settings, converting a normal client/server-based application to use Peer Channel entails changing the name of the binding from \"NetTcpBinding\" to \"NetPeerTcpBinding\" in the application’s configuration file—you do not have to change the application code base.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Building a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)\n- [System-Provided Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,152],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: d4137292-a923-4b8f-8594-42276f2d3ce2","nodes":[{"content":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","nodes":[{"content":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","pos":[0,68]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[159,227],"content":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","linkify":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","nodes":[{"content":"Converting a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application","pos":[0,68]}]},{"content":"You can create connections between clients using the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)]</ph> by using bindings that describe the parameters of the connection.","pos":[228,408],"source":"You can create connections between clients using the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] by using bindings that describe the parameters of the connection."},{"content":"Converting a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> application to use peer-to-peer connections requires a binding that supports this technology when making client connections.","pos":[409,610],"source":" Converting a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] application to use peer-to-peer connections requires a binding that supports this technology when making client connections."},{"content":"Peer Channel provides a binding called <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.NetPeerTcpBinding&gt;</ph>, which you can use in a similar way to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding&gt;</ph>.","pos":[611,779],"source":" Peer Channel provides a binding called <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetPeerTcpBinding>, which you can use in a similar way to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding>."},{"content":"Key differences include specifying a resolver service and defining security settings.","pos":[780,865]},{"content":"If an application is using the default resolver and security settings, converting a normal client/server-based application to use Peer Channel entails changing the name of the binding from \"NetTcpBinding\" to \"NetPeerTcpBinding\" in the application’s configuration file—you do not have to change the application code base.","pos":[872,1192]},{"pos":[1201,1209],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1213,1337],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building a Peer Channel Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Building a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)"},{"pos":[1340,1426],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>System-Provided Bindings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md)</ept>","source":"[System-Provided Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md)"}]}
