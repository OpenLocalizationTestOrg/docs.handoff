However, it indicates that the chosen poison message disposition failed for a message. See [Poison-Message Handling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,87],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,75]}]},{"pos":[385,443],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"Cannot move or delete message.","pos":[444,474]},{"pos":[483,494],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"The trace indicates that a failure occurred when attempting to move, delete, or reject an MSMQ message.","pos":[498,601]},{"pos":[608,899],"content":"MSMQ messages are employed by <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> (when used with either the NetMsmqBinding or the MsmqIntegrationBinding).This trace is related to the chosen value of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`ReceiveErrorHandling`</ph> property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding.","source":"MSMQ messages are employed by [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] (when used with either the NetMsmqBinding or the MsmqIntegrationBinding).This trace is related to the chosen value of the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding."},{"content":"This trace is not indicative of an overall system failure.","pos":[906,964]},{"content":"However, it indicates that the chosen poison message disposition failed for a message.","pos":[965,1051]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Poison-Message Handling<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546)</ept> for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.","pos":[1052,1239],"source":" See [Poison-Message Handling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately."},{"pos":[1248,1256],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1260,1334],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1337,1492],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1495,1584],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
