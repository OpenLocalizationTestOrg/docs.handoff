Some examples of recoloring are changing one color to another, adjusting a color's intensity relative to another color, adjusting the brightness or contrast of all colors, and converting colors to shades of gray.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Use a Color Matrix to Transform a Single Color](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-a-color-matrix-to-transform-a-single-color.md)  \n Discusses using a color matrix to transform a color.  \n  \n [How to: Translate Image Colors](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-translate-image-colors.md)  \n Shows how to translate colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [Using Transformations to Scale Colors](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-transformations-to-scale-colors.md)  \n Explains how to scale colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Rotate Colors](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-rotate-colors.md)  \n Describes how to rotate a color using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Shear Colors](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-shear-colors.md)  \n Defines shearing and explains how to shear colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Color Remap Table](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-a-color-remap-table.md)  \n Defines remapping and shows how to use a color remap table.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
