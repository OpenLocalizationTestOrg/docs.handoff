Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property. You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code.  \n  \n### To disable a menu item programmatically  \n  \n-   Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MenuItem1.Enabled = False  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    menuItem1.Enabled = false;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    menuItem1->Enabled = false;  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  Disabling the first or top-level menu item in a menu hides all the menu items contained within the menu, but does not disable them. Likewise, disabling a menu item that has submenu items hides the submenu items, but does not disable them. If all the commands on a given menu are unavailable to the user, it is considered good programming practice to both hide and disable the entire menu, as this presents a clean user interface. You should hide and disable the menu, and disable every item and submenu item in the menu, because hiding alone does not prevent access to a menu command via a shortcut key. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.Visible%2A> property of a top-level menu item to `false` to hide the entire menu.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem>\n- [How to: Hide ToolStripMenuItems](how-to-hide-toolstripmenuitems.md)\n- [MenuStrip Control Overview](menustrip-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,451],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ToolStripMenuItems [Windows Forms], enabling\"\n  - \"ToolStripMenuItems [Windows Forms], disabling\"\n  - \"menu items [Windows Forms], disabling\"\n  - \"disabling menu items\"\n  - \"menu items [Windows Forms], enabling\"\n  - \"menus [Windows Forms], disabling menu items\"\nms.assetid: bcc1da84-50fd-41d2-8475-103b581d5654","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","pos":[0,34]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[458,492],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","linkify":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"You can limit or broaden the commands a user may make by enabling and disabling menu items in response to user activities.","pos":[493,615]},{"content":"Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[616,776],"source":" Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property."},{"content":"You can manipulate this property at design time in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window or programmatically by setting it in code.","pos":[777,896],"source":" You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code."},{"pos":[906,945],"content":"To disable a menu item programmatically","linkify":"To disable a menu item programmatically","nodes":[{"content":"To disable a menu item programmatically","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[955,1117],"content":"Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","source":"Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property to `false`."},{"pos":[1308,2056],"content":"[!TIP]\nDisabling the first or top-level menu item in a menu hides all the menu items contained within the menu, but does not disable them.
