You can use these methods to resize <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> elements at times of your choosing. Alternately, you can configure the control to resize these elements automatically whenever content changes. This can be inefficient, however, when you are working with large data sets or when your data changes frequently. For more information, see [Sizing Options in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/sizing-options-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n Typically, you will programmatically adjust <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> elements to fit their content only when you load new data from a data source or when the user has edited a value. This is useful to optimize performance, but it is also useful when you want to enable your users to manually resize rows and columns with the mouse.  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the options available to you for programmatic resizing.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing#0](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing/CPP/programmaticsizing.cpp#0)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing/CS/programmaticsizing.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ProgrammaticResizing/VB/programmaticsizing.vb#0)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
