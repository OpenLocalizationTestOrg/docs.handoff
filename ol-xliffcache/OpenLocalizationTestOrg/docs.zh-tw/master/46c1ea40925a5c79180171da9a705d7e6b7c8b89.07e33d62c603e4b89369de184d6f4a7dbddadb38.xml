The act of promoting a property causes the value to be available within a special view in the database. These promoted properties (properties that can be used in user queries) can be of simple types such as Int64, Guid, String, and DateTime or of a serialized binary type (byte[]).\n\nThe <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SqlWorkflowInstanceStore> class has the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SqlWorkflowInstanceStore.Promote%2A> method that you can use to promote a property as a property that can be used in queries. The following example is an end-to-end example of store extensibility.\n\n1. In this example scenario, a document processing (DP) application has workflows, each of which uses custom activities for document processing. These workflows have a set of state variables that need to be made visible to the end user. To achieve this, the DP application provides an instance extension of type <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant>, which is used by activities to supply the state variables.\n\n    ```csharp\n    class DocumentStatusExtension : PersistenceParticipant\n    {\n        public string DocumentId;\n        public string ApprovalStatus;\n        public string UserName;\n        public DateTime LastUpdateTime;\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. The new extension is then added to the host.\n\n    ```csharp\n    static Activity workflow = CreateWorkflow();\n    WorkflowApplication application = new WorkflowApplication(workflow);\n    DocumentStatusExtension documentStatusExtension = new DocumentStatusExtension ();\n    application.Extensions.Add(documentStatusExtension);\n    ```\n\n     For more details about adding a custom persistence participant, see the [Persistence Participants](persistence-participants.md) sample.\n\n3. The custom activities in the DP application populate various status fields in the **Execute** method.\n\n    ```csharp\n    public override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)\n    {\n        // ...\n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().DocumentId = Guid.NewGuid();\n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().UserName = \"John Smith\";\n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().ApprovalStatus = \"Approved\";\n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().LastUpdateTime = DateTime.Now();\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. When a workflow instance reaches a persistence point, the **CollectValues** method of the **DocumentStatusExtension** persistence participant saves these properties into the persistence data collection.\n\n    ```csharp\n    class DocumentStatusExtension : PersistenceParticipant\n    {\n        const XNamespace xNS = XNamespace.Get(\"http://contoso.com/DocumentStatus\");\n\n        protected override void CollectValues(out IDictionary<XName, object> readWriteValues, out IDictionary<XName, object> writeOnlyValues)\n        {\n            readWriteValues = new Dictionary<XName, object>();\n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"UserName\"), this.UserName);\n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"ApprovalStatus\"), this.ApprovalStatus);\n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"DocumentId\"), this.DocumentId);\n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"LastModifiedTime\"), this.LastUpdateTime);\n\n            writeOnlyValues = null;\n        }\n        // ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > All these properties are passed to **SqlWorkflowInstanceStore** by the persistence framework through the **SaveWorkflowCommand.InstanceData** collection.\n\n5. The DP application initializes the SQL Workflow Instance Store and invokes the **Promote** method to promote this data.\n\n    ```csharp\n    SqlWorkflowInstanceStore store = new SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(connectionString);\n\n    List<XName> variantProperties = new List<XName>()\n    {\n        xNS.GetName(\"UserName\"),\n        xNS.GetName(\"ApprovalStatus\"),\n        xNS.GetName(\"DocumentId\"),\n        xNS.GetName(\"LastModifiedTime\")\n    };\n\n    store.Promote(\"DocumentStatus\", variantProperties, null);\n    ```\n\n    Based on this promotion information, **SqlWorkflowInstanceStore** places the data properties in the columns of the [InstancePromotedProperties](#InstancePromotedProperties) view.\n\n6. To query a subset of the data from the promotion table, the DP application adds a customized view on top of the promotion view.\n\n    ```sql\n    create view [dbo].[DocumentStatus] with schemabinding\n    as\n        select  P.[InstanceId] as [InstanceId],\n            P.Value1 as [UserName],\n            P.Value2 as [ApprovalStatus],\n            P.Value3 as [DocumentId],\n            P.Value4 as [LastUpdatedTime]\n    from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[InstancePromotedProperties] as P\n    where P.PromotionName = N'DocumentStatus'\n    go\n    ```\n\n## <a name=\"InstancePromotedProperties\"></a> [System.Activities.DurableInstancing.InstancePromotedProperties] view\n\n|Column Name|Column Type|Description|\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|InstanceId|GUID|The workflow instance that this promotion belongs to.|\n|PromotionName|nvarchar(400)|The name of the promotion itself.|\n|Value1, Value2, Value3,..,Value32|sql_variant|The value of the promoted property itself. Most SQL primitive data types except binary blobs and strings over 8000 bytes in length can fit in sql_variant.|\n|Value33, Value34, Value35, …, Value64|varbinary(max)|The value of promoted properties that are explicitly declared as varbinary(max).|\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,103],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Store Extensibility\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
