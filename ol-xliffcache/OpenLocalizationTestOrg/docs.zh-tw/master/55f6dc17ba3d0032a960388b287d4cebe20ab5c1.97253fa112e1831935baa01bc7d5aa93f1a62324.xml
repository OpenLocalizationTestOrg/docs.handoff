One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim first? As Integer  \nDim second As String = \"First is Nothing\"  \n'' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(first, second))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33110  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Console.WriteLine(If(first, CInt(second)))   \n    ```  \n  \n-   Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.  \n  \n    ```  \n    If first IsNot Nothing Then  \n        Console.WriteLine(first)  \n    Else  \n        Console.WriteLine(second)  \n    End If  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)   \n [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)   \n [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,634],"nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39;
