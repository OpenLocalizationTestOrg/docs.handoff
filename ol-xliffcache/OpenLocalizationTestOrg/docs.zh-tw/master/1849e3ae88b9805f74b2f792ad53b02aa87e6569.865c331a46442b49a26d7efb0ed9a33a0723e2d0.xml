Each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> also has its own <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Nodes%2A> collection to store its child nodes. Both collection properties are of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection>, which provides standard collection members that enable you to add, remove, and rearrange the nodes at a single level of the node hierarchy.  \n  \n### To add nodes programmatically  \n  \n1.  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection.Add%2A> method of the tree view's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' Adds new node as a child node of the currently selected node.  \n    Dim newNode As TreeNode = New TreeNode(\"Text for new node\")  \n    TreeView1.SelectedNode.Nodes.Add(newNode)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Adds new node as a child node of the currently selected node.  \n    TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(\"Text for new node\");  \n    treeView1.SelectedNode.Nodes.Add(newNode);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    // Adds new node as a child node of the currently selected node.  \n    TreeNode ^ newNode = new TreeNode(\"Text for new node\");  \n    treeView1->SelectedNode->Nodes->Add(newNode);  \n    ```  \n  \n### To remove nodes programmatically  \n  \n1.  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection.Remove%2A> method of the tree view's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property to remove a single node, or the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNodeCollection.Clear%2A> method to clear all nodes.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' Removes currently selected node, or root if nothing is selected.  \n    TreeView1.Nodes.Remove(TreeView1.SelectedNode)  \n    ' Clears all nodes.  \n    TreeView1.Nodes.Clear()  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Removes currently selected node, or root if nothing   \n    // is selected.  \n    treeView1.Nodes.Remove(treeView1.SelectedNode);  \n    // Clears all nodes.  \n    TreeView1.Nodes.Clear();  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    // Removes currently selected node, or root if nothing  \n    // is selected.  \n    treeView1->Nodes->Remove(treeView1->SelectedNode);  \n    // Clears all nodes.  \n    treeView1->Nodes->Clear();  \n    ```  \n  \n##
