Ink has evolved from being a corollary to the COM and Windows Forms method of programming to achieving full integration into the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. You do not need to install separate SDKs or runtime libraries.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n To use the following examples, you must first install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. You should also understand how to write applications for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For more information about getting started with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], see [Walkthrough: My First WPF Desktop Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application.md).  \n  \n## Quick Start  \n This section helps you write a simple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application that collects ink.  \n  \n If you haven't already done so, install Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications usually must be compiled before you can view them, even if they consist entirely of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]. However, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)] includes an application, XamlPad, designed to speed up the process of implementing a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]-based UI. You can use that application to view and tinker with the first few samples in this document. The process of creating compiled applications from [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] is covered later in this document.  \n  \n To launch XAMLPad, click the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Winndows SDK**, point to **Tools**, and click **XAMLPad**. In the rendering pane, XAMLPad renders the XAML code written in the code pane. You can edit the XAML code, and the changes immediately appear in the rendering pane.  \n  \n#### Got Ink?  \n To start your first [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application that supports ink:  \n  \n1.  Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2005  \n  \n2.  Create a new **Windows Application (WPF)**  \n  \n3.  Type `<InkCanvas/>` between the `<Grid>` tags  \n  \n4.  Press **F5** to launch your application in the debugger  \n  \n5.  Using a stylus or mouse, write **hello world** in the window  \n  \n You've written the ink equivalent of a \"hello world\" application with only 12 keystrokes!  \n  \n#### Spice Up Your Application  \n Let’s take advantage of some features of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].  Replace everything between the opening \\<Window> and closing \\</Window> tags with the following markup to get a gradient brush background on your inking surface.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n[!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#1a](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1a)]  \n  \n#### Using Animation  \n For fun, let's animate the colors of the gradient brush. Add the following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] after the closing `</InkCanvas>` tag but before the closing `</Page>` tag.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  \n  \n#### Adding Some Code Behind the XAML  \n While XAML makes it very easy to design the user interface, any real-world application needs to add code to handle events. Here is a simple example that zooms in on the ink in response to a right-click from a mouse:  \n  \n Set the `MouseRightButtonUp` handler in your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]:  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#3)]  \n  \n In Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer, expand Windows1.xaml and open the code-behind file, Window1.xaml.cs or Window1.xaml.vb if you are using Visual Basic. Add the following event handler code:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window2.xaml.vb#4)]  \n  \n Now, run your application. Add some ink and then right-click with the mouse or perform a press-and-hold equivalent with a stylus.  \n  \n#### Using Procedural Code Instead of XAML  \n You can access all [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] features from procedural code. Here is a \"Hello Ink World\" application for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] that doesn’t use any [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] at all. Paste the code below into an empty Console Application in Visual Studio. Add references to the PresentationCore, PresentationFramework, and WindowsBase assemblies, and build the application by pressing **F5**:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[InkCanvasConsoleApp#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasConsoleApp/CSharp/Program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[InkCanvasConsoleApp#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InkCanvasConsoleApp/VisualBasic/Module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Digital
