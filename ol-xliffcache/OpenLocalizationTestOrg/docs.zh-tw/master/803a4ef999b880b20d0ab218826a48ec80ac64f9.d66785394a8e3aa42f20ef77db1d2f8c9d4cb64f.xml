The following example demonstrates how to write data to, and read data from, a new, empty file stream called `Test.data`. After creating the data file in the current directory, the associated <xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter> and <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader> objects are created, and the <xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter> object is used to write the integers 0 through 10 to `Test.data`, which leaves the file pointer at the end of the file. After setting the file pointer back to the origin, the <xref:System.IO.BinaryReader> object reads out the specified content.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.IO.BinaryReaderWriter#7](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.IO.BinaryReaderWriter/CPP/source6.cpp#7)]\n [!code-csharp[System.IO.BinaryReaderWriter#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.IO.BinaryReaderWriter/CS/source6.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.IO.BinaryReaderWriter#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.IO.BinaryReaderWriter/VB/source6.vb#7)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n If `Test.data` already exists in the current directory, an <xref:System.IO.IOException> exception is thrown. Use the file mode option <xref:System.IO.FileMode?displayProperty=fullName> when you initialize the file stream to always create a new file without throwing an  exception.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
