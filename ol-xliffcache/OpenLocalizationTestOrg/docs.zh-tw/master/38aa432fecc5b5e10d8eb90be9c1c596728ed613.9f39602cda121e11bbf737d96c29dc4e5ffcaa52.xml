The following examples use different types of animations to affect the display of text in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the width of the text block. The width value changes from the width of the text block to 0 over a duration of 10 seconds, and then reverses the width values and continues. This type of animation creates a wipe effect.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample1)]  \n  \n The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the opacity of the text block. The opacity value changes from 1.0 to 0 over a duration of 5 seconds, and then reverses the opacity values and continues.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample2)]  \n  \n The following diagram shows the effect of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control changing its opacity from `1.00` to `0.00` during the 5-second interval defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.Duration%2A>.  \n  \n ![Text changing opacity from 1.00 to 0.00.](./media/how-to-apply-animations-to-text/faded-text-opacity-change.png)  \n   \n The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> to animate the foreground color of the text block. The foreground color value changes from one color to a second color over a duration of 5 seconds, and then reverses the color values and continues.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample3)]  \n  \n The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to rotate the text block. The text block performs a full rotation over a duration of 20 seconds, and then continues to repeat the rotation.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample4)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Animation Overview](../graphics-multimedia/animation-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,201],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Apply Animations to Text\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"typography [WPF], animations\"\n  - \"animation [WPF], text\"\nms.assetid: eec3d26c-0a21-420f-8012-671621c47089","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[208,240],"content":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","linkify":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Animations to Text","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"Animations can alter the display and appearance of text in your application.","pos":[241,317]},{"content":"The following examples use different types of animations to affect the display of text in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[318,459],"source":" The following examples use different types of animations to affect the display of text in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control."},{"pos":[468,475],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation&gt;</ph> to animate the width of the text block.","pos":[479,601],"source":"The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the width of the text block."},{"content":"The width value changes from the width of the text block to 0 over a duration of 10 seconds, and then reverses the width values and continues.","pos":[602,744]},{"content":"This type of animation creates a wipe effect.","pos":[745,790]},{"content":"The following example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation&gt;</ph> to animate the opacity of the text block.","pos":[958,1082],"source":"The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the opacity of the text block."},{"content":"The opacity value changes from 1.0 to 0 over a duration of 5 seconds, and then reverses the opacity values and continues.","pos":[1083,1204]},{"pos":[1372,1613],"content":"The following diagram shows the effect of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> control changing its opacity from <ph id=\"ph2\">`1.00`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph3\">`0.00`</ph> during the 5-second interval defined by the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.Duration%2A&gt;</ph>.","source":"The following diagram shows the effect of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control changing its opacity from `1.00` to `0.00` during the 5-second interval defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.Duration%2A>."},{"content":"Text changing opacity from 1.00 to 0.00.","pos":[1622,1662]},{"content":"The following example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation&gt;</ph> to animate the foreground color of the text block.","pos":[1742,1874],"source":"The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> to animate the foreground color of the text block."},{"content":"The foreground color value changes from one color to a second color over a duration of 5 seconds, and then reverses the color values and continues.","pos":[1875,2022]},{"content":"The following example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation&gt;</ph> to rotate the text block.","pos":[2190,2298],"source":"The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to rotate the text block."},{"content":"The text block performs a full rotation over a duration of 20 seconds, and then continues to repeat the rotation.","pos":[2299,2412]},{"pos":[2582,2590],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2594,2660],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animation Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../graphics-multimedia/animation-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Animation Overview](../graphics-multimedia/animation-overview.md)"}]}
