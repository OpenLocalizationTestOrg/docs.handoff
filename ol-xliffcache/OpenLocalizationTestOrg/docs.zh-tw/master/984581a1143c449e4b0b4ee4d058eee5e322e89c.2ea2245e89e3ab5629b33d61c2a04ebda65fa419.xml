The sample fonts support extended [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] features that can be used by [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"overview\"></a>   \n## Fonts in the OpenType Font Pack  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wcsdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wcsdk-md.md)] provides a set of sample [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] fonts that you can use in creating [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications. The sample fonts are supplied under license from Ascender Corporation. These fonts implement only a subset of the total features defined by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] format. The following table lists the names of the sample [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] fonts.  \n  \n|**Name**|**File**|  \n|--------------|--------------|  \n|Kootenay|Kooten.ttf|  \n|Lindsey|Linds.ttf|  \n|Miramonte|Miramo.ttf|  \n|Miramonte Bold|Miramob.ttf|  \n|Pericles|Peric.ttf|  \n|Pericles Light|Pericl.ttf|  \n|Pescadero|Pesca.ttf|  \n|Pescadero Bold|Pescab.ttf|  \n  \n The following illustration shows what the sample [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_opentype](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-opentype-md.md)] fonts look like.  \n  \n ![List of font names in sample font pack](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/samplefontpack01.gif \"samplefontpack01\")  \nFonts in the OpenType Font Pack  \n  \n The sample fonts are supplied under license from Ascender Corporation. Ascender is a provider of advanced font products.

Use the Fonts control panel to install the fonts. Once these fonts are on your computer, they are accessible to all applications that reference default [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] fonts. You can display a representative set of characters in several font sizes by doubling-clicking the font file. The following screenshot shows the Lindsey font file, Linds.ttf.  \n  \n ![Lindsey font &#40;OpenType&#41;](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/typographyinwpf-04.png \"TypographyInWPF_04\")  \nDisplaying the Lindsey font  \n  \n<a name=\"using_the_fonts\"></a>   \n## Using the Fonts  \n There are two ways that you can use fonts in your application. You can add fonts to your application as project content items that are not embedded as resources within an assembly. Alternatively, you can add fonts to your application as project resource items that are embedded within the application's assembly files.
