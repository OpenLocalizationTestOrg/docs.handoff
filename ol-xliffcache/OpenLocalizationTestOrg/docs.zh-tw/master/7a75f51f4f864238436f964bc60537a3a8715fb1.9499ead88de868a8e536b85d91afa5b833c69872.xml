This procedure is similar to binding a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to a type. You must create a client-side proxy that contains the methods and types exposed by the Web service. You generate a client-side proxy from the Web service (.asmx) itself, or its Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file. Additionally, your client-side proxy must expose the fields of complex types used by the Web service as public properties. You then bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> to one of the types exposed in the Web service proxy.  \n  \n### To create and bind to a client-side proxy  \n  \n1.  Create a Windows Form in the directory of your choice, with an appropriate namespace.  \n  \n2.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to the form.  \n  \n3.  Open the [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../../../../includes/winsdklong-md.md)] command prompt, and navigate to the same directory that your form is located in.  \n  \n4.  Using the WSDL tool, enter `wsdl` and the URL for the .asmx or WSDL file for the Web service, followed by the namespace of your application, and optionally the language you are working in.  \n  \n     The following code example uses the Web service located at http://webservices.eraserver.net/zipcoderesolver/zipcoderesolver.asmx. For example, for C# type `wsdl http://webservices.eraserver.net.zipcoderesolver/zipcoderesolver.asmx /n:BindToWebService`, or for Visual Basic type `wsdl http://webservices.eraserver.net.zipcoderesolver/zipcoderesolver.asmx /n:BindToWebService /language:VB`. Passing the path as an argument to the WSDL tool will generate a client-side proxy in the same directory and namespace as your application, in the specified language. If you are using [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], add the file to your project.  \n  \n5.  Select a type in the client-side proxy to bind to.  \n  \n     This is typically a type returned by a method offered by the Web service. The fields of the chosen type must be exposed as public properties for binding purposes.  \n  \n     [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService/CPP/form1.cpp#4)]\n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService/CS/form1.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorWebService/VB/form1.vb#4)]  \n  \n6.
