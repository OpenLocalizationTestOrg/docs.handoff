Its contents can be wrapped from one row to the next, or from one column to the next. Alternately, its contents can be clipped instead of wrapped.  \n  \n The topics in this section describe the concepts and techniques that allow you to build `FlowLayoutPanel` features into your applications.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [FlowLayoutPanel Control Overview](flowlayoutpanel-control-overview.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `FlowLayoutPanel` control, which allows you to create a layout which flows horizontally or vertically.  \n  \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a FlowLayoutPanel Control](how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-flowlayoutpanel-control.md)  \n Explains how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> properties to anchor and dock child controls in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a FlowLayoutPanel](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-flowlayoutpanel.md).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,260],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"FlowLayoutPanel Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
