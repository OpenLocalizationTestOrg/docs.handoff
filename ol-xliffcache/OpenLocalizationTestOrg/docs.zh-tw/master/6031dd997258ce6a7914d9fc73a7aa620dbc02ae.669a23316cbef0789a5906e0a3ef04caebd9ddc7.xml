In imperative code, these arguments are created using CLR properties on a new type. In XAML, they are declared using `x:Class` and `x:Member` tags.  \n  \n Activities constructed using <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity> interface with the designer using <xref:System.ComponentModel.ICustomTypeDescriptor>. Activities created in the designer can be loaded dynamically using <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A>, as demonstrated in the following procedure.  \n  \n#### To create an activity at runtime using imperative code  \n  \n1.  Open[!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Select **File**, **New**, **Project**. Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node. Select **Sequential Workflow Console Application** in the **Templates** window. Name the new project DynamicActivitySample.  \n  \n3.  Right-click Workflow1.xaml in the HelloActivity project and select **Delete**.  \n  \n4.  Open Program.cs. Add the following directive to the top of the file.  \n  \n    ```  \n    using System.Collections.Generic;  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Replace the contents of the `Main` method with the following code, which creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity that contains a single <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity and assigns it to the <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity.Implementation%2A> property of a new dynamic activity.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    //Define the input argument for the activity  \n    var textOut = new InArgument<string>();  \n    //Create the activity, property, and implementation  \n                Activity dynamicWorkflow = new DynamicActivity()  \n                {  \n                    Properties =   \n                    {  \n                        new DynamicActivityProperty  \n                        {  \n                            Name = \"Text\",  \n                            Type = typeof(InArgument<String>),  \n                            Value = textOut  \n                        }  \n                    },  \n                    Implementation = () => new Sequence()  \n                    {  \n                        Activities =   \n                        {  \n                            new WriteLine()  \n                            {  \n                                Text = new InArgument<string>(env => textOut.Get(env))  \n                            }  \n                        }  \n                    }  \n                };  \n    //Execute the activity with a parameter dictionary  \n                WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(dynamicWorkflow, new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"Text\", \"Hello World!\" } });  \n                Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Execute the application. A console window with the text \"Hello World!\" displays.  \n  \n#### To create an activity at runtime using XAML  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Select **File**, **New**, **Project**. Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node. Select  **Workflow Console Application** in the **Templates** window. Name the new project DynamicActivitySample.  \n  \n3.  Open Workflow1.xaml in the HelloActivity project. Click the **Arguments** option at the bottom of the designer. Create a new `In` argument called `TextToWrite` of type `String`.  \n  \n4.  Drag a **WriteLine** activity from the **Primitives** section of the toolbox onto the designer surface. Assign the value `TextToWrite` to the **Text** property of the activity.  \n  \n5.  Open Program.cs. Add the following directive to the top of the file.  \n  \n    ```  \n    using System.Activities.XamlIntegration;  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Replace the contents of the `Main` method with the following code.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Activity act2 = ActivityXamlServices.Load(@\"Workflow1.xaml\");  \n                    results = WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(act2, new Dictionary<string, object> { { \"TextToWrite\", \"HelloWorld!\" } });  \n    Console.ReadLine();  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  Execute the application. A console window with the text \"Hello World!\" appears.  \n  \n8.  Right-click the Workflow1.xaml file in the **Solution Explorer** and select **View Code**. Note that the activity class is created with `x:Class` and the property is created with `x:Property`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Authoring Workflows, Activities, and Expressions Using Imperative
