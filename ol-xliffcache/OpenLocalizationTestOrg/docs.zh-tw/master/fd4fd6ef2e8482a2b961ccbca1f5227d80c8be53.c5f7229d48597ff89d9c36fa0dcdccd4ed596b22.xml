By default, the restoration of dependencies and tools are performed in parallel.\n\nIn order to restore the dependencies, NuGet needs the feeds where the packages are located. Feeds are usually provided via the *NuGet.config* configuration file. A default configuration file is provided when the CLI tools are installed. You specify additional feeds by creating your own *NuGet.config* file in the project directory. You also specify additional feeds per invocation at a command prompt. \n\nFor dependencies, you specify where the restored packages are placed during the restore operation using the `--packages` argument. If not specified, the default NuGet package cache is used, which is found in the `.nuget/packages` directory in the user's home directory on all operating systems (for example, */home/user1* on Linux or *C:\\Users\\user1* on Windows).\n\nFor project-specific tooling, `dotnet restore` first restores the package in which the tool is packed, and then proceeds to restore the tool's dependencies as specified in its project file.\n\nThe behavior of the `dotnet restore` command is affected by some of the settings in the *Nuget.Config* file, if present. For example, setting the `globalPackagesFolder` in *NuGet.Config* places the restored NuGet packages in the specified folder. This is an alternative to specifying the `--packages` option on the `dotnet restore` command. For more information, see the [NuGet.Config reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/schema/nuget-config-file).\n\n## Arguments\n\n`ROOT` \n    \nOptional path to the project file to restore.\n\n## Options\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`-s|--source <SOURCE>`\n\nSpecifies a NuGet package source to use during the restore operation. This overrides all of the sources specified in the *NuGet.config* file(s). Multiple sources can be provided by specifying this option multiple times.\n\n`-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>`\n\nSpecifies a runtime for the package restore. This is used to restore packages for runtimes not explicitly listed in the `<RuntimeIdentifiers>` tag in the *.csproj* file. For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md). Provide multiple RIDs by specifying this option multiple times.\n\n`--packages <PACKAGES_DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the directory for restored packages. \n\n`--disable-parallel`\n\nDisables restoring multiple projects in parallel. \n\n`--configfile <FILE>`\n\nThe NuGet configuration file (*NuGet.config*) to use for the restore operation.\n\n`--no-cache`\n\nSpecifies to not cache packages and HTTP requests.\n\n`--ignore-failed-sources`\n\nOnly warn about failed sources if there are packages meeting the version requirement.\n\n`--no-dependencies`\n\nWhen restoring a project with project-to-project (P2P) references, restore the root project and not the references.\n\n`--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`.\n\n## Examples\n\nRestore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory:\n\n`dotnet restore` \n\nRestore dependencies and tools for the `app1` project found in the given path:\n\n`dotnet restore ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj`\n    \nRestore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the file path provided as the source:\n\n`dotnet restore -s c:\\packages\\mypackages` \n\nRestore the dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory using the two file paths provided as sources:\n\n`dotnet restore -s c:\\packages\\mypackages -s c:\\packages\\myotherpackages` \n\nRestore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory and shows only minimal output:\n\n`dotnet restore --verbosity minimal`\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,66],"content":"dotnet-restore command - .NET Core CLI | Microsoft
