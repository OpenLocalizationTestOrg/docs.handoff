The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography> namespace contains two implementations of the SHA1 algorithm, one purely managed implementation and one that wraps CryptoAPI. The developer can choose to instantiate a particular SHA1 implementation (such as the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1Managed>) by calling the **new** operator. However, if it does not matter which class the common language runtime loads as long as the class implements the SHA1 hash algorithm, the developer can create an object by calling the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. This method calls **System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(\"System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1\")**, which must return an implementation of the SHA1 hash algorithm.  \n  \n The developer can also call **System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(\"SHA1\")** because, by default, cryptography configuration includes short names for the algorithms shipped in the .NET Framework.  \n  \n If it does not matter which hash algorithm is used, the developer can call the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, which returns an object that implements a hashing transformation.  \n  \n## Mapping Algorithm Names in Configuration Files  \n By default, the runtime returns a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider> object for all four scenarios. However, a machine administrator can change the type of object that the methods in the last two scenarios return. To do this, you must map a friendly algorithm name to the class you want to use in the machine configuration file (Machine.config).  \n  \n The following example shows how to configure the runtime so that **System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1.Create**, **System.Security.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(\"SHA1\")**, and **System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm.Create** return a `MySHA1HashClass` object.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n   <!-- Other configuration settings. -->  \n   <mscorlib>  \n      <cryptographySettings>  \n         <cryptoNameMapping>  \n            <cryptoClasses>  \n               <cryptoClass MySHA1Hash=\"MySHA1HashClass, MyAssembly  \n                  Culture='en', PublicKeyToken=a5d015c7d5a0b012,  \n                  Version=1.0.0.0\"/>  \n            </cryptoClasses>  \n            <nameEntry name=\"SHA1\" class=\"MySHA1Hash\"/>  \n            <nameEntry name=\"System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1\"  \n                       class=\"MySHA1Hash\"/>  \n            <nameEntry name=\"System.Security.Cryptography.HashAlgorithm\"  \n                       class=\"MySHA1Hash\"/>  \n         </cryptoNameMapping>  \n      </cryptographySettings>  \n   </mscorlib>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n You can specify the name of the attribute in the [<cryptoClass\\> element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/cryptography/cryptoclass-element.md) (the previous example names the attribute `MySHA1Hash`). The value of the attribute in the **\\<cryptoClass>** element is a string that the common language runtime uses to find the class. You can use any string that meets the requirements specified in [Specifying Fully Qualified Type Names](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/specifying-fully-qualified-type-names.md).  \n  \n Many algorithm names can map to the same class. The [\\<nameEntry> element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/cryptography/nameentry-element.md) maps a class to one friendly algorithm name. The **name** attribute can be either a string that is used when calling the **System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName** method or the name of an abstract cryptography class in the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography> namespace. The value of the **class** attribute is the name of the attribute in the **\\<cryptoClass>** element.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can get an SHA1 algorithm by calling the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1.Create%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or the **Security.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(\"SHA1\")** method. Each method guarantees only that it returns an object that implements the SHA1 algorithm. You do not have to map each friendly name of an algorithm to the same class in the configuration file.  \n  \n For a list of default names and the classes they map to, see <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Cryptographic Services](../../../docs/standard/security/cryptographic-services.md)\n- [Configuring Cryptography
