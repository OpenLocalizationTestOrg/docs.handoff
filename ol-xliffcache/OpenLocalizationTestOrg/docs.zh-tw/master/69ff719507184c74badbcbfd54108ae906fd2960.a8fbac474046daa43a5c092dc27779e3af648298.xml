If there is no accessible constructor in the base class that can be called without arguments, or if there is more than one, Visual Basic cannot generate an implicit constructor.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30387  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Declare and implement at least one `Sub New` constructor somewhere in the derived class.  \n  \n2.  Add a call to a base class constructor, `MyBase.New()`, as the first line of every `Sub New`.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Object Lifetime: How Objects Are Created and
