Demonstrates how to extend the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model to support new outgoing response formats.  \n  \n [Automatic Format Selection](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/automatic-format-selection.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable automatic format selection (XML or JSON) with the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model, as well as how to explicitly set the format in the operation code.  \n  \n [Basic HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-http-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement an HTTP-based, RPC-based service - popularly referred to as \"POX\" (Plain Old XML) service – using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  \n  \n [Basic Resource Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-resource-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a HTTP-based service using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model that exposes a collection of customers that supports the retrieve, add, delete and replace operations.  \n  \n [AspNetRouteIntegration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/aspnetrouteintegration.md)  \n Demonstrates how to host a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP service using ASP.NET routes.  \n  \n [Conditional Get and Put](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/conditional-get-and-put.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the new conditional retrieve and update APIs for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  \n  \n [SOAP and HTTP Endpoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/soap-and-http-endpoints.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement an RPC-based service and expose it in the SOAP format and the \"Plain Old XML\" (POX) format using the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  \n  \n [ASP.NET Caching Integration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/aspnet-caching-integration.md)  \n Demonstrates how to utilize the ASP.NET output cache with the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web HTTP programming model.  \n  \n [UriTemplate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates the key concepts relating to <xref:System.UriTemplate>.  \n  \n [UriTemplate Table](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-table-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how the <xref:System.UriTemplateTable> class provides a dictionary-like associative table structure for working with a set of <xref:System.UriTemplate> instances.  \n  \n [UriTemplate Table Dispatcher](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/uritemplate-table-dispatcher-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates a basic dispatching engine built using <xref:System.UriTemplateTable>, a common usage scenario for the <xref:System.UriTemplateTable> class.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,32],"content":"Web | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Web | Microsoft
