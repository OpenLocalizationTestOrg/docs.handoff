Its <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2.Add*> method takes two parameters, one for the key and one for the value. To initialize a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2>, or any collection whose `Add` method takes multiple parameters, enclose each set of parameters in braces as shown in the following example.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following code example, a <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2> is initialized with instances of type `StudentName`.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#34](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-initialize-a-dictionary-with-a-collection-initializer_1.cs)]  \n  \n Note the two pairs of braces in each element of the collection. The innermost braces enclose the object initializer for the `StudentName`, and the outermost braces enclose the initializer for the key/value pair that will be added to the `students`<xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2>. Finally, the whole collection initializer for the dictionary is enclosed in braces.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To run this code, copy and paste the class into a Visual C# console application project that has been created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)]. By default, this project targets version 3.5 of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], and it has a reference to System.Core.dll and a using directive for System.Linq. If one or more of these requirements are missing from the project, you can add them manually.   \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Object and Collection Initializers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/object-and-collection-initializers.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,634],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-csharp\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"CSharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"collection initializers [C#], with Dictionary\"\nms.assetid: 25283922-f8ee-40dc-a639-fac30804ec71\ncaps.latest.revision: 10\nauthor: \"BillWagner\"\nms.author: \"wiwagn\"\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"\ntranslation.priority.mt: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,101],"content":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,101]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[641,725],"content":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Initialize a Dictionary with a Collection Initializer (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,84]}]},{"content":"A &lt;xref:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<ph id=\"ph1\">`2&gt; contains a collection of key/value pairs.
