This feature is an improvement over the date-selection feature of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control, which only enables the user to select a single date/time value. You can set a range of dates or get a selection range set by the user by using properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control. The following code example demonstrates how to set a selection range.  \n  \n### To select a range of dates  \n  \n1.  Create <xref:System.DateTime> objects that represent the first and last dates in a range.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim projectStart As Date = New DateTime(2001, 2, 13)  \n    Dim projectEnd As Date = New DateTime(2001, 2, 28)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    DateTime projectStart = new DateTime(2001, 2, 13);  \n    DateTime projectEnd = new DateTime(2001, 2, 28);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    DateTime projectStart = DateTime(2001, 2, 13);  \n    DateTime projectEnd = DateTime(2001, 2, 28);  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.SelectionRange%2A> property.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MonthCalendar1.SelectionRange = New SelectionRange(projectStart, projectEnd)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    monthCalendar1.SelectionRange = new SelectionRange(projectStart, projectEnd);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    monthCalendar1->SelectionRange = gcnew  \n       SelectionRange(projectStart, projectEnd);  \n    ```  \n  \n     –or–  \n  \n     Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.SelectionStart%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.SelectionEnd%2A> properties.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MonthCalendar1.SelectionStart = projectStart  \n    MonthCalendar1.SelectionEnd = projectEnd  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    monthCalendar1.SelectionStart = projectStart;  \n    monthCalendar1.SelectionEnd = projectEnd;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    monthCalendar1->SelectionStart = projectStart;  \n    monthCalendar1->SelectionEnd = projectEnd;  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [MonthCalendar Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/monthcalendar-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Change the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control's Appearance](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-monthcalendar-control-appearance.md)   \n [How to: Display Specific Days in Bold with the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/display-specific-days-in-bold-with-wf-monthcalendar-control.md)   \n [How to: Display More than One Month in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/display-more-than-one-month-wf-monthcalendar-control.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,660],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Select a Range of Dates in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,91],"content":"How to: Select a Range of Dates in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Select a Range of Dates in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,91]}]}],"pos":[6,100],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Select a Range of Dates in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
