For more information, see [How Entity SQL Differs from Transact-SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/how-entity-sql-differs-from-transact-sql.md).  \n  \n## Quantified Predicates  \n [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] allows constructs of the following form:  \n  \n```  \nsal > all (select salary from employees)  \nsal > any (select salary from employees)  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)], however, does not support such constructs. Equivalent expressions can be written in [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] as follows:  \n  \n```  \nnot exists(select 0 from employees as e where sal > e.salary)  \nexists(select 0 from employees as e where sal > e.salary)  \n```  \n  \n## * Operator  \n [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] supports the use of the * operator in the SELECT clause to indicate that all columns should be projected out.
