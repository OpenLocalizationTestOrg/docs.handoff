The Vbc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file, references the commonly used [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assemblies and imports the `System` and `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespaces.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-nostdlib` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `T2.vb` without referencing the standard libraries. You must set the `_MYTYPE` conditional-compilation constant to the string \"Empty\" to remove the `My` object.  \n  \n```console\nvbc -nostdlib -define:_MYTYPE=\\\"Empty\\\" T2.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [-noconfig](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/noconfig.md)\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)\n- [Customizing Which Objects are Available in My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/customizing-which-objects-are-available-in-my.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,268],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 03/13/2018\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"nostdlib compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"-nostdlib compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/nostdlib compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: 140381b8-dc96-4ad5-ae11-792c9ed0be4d","nodes":[{"content":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,24],"content":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,24]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[275,299],"content":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","linkify":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"-nostdlib (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Causes the compiler not to automatically reference the standard libraries.","pos":[300,374]},{"pos":[383,389],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[425,432],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-nostdlib`</ph> option removes the automatic reference to the System.dll assembly and prevents the compiler from reading the Vbc.rsp file.","pos":[436,574],"source":"The `-nostdlib` option removes the automatic reference to the System.dll assembly and prevents the compiler from reading the Vbc.rsp file."},{"content":"The Vbc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file, references the commonly used <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> assemblies and imports the <ph id=\"ph2\">`System`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">`Microsoft.VisualBasic`</ph> namespaces.","pos":[575,811],"source":" The Vbc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file, references the commonly used [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assemblies and imports the `System` and `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespaces."},{"pos":[819,910],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.","pos":[9,89]}]},{"pos":[918,1082],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `-nostdlib` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment;
