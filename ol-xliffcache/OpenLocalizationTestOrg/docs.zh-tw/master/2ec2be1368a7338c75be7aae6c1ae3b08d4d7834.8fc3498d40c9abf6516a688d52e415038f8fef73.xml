Create a WPF Application project named                                  `PropertyMappingWithWfhSample`.  \n  \n2.  In Solution Explorer, add a reference to the                                  WindowsFormsIntegration                                  assembly, which is named WindowsFormsIntegration.dll.  \n  \n3.
