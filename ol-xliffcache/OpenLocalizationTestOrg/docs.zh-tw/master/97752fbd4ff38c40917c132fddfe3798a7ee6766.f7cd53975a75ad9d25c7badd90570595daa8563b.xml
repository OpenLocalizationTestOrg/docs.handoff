Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula,  \n  \n (N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,151],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 4af18009-e778-490b-9ba6-e76485285830","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,67]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[158,225],"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second.","pos":[226,299]},{"pos":[308,319],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[323,467]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[468,490]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[500,545]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[555,622]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[632,711]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[721,809]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[819,853]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[863,972]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[982,1035]},{"pos":[1042,1211],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula,","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula,"},{"content":"(N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","pos":[1218,1251]}]}
