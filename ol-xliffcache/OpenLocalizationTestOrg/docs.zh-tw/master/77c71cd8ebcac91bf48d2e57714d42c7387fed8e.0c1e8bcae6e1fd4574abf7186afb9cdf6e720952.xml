For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing. For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md). For workflow services, you can also use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) configuration elements. For more details about WCF, see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  \n  \n Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor. Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute. This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [\\<system.serviceModel>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)  \n Describes the **ServiceModel** element.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,154],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.topic: \"reference\"\nms.assetid: 7ae70357-b150-4342-8f2a-d5eb6f9c6a0d","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[161,209],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","linkify":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) configuration elements enable you to configure workflow applications.","pos":[210,312]},{"content":"For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing.","pos":[313,400]},{"content":"For more information about tracking and tracing, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Workflow Tracking and Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)</ept>.","pos":[401,578],"source":" For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)."},{"content":"For workflow services, you can also use Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) configuration elements.","pos":[579,681]},{"content":"For more details about WCF, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WCF Configuration Schema<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md)</ept>.","pos":[682,812],"source":" For more details about WCF, see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md)."},{"content":"Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor.","pos":[819,953]},{"content":"Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute.","pos":[954,1037]},{"content":"This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.","pos":[1038,1105]},{"pos":[1114,1129],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>system.serviceModel&gt;<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)</ept>","pos":[1133,1278],"source":"[\\<system.serviceModel>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)"},{"content":"Describes the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ServiceModel<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> element.","pos":[1282,1321],"source":"Describes the **ServiceModel** element."}]}
