For example, if the ends of an association have multiplicities one (1) and many (*), the association is called a one-to-many association. In the example below, the `PublishedBy` association is a one-to-many association (a publisher publishes many books and a book is published by one publisher). The `WrittenBy` association is a many-to-many association (a book can have multiple authors and an author can write multiple books).  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `PublishedBy` and `WrittenBy`. The association ends for the `PublishedBy` association are the `Book` and `Publisher` entity types. The multiplicity of the `Publisher` end is one (1) and the multiplicity of the `Book` end is many (*).  \n  \n ![Example Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/examplemodel.gif \"ExampleModel\")  \n  \n The ADO.NET Entity Framework uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines the `PublishedBy` association shown in the diagram above:  \n  \n
