When this information is moved across an asynchronous code point, its lifetime is separated from that of the pointer against which the call was made. The original pointer can therefore be released.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:**
