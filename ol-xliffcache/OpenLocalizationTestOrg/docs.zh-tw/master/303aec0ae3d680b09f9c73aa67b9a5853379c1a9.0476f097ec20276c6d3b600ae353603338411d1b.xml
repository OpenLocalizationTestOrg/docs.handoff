It is better to simply say `if (true)` or `if (false)`. There are two reasons for this:  \n  \n-   It is simpler: it is always clearer to simply say what you mean.  \n  \n-   It helps avoid confusion: a new feature of C# 2.0 is nullable value types, which are analogous to the value `null` in T-SQL, the programming language used by SQL Server. Developers familiar with T-SQL might be concerned about the effect of nullable types on expressions such as `if (a == a)`, because of the use of ternary logic in T-SQL. If you use `true` or `false`, you avoid this possible confusion.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code generates warning CS1718.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS1718.cs  \nusing System;  \npublic class Tester   \n{  \n    public static void Main()   \n    {   \n        int i = 0;  \n        if (i == i) { // CS1718.cs  \n        //if (true) {   \n            i++;  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1718\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1718\"\nms.assetid: 7c1c11fd-4f91-482d-b8f7-efe2a361634e","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS1718","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Comparison made to same variable; did you mean to compare something else?","pos":[218,291]},{"content":"If you meant to compare to something else, then you should simply correct the statement.","pos":[298,386]},{"content":"But another possibility is that you were testing for true or false, and were doing so by statements such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`if (a == a) (true)`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`if (a &lt; a) (false)`</ph>.","pos":[393,546],"source":"But another possibility is that you were testing for true or false, and were doing so by statements such as `if (a == a) (true)` or `if (a < a) (false)`."},{"content":"It is better to simply say <ph id=\"ph1\">`if (true)`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`if (false)`</ph>.","pos":[547,602],"source":" It is better to simply say `if (true)` or `if (false)`."},{"content":"There are two reasons for this:","pos":[603,634]},{"content":"It is simpler: it is always clearer to simply say what you mean.","pos":[644,708]},{"content":"It helps avoid confusion: a new feature of C# 2.0 is nullable value types, which are analogous to the value <ph id=\"ph1\">`null`</ph> in T-SQL, the programming language used by SQL Server.","pos":[718,887],"source":"It helps avoid confusion: a new feature of C# 2.0 is nullable value types, which are analogous to the value `null` in T-SQL, the programming language used by SQL Server."},{"content":"Developers familiar with T-SQL might be concerned about the effect of nullable types on expressions such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`if (a == a)`</ph>, because of the use of ternary logic in T-SQL.","pos":[888,1056],"source":" Developers familiar with T-SQL might be concerned about the effect of nullable types on expressions such as `if (a == a)`, because of the use of ternary logic in T-SQL."},{"content":"If you use <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>, you avoid this possible confusion.","pos":[1057,1121],"source":" If you use `true` or `false`, you avoid this possible confusion."},{"pos":[1130,1137],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code generates warning CS1718.","pos":[1141,1185]}]}
