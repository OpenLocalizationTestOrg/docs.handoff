A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.\n  \n A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines. Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character. For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](~/_vblang/spec/lexical-grammar.md#line-terminators).\n  \n **Error ID:** BC30205\n  \n## To correct this error\n  \n1.  Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.\n  \n2.  Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.\n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)\n- [Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,186],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"End of statement expected\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30205\"\n  - \"vbc30205\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30205\"\nms.assetid: 53c7f825-a737-4b76-a1fa-f67745b8bd40","nodes":[{"content":"End of statement expected","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"End of statement expected","nodes":[{"content":"End of statement expected","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[193,218],"content":"End of statement expected","linkify":"End of statement expected","nodes":[{"content":"End of statement expected","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The statement is syntactically complete, but an additional programming element follows the element that completes the statement.","pos":[219,347]},{"content":"A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.","pos":[348,408]},{"content":"A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines.","pos":[413,495]},{"content":"Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&amp;HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&amp;HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character.","pos":[496,697],"source":" Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character."},{"content":"For more information about line terminators, see the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Language Specification<ept id=\"p1\">](~/_vblang/spec/lexical-grammar.md#line-terminators)</ept>.","pos":[698,841],"source":" For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](~/_vblang/spec/lexical-grammar.md#line-terminators)."},{"pos":[846,867],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30205","source":"**Error ID:** BC30205"},{"pos":[874,895],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.","pos":[903,989]},{"content":"Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.","pos":[997,1069]},{"pos":[1076,1084],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1088,1240],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)"},{"pos":[1243,1328],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Statements<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)</ept>","source":"[Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)"}]}
