The property name is the same as the setting name, and the property type is the same as the setting type. The setting's **Scope** indicates if the property is read-only; the property for an **Application** scope setting is read-only, while the property for a **User** scope setting is read-write. For more information, see [My.Settings Object](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example displays the value of the `Nickname` setting.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#14](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-application-settings_1.vb)]  \n  \n For this example to work, your application must have a `Nickname` setting, of type `String`.
