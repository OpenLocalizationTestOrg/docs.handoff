To cache an element, create a new instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache> class and assign it to the element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CacheMode%2A> property.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows how to reuse a cached element. The cached element is an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control that displays a large image. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control is cached as a bitmap by using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache> class, and the cache is reused by assigning it to a <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush>. The brush is assigned to the background of twenty-five buttons to show efficient reuse.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush#_BitmapCacheBrushXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/system.windows.media.bitmapcachebrush/cs/window1.xaml#_bitmapcachebrushxaml)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush>\n- <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CacheMode%2A>\n- [How to: Improve Rendering Performance by Caching an Element](how-to-improve-rendering-performance-by-caching-an-element.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,284],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BitmapCache [WPF], using\"\n  - \"cached element [WPF], use as a brush\"\n  - \"BitmapCacheBrush [WPF], using\"\n  - \"CacheMode [WPF], using\"\nms.assetid: d36e944a-866e-4baf-98c4-fd6a75f6fdd0","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[291,330],"content":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","linkify":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Cached Element as a Brush","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush&gt;</ph> class to reuse a cached element efficiently.","pos":[331,428],"source":"Use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush> class to reuse a cached element efficiently."},{"content":"To cache an element, create a new instance of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache&gt;</ph> class and assign it to the element's <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CacheMode%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[429,610],"source":" To cache an element, create a new instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache> class and assign it to the element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.CacheMode%2A> property."},{"pos":[619,626],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example shows how to reuse a cached element.","pos":[630,693]},{"content":"The cached element is an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image&gt;</ph> control that displays a large image.","pos":[694,792],"source":" The cached element is an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control that displays a large image."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image&gt;</ph> control is cached as a bitmap by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache&gt;</ph> class, and the cache is reused by assigning it to a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush&gt;</ph>.","pos":[793,1014],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control is cached as a bitmap by using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCache> class, and the cache is reused by assigning it to a <xref:System.Windows.Media.BitmapCacheBrush>."},{"content":"The brush is assigned to the background of twenty-five buttons to show efficient reuse.","pos":[1015,1102]},{"pos":[1310,1318],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1458,1582],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Improve Rendering Performance by Caching an Element<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-improve-rendering-performance-by-caching-an-element.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Improve Rendering Performance by Caching an Element](how-to-improve-rendering-performance-by-caching-an-element.md)"}]}
