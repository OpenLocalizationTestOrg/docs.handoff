One <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> contains text and the other contains an image. The image is in a folder called data, which is a subfolder of the example’s project folder. When a user clicks the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> that has the image, the background and the text of the other <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> change.  \n  \n This example creates <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls by using markup but uses code to write the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event handlers.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[BtnColor#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BtnColor/CSharp/Pane1.xaml#4)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[BtnColor#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BtnColor/CSharp/Pane1.xaml.cs#6)]\n [!code-vb[BtnColor#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BtnColor/VisualBasic/Pane1.xaml.vb#6)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Controls](index.md)\n- [Control Library](control-library.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,219],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Button controls [WPF], creating\"\nms.assetid: 607a193c-4098-4dd8-8dc0-51256cec2020","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[226,267],"content":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","linkify":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Button That Has an Image","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[268,354],"content":"This example shows how to include an image on a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph>.","source":"This example shows how to include an image on a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>."},{"pos":[363,370],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> controls.","pos":[374,455],"source":"The following example creates two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls."},{"content":"One <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> contains text and the other contains an image.","pos":[456,544],"source":" One <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> contains text and the other contains an image."},{"content":"The image is in a folder called data, which is a subfolder of the example’s project folder.","pos":[545,636]},{"content":"When a user clicks the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> that has the image, the background and the text of the other <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> change.","pos":[637,804],"source":" When a user clicks the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> that has the image, the background and the text of the other <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> change."},{"pos":[811,996],"content":"This example creates <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> controls by using markup but uses code to write the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click&gt;</ph> event handlers.","source":"This example creates <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> controls by using markup but uses code to write the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event handlers."},{"pos":[1325,1333],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1337,1357],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Controls](index.md)"},{"pos":[1360,1397],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Control Library<ept id=\"p1\">](control-library.md)</ept>","source":"[Control Library](control-library.md)"}]}
