queries](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)  \n Describes the three parts of the basic LINQ query operation that are common across all languages and data sources.  \n  \n [LINQ and generic types](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-generic-types.md)  \n Provides a brief introduction to generic types as they are used in LINQ.  \n  \n [Data transformations with LINQ](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/data-transformations-with-linq.md)  \n Describes the various ways that you can transform data retrieved in queries.  \n  \n [Type relationships in LINQ query operations](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md)  \n Describes how types are preserved and/or transformed in the three parts of a LINQ query operation  \n  \n [Query syntax and method syntax in LINQ](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq.md)  \n Compares method syntax and query syntax as two ways to express a LINQ query.  \n  \n [C# features that support LINQ](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/features-that-support-linq.md)  \n Describes the language constructs in C# that support LINQ.  \n   \n## Related sections  \n [LINQ query expressions](../programming-guide/linq-query-expressions/index.md)  \n Includes an overview of queries in LINQ and provides links to additional resources.  \n  \n [Standard query operators overview](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/standard-query-operators-overview.md)  \n Introduces the standard methods used in LINQ.  \n
