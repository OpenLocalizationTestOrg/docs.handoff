New C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] use C# expressions, and Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. Existing [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] workflow projects that use Visual Basic expressions can be migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] regardless of the project language and are supported. This topic provides an overview of C# expressions in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)].  \n  \n## Using C# expressions in workflows  \n  \n-   [Using C# expressions in the Workflow Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#WFDesigner)  \n  \n    -   [Backwards compatibility](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#BackwardCompat)  \n  \n-   [Using C# expressions in code workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows)  \n  \n-   [Using C# expressions in XAML workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#XamlWorkflows)  \n  \n    -   [Compiled Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CompiledXaml)  \n  \n    -   [Loose Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#LooseXaml)  \n  \n-   [Using C# expressions in XAMLX workflow services](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#WFServices)  \n  \n###  <a name=\"WFDesigner\"></a> Using C# expressions in the Workflow Designer  \n Starting with [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)]. C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] use C# expressions, while Visual Basic workflow projects use Visual Basic expressions. To specify the desired C# expression, type it into the box labeled **Enter a C# expression**. This label is displayed in the properties window when the activity is selected in the designer, or on the activity in the workflow designer. In the following example, two `WriteLine` activities are contained within a `Sequence` inside a `NoPersistScope`.  \n  \n ![Automatically created sequence activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/media/autosurround2.png \"AutoSurround2\")  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  C# expressions are supported only in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], and are not supported in the re-hosted workflow designer. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] new WF45 features supported in the re-hosted designer, see [Support for New Workflow Foundation 4.5 Features in the Rehosted Workflow Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/wf-features-in-the-rehosted-workflow-designer.md).  \n  \n####  <a name=\"BackwardCompat\"></a> Backwards compatibility  \n Visual Basic expressions in existing [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)] C# workflow projects that have been migrated to [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] are supported. When the Visual Basic expressions are viewed in the workflow designer, the text of the existing Visual Basic expression is replaced with **Value was set in XAML**, unless the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax. If the Visual Basic expression is valid C# syntax, then the expression is displayed. To update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, you can edit them in the workflow designer and specify the equivalent C# expression. It is not required to update the Visual Basic expressions to C#, but once the expressions are updated in the workflow designer they are converted to C# and may not be reverted to Visual Basic.  \n  \n###  <a name=\"CodeWorkflows\"></a> Using C# expressions in code workflows  \n C# expressions are supported in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] code based workflows, but before the workflow can be invoked the C# expressions must be compiled using <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.TextExpressionCompiler.Compile%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. Workflow authors can use `CSharpValue` to represent the r-value of an expression, and `CSharpReference` to represent the l-value of an expression. In the following example, a workflow is created with an `Assign` activity and a `WriteLine` activity contained in a `Sequence` activity. A `CSharpReference` is specified for the `To` argument of the `Assign`, and represents the l-value of the expression. A `CSharpValue` is specified for the `Value` argument of the `Assign`, and for the `Text` argument of the `WriteLine`, and represents the r-value for those two expressions.  \n  \n```csharp  \nVariable<int> n = new Variable<int>  \n{  \n    Name = \"n\"  \n};  \n  \nActivity wf = new Sequence  \n{  \n    Variables = { n },  \n    Activities =  \n    {  \n        new Assign<int>  \n        {  \n            To = new CSharpReference<int>(\"n\"),  \n            Value = new CSharpValue<int>(\"new Random().Next(1, 101)\")  \n        },  \n        new WriteLine  \n        {  \n            Text = new CSharpValue<string>(\"\\\"The number is \\\" + n\")  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n  \nCompileExpressions(wf);  \n  \nWorkflowInvoker.Invoke(wf);  \n```  \n  \n After the workflow is constructed, the C# expressions are compiled by calling the `CompileExpressions` helper method and then the workflow is invoked. The following example is the `CompileExpressions` method.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)  \n{  \n    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  \n    // C# expressions.  \n    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();  \n  \n    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  \n    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  \n    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  \n    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + \"_CompiledExpressionRoot\";  \n    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  \n    string activityNamespace = string.Join(\".\", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  \n  \n    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  \n    {  \n        Activity = activity,  \n        Language = \"C#\",  \n        ActivityName = activityType,  \n        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  \n        RootNamespace = null,  \n        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  \n        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  \n        ForImplementation = false  \n    };  \n  \n    // Compile the C# expression.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  \n        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  \n  \n    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  \n    if (results.HasErrors)  \n    {  \n        throw new Exception(\"Compilation failed.\");  \n    }  \n  \n    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  \n    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  \n        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  \n            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  \n  \n    // Attach it to the activity.  \n    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot(  \n        activity, compiledExpressionRoot);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the C# expressions are not compiled, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> is thrown when the workflow is invoked with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`  \n  \n If your custom code based workflow uses `DynamicActivity`, then some changes to the `CompileExpressions` method are required, as demonstrated in the following code example.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic void CompileExpressions(DynamicActivity dynamicActivity)  \n{  \n    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  \n    // C# expressions. For Dynamic Activities this can be retrieved using the  \n    // name property , which must be in the form Namespace.Type.  \n    string activityName = dynamicActivity.Name;  \n  \n    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  \n    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  \n    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  \n    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + \"_CompiledExpressionRoot\";  \n    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  \n    string activityNamespace = string.Join(\".\", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  \n  \n    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  \n    {  \n        Activity = dynamicActivity,  \n        Language = \"C#\",  \n        ActivityName = activityType,  \n        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  \n        RootNamespace = null,  \n        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  \n        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  \n        ForImplementation = true  \n    };  \n  \n    // Compile the C# expression.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  \n        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  \n  \n    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  \n    if (results.HasErrors)  \n    {  \n        throw new Exception(\"Compilation failed.\");  \n    }  \n  \n    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  \n    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  \n        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  \n            new object[] { dynamicActivity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  \n  \n    // Attach it to the activity.  \n    CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation(  \n        dynamicActivity, compiledExpressionRoot);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n There are several differences in the `CompileExpressions` overload that compiles the C# expressions in a dynamic activity.  \n  \n-   The parameter to `CompileExpressions` is a `DynamicActivity`.  \n  \n-   The type name and namespace are retrieved using the `DynamicActivity.Name` property.  \n  \n-   `TextExpressionCompilerSettings.ForImplementation` is set to `true`.  \n  \n-   `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRootForImplementation` is called instead of `CompiledExpressionInvoker.SetCompiledExpressionRoot`.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] working with expressions in code, see [Authoring Workflows, Activities, and Expressions Using Imperative Code](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/authoring-workflows-activities-and-expressions-using-imperative-code.md).  \n  \n###  <a name=\"XamlWorkflows\"></a> Using C# expressions in XAML workflows  \n C# expressions are supported in XAML workflows. Compiled XAML workflows are compiled into a type, and loose XAML workflows are loaded by the runtime and compiled into an activity tree when the workflow is executed.  \n  \n-   [Compiled Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CompiledXaml)  \n  \n-   [Loose Xaml](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#LooseXaml)  \n  \n####  <a name=\"CompiledXaml\"></a> Compiled Xaml  \n C# expressions are supported in compiled XAML workflows that are compiled to a type as part of a C# workflow project that targets [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)]. Compiled XAML is the default type of workflow authoring in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], and C# workflow projects created in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] that target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] use C# expressions.  \n  \n####  <a name=\"LooseXaml\"></a> Loose Xaml  \n C# expressions are supported in loose XAML workflows. The workflow host program that loads and invokes the loose XAML workflow must target [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)], and <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> must be set to `true` (the default is `false`). To set <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> to `true`, create an <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings> instance with its <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServicesSettings.CompileExpressions%2A> property set to `true`, and pass it as a parameter to <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. If `CompileExpressions` Is not set to `true`, a <xref:System.NotSupportedException> will be thrown with a message similar to the following: `Expression Activity type 'CSharpValue`1' requires compilation in order to run.  Please ensure that the workflow has been compiled.`  \n  \n```csharp  \nActivityXamlServicesSettings settings = new ActivityXamlServicesSettings  \n{  \n    CompileExpressions = true  \n};  \n  \nDynamicActivity<int> wf = ActivityXamlServices.Load(new StringReader(serializedAB), settings) as DynamicActivity<int>;  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] working with XAML workflows, see [Serializing Workflows and Activities to and from XAML](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/serializing-workflows-and-activities-to-and-from-xaml.md).  \n  \n###  <a name=\"WFServices\"></a> Using C# expressions in XAMLX workflow services  \n C# expressions are supported in XAMLX workflow services. When a workflow service is hosted in IIS or WAS then no additional steps are required, but if the XAML workflow service is self-hosted, then the C# expressions must be compiled. To compile the C# expressions in a self-hosted XAMLX workflow service, first load the XAMLX file into a `WorkflowService`, and then pass the `Body` of the `WorkflowService` to the `CompileExpressions` method described in the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section. In the following example, a XAMLX workflow service is loaded, the C# expressions are compiled, and then the workflow service is opened and waits for requests.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Load the XAMLX workflow service.  \nWorkflowService workflow1 =  \n    (WorkflowService)XamlServices.Load(xamlxPath);  \n  \n// Compile the C# expressions in the workflow by passing the Body to CompileExpressions.  \nCompileExpressions(workflow1.Body);  \n  \n// Initialize the WorkflowServiceHost.  \nvar host = new WorkflowServiceHost(workflow1, new Uri(\"http://localhost:8293/Service1.xamlx\"));  \n  \n// Enable Metadata publishing/  \nServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();  \nsmb.HttpGetEnabled = true;  \nsmb.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion = PolicyVersion.Policy15;  \nhost.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);  \n  \n// Open the WorkflowServiceHost and wait for requests.  \nhost.Open();  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Press enter to quit\");  \nConsole.ReadLine();  \n```  \n  \n If the C# expressions are not compiled, the `Open` operation succeeds but the workflow will fail when it is invoked. The following `CompileExpressions` method is the same as the method from the previous [Using C# expressions in code workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md#CodeWorkflows) section.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic void CompileExpressions(Activity activity)  \n{  \n    // activityName is the Namespace.Type of the activity that contains the  \n    // C# expressions.  \n    string activityName = activity.GetType().ToString();  \n  \n    // Split activityName into Namespace and Type.Append _CompiledExpressionRoot to the type name  \n    // to represent the new type that represents the compiled expressions.  \n    // Take everything after the last . for the type name.  \n    string activityType = activityName.Split('.').Last() + \"_CompiledExpressionRoot\";  \n    // Take everything before the last . for the namespace.  \n    string activityNamespace = string.Join(\".\", activityName.Split('.').Reverse().Skip(1).Reverse());  \n  \n    // Create a TextExpressionCompilerSettings.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerSettings settings = new TextExpressionCompilerSettings  \n    {  \n        Activity = activity,  \n        Language = \"C#\",  \n        ActivityName = activityType,  \n        ActivityNamespace = activityNamespace,  \n        RootNamespace = null,  \n        GenerateAsPartialClass = false,  \n        AlwaysGenerateSource = true,  \n        ForImplementation = false  \n    };  \n  \n    // Compile the C# expression.  \n    TextExpressionCompilerResults results =  \n        new TextExpressionCompiler(settings).Compile();  \n  \n    // Any compilation errors are contained in the CompilerMessages.  \n    if (results.HasErrors)  \n    {  \n        throw new Exception(\"Compilation failed.\");  \n    }  \n  \n    // Create an instance of the new compiled expression type.  \n    ICompiledExpressionRoot compiledExpressionRoot =  \n        Activator.CreateInstance(results.ResultType,  \n            new object[] { activity }) as ICompiledExpressionRoot;  \n  \n    // Attach it to the activity.  \n
