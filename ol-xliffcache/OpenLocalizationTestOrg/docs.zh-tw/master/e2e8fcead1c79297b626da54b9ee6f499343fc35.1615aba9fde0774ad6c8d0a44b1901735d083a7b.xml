Open the HostingApplication project you created in [Task 1: Create a New Windows Presentation Foundation Application](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/task-1-create-a-new-wpf-app.md).  \n  \n2.  Adjust the size of the window to make it easier to use the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)]. To do this, select **MainWindow** in the designer, press F4 to display the **Properties** window, and, in the **Layout** section there, set the **Width** to a value of 600 and the **Height** to a value of 350.  \n  \n3.  Set the grid name by selecting the **Grid** panel in the designer (click the box inside the **MainWindow**) and setting the **Name** property at the top of the **Properties** window to \"grid1\".  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, click the ellipsis (**â€¦**) next to the `ColumnDefinitions` property to open the **Collection Editor** dialog box.  \n  \n5.  In the **Collection Editor** dialog box, click the **Add** button three times to insert three columns into the layout. The first column will contain the **Toolbox**, the second column will host the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)], and the third column will be used for the property inspector.  \n  \n6.  Set the `Width` property of the middle column to the value \"4*\".  \n  \n7.  Click **OK** to save the changes. The following XAML is added to your MainWindow.xaml file:  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    <Grid Name=\"grid1\">  \n        <Grid.ColumnDefinitions>  \n            <ColumnDefinition />  \n            <ColumnDefinition Width=\"4*\" />  \n            <ColumnDefinition />  \n        </Grid.ColumnDefinitions>  \n    </Grid>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n8.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click MainWindow.xaml and select **View Code**. Modify the code by following these steps:  \n  \n    1.  Add the following namespaces:  \n  \n        ```csharp  \n  \n        using System.Activities;  \n        using System.Activities.Core.Presentation;  \n        using System.Activities.Presentation;  \n        using System.Activities.Presentation.Metadata;  \n        using System.Activities.Presentation.Toolbox;  \n        using System.Activities.Statements;  \n        using System.ComponentModel;  \n  \n        ```  \n  \n    2.  To declare a private member field to hold an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, add the following code to the `MainWindow` class.  \n  \n        ```csharp  \n  \n        public partial class MainWindow : Window  \n        {  \n            private WorkflowDesigner wd;  \n  \n            public MainWindow()  \n            {  \n                InitializeComponent();  \n            }  \n        }  \n  \n        ```  \n  \n    3.  Add the following `AddDesigner` method to the `MainWindow` class. The implementation creates an instance of the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>, adds a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity to it, and places it in middle column of the grid1 **Grid**.  \n  \n        ```csharp  \n  \n        private void AddDesigner()  \n        {  \n            //Create an instance of WorkflowDesigner class.  \n            this.wd = new WorkflowDesigner();  \n  \n            //Place the designer canvas in the middle column of the grid.  \n            Grid.SetColumn(this.wd.View, 1);  \n  \n            //Load a new Sequence as default.  \n            this.wd.Load(new Sequence());  \n  \n            //Add the designer canvas to the grid.  \n            grid1.Children.Add(this.wd.View);  \n        }  \n  \n        ```  \n  \n    4.  Register the designer metadata to add designer support for all the  built-in activities. This enables you to drop activities from the toolbox onto the original <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity in the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)]. To do this, add the `RegisterMetadata` method to the `MainWindow` class.  \n  \n        ```csharp  \n  \n        private void RegisterMetadata()  \n        {               \n            DesignerMetadata dm = new DesignerMetadata();  \n            dm.Register();  \n        }  \n  \n        ```  \n  \n         [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] registering activity designers, see [How to: Create a Custom Activity Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-custom-activity-designer.md).  \n  \n    5.  In the `MainWindow` class constructor, add calls to the methods declared previously to register the metadata for designer support and to create the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowDesigner>.  \n  \n        ```csharp  \n        public MainWindow()  \n        {  \n            InitializeComponent();  \n  \n            // Register the metadata  \n            RegisterMetadata();  \n  \n            // Add the WFF Designer  \n            AddDesigner();  \n        }  \n  \n        ```  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  The `RegisterMetadata` method registers the designer metadata of built-in activities including the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. Because the `AddDesigner` method uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, the `RegisterMetadata` method must be called first.  \n  \n9. Press F5 to build and run the solution.  \n  \n10. See [Task 3: Create the Toolbox and PropertyGrid Panes](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/task-3-create-the-toolbox-and-propertygrid-panes.md) to learn how to add **Toolbox** and **PropertyGrid** support to your rehosted workflow designer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Rehosting the Workflow
