As long as the counter is greater than zero, thread aborts for the current thread are delayed. If this call is not paired with a call to the `EndPreventAsyncAbort` method, it is possible to reach a state in which thread aborts cannot be delivered to the current thread.  \n  \n The delay is not honored for a thread that aborts itself.  \n  \n The functionality that is exposed by this feature is used internally by the virtual machine (VM). Misuse of these methods may cause unspecified behavior in the VM. For example, calling `EndPreventAsyncAbort` without first calling `BeginPreventAsyncAbort` could set the counter to zero when the VM has previously incremented it. Similarly, the internal counter is not checked for overflow. If it exceeds its integral limit because it is incremented by both the host and the VM, the resulting behavior is unspecified.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
