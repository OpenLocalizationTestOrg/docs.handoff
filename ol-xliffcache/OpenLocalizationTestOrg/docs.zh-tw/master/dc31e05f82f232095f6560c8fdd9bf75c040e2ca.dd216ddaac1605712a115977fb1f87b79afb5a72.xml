They can be found under the `ServiceModelService 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe). The instances are named using the following pattern:  \n  \n```  \nServiceName@ServiceBaseAddress  \n```  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name.
