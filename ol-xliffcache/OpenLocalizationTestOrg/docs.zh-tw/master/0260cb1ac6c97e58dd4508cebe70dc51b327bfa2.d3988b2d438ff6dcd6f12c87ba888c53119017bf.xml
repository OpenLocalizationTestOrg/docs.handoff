[!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/linq_dataset_md.md)] provides richer, optimized querying over the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] enables you to directly query [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database schemas, and [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/linq_entities_md.md)] allows you to query an [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/adonet_edm_md.md)].  \n  \n## LINQ to DataSet  \n The <xref:System.Data.DataSet> is one of the most widely used components in [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vstecado_md.md)], and is a key element of the disconnected programming model that [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vstecado_md.md)] is built on. Despite this prominence, however, the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> has limited query capabilities.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/linq_dataset_md.md)] enables you to build richer query capabilities into <xref:System.Data.DataSet> by using the same query functionality that is available for many other data sources.  \n  \n For more information, see [LINQ to DataSet](../../../../framework/data/adonet/linq-to-dataset.md).  \n  \n## LINQ to SQL  \n [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] provides a run-time infrastructure for managing relational data as objects. In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)], the data model of a relational database is mapped to an object model expressed in the programming language of the developer. When you execute the application, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] translates language-integrated queries in the object model into SQL and sends them to the database for execution. When the database returns the results, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] translates them back into objects that you can manipulate.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] includes support for stored procedures and user-defined functions in the database, and for inheritance in the object model.  \n  \n For more information, see [LINQ to SQL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb386976).  \n  \n## LINQ to Entities  \n Through the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/adonet_edm_md.md)], relational data is exposed as objects in the .NET environment. This makes the object layer an ideal target for [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] support, allowing developers to formulate queries against the database from the language used to build the business logic. This capability is known as [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/linq_entities_md.md)].
