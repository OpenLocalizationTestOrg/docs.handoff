The first list box contains three list items.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[LinqExample#UI](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LinqExample/CSharp/Window1.xaml#ui)]  \n  \n Selecting an item from the first list box invokes the following event handler. In this example, `Tasks` is a collection of `Task` objects. The `Task` class has a property named `Priority`. This event handler runs a LINQ query that returns the collection of `Task` objects that have the selected priority value, and then sets that as the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A>:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinqExample#Using](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LinqExample/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#using)]  \n[!code-csharp[LinqExample#Tasks](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LinqExample/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#tasks)]  \n[!code-csharp[LinqExample#Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LinqExample/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#handler)]  \n  \n The second list box binds to that collection because its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemsSource%2A> value is set to `{Binding}`. As a result, it displays the returned collection (based on the `myTaskTemplate`<xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate>).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Make Data Available for Binding in XAML](how-to-make-data-available-for-binding-in-xaml.md)\n- [Bind to a Collection and Display Information Based on Selection](how-to-bind-to-a-collection-and-display-information-based-on-selection.md)\n- [What's New in WPF Version 4.5](../getting-started/whats-new.md)\n- [Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,241],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"running a LINQ query [WPF], bind to results\"\n  - \"binding to LINQ query results [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: ff2844d9-17ed-4ea6-aab1-5111af0bc684","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[248,291],"content":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","linkify":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind to the Results of a LINQ Query","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"This example demonstrates how to run a LINQ query and then bind to the results.","pos":[292,371]},{"pos":[380,387],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates two list boxes.","pos":[391,436]},{"content":"The first list box contains three list items.","pos":[437,482]},{"content":"Selecting an item from the first list box invokes the following event handler.","pos":[602,680]},{"content":"In this example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`Tasks`</ph> is a collection of <ph id=\"ph2\">`Task`</ph> objects.","pos":[681,740],"source":" In this example, `Tasks` is a collection of `Task` objects."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Task`</ph> class has a property named <ph id=\"ph2\">`Priority`</ph>.","pos":[741,790],"source":" The `Task` class has a property named `Priority`."},{"content":"This event handler runs a LINQ query that returns the collection of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Task`</ph> objects that have the selected priority value, and then sets that as the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A&gt;</ph>:","pos":[791,993],"source":" This event handler runs a LINQ query that returns the collection of `Task` objects that have the selected priority value, and then sets that as the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A>:"},{"content":"The second list box binds to that collection because its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemsSource%2A&gt;</ph> value is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`{Binding}`</ph>.","pos":[1368,1512],"source":"The second list box binds to that collection because its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemsSource%2A> value is set to `{Binding}`."},{"content":"As a result, it displays the returned collection (based on the <ph id=\"ph1\">`myTaskTemplate`</ph><ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate&gt;</ph>).","pos":[1513,1628],"source":" As a result, it displays the returned collection (based on the `myTaskTemplate`<xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate>)."},{"pos":[1637,1645],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1649,1741],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Make Data Available for Binding in XAML<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-make-data-available-for-binding-in-xaml.md)</ept>","source":"[Make Data Available for Binding in XAML](how-to-make-data-available-for-binding-in-xaml.md)"},{"pos":[1744,1884],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Bind to a Collection and Display Information Based on Selection<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-bind-to-a-collection-and-display-information-based-on-selection.md)</ept>","source":"[Bind to a Collection and Display Information Based on Selection](how-to-bind-to-a-collection-and-display-information-based-on-selection.md)"},{"pos":[1887,1951],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>What's New in WPF Version 4.5<ept id=\"p1\">](../getting-started/whats-new.md)</ept>","source":"[What's New in WPF Version 4.5](../getting-started/whats-new.md)"},{"pos":[1954,2003],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Data Binding Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](data-binding-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)"},{"pos":[2006,2052],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)"}]}
