For this reason, every attribute must use values that are constant at compile time, and therefore every attribute argument must evaluate to a compile-time constant value.  \n  \n Certain type conversions cannot produce values that are constant at compile time. For example, converting a `String` to a `Double` or a `Date` depends on the locale setting at run time. Other conversions, such as an array of a derived type to an array of `Object`, present a variety of problems that do not permit the compiler to allow them on attribute arguments.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30934  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Use an expression that evaluates to the same data type as the corresponding parameter, as defined by the attribute.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NOT IN BUILD: Attributes in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/620bfc0e-4582-4c8b-8432-ebc5c3dccc22)   \n [NOT IN BUILD: Application of Attributes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2b1703ed-4437-49b3-bc0b-568094324f47)   \n [Const Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/const-statement.md)   \n [Type Conversions in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-conversions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,169],"content":"Conversion from &#39;&lt;type1&gt;&#39;
