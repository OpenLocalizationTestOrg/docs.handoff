A metafile, also called a vector image, is an image that is stored as a sequence of drawing commands and settings. The commands and settings recorded in a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object can be stored in memory or saved to a file or stream.  \n  \n## Metafile Formats  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] can display metafiles that have been stored in the following formats:  \n  \n-   Windows Metafile (WMF)  \n  \n-   Enhanced Metafile (EMF)  \n  \n-   EMF+  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] can record metafiles in the EMF and EMF+ formats, but not in the WMF format.  \n  \n EMF+ is an extension to EMF that allows [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] records to be stored. There are two variations on the EMF+ format: EMF+ Only and EMF+ Dual. EMF+ Only metafiles contain only [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] records. Such metafiles can be displayed by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] but not by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)]. EMF+ Dual metafiles contain [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] records. Each [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] record in an EMF+ Dual metafile is paired with an alternate [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] record. Such metafiles can be displayed by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] or by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)].  \n  \n The following example displays a metafile that was previously saved as a file.
