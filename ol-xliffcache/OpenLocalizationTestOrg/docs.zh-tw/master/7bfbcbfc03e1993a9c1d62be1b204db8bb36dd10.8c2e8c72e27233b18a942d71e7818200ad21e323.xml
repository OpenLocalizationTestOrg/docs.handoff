The built-in operators usually implement the reference equality, and many developers are surprised when the default behavior is changed to the value equality.  \n  \n This problem is mitigated for immutable reference types because immutability makes it much harder to notice the difference between reference equality and value equality.  \n  \n **X AVOID** overloading equality operators on reference types if the implementation would be significantly slower than that of reference equality.  \n  \n *Portions © 2005, 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
