Calling conventions deal with number, type, and order of arguments. Your program may be calling a routine in a DLL that is being passed the wrong type or number of arguments.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Make sure all argument types agree with those specified in the declaration of the routine that you are calling.  \n  \n2.  Make sure you are passing the same number of arguments indicated in the declaration of the routine that you are calling.  \n  \n3.  If the DLL routine expects arguments by value, make sure `ByVal` is specified for those arguments in the declaration for the routine.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Error Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/error-types.md)\n- [Call Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/call-statement.md)\n- [Declare Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,136],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Bad DLL calling convention\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID49\"\nms.assetid: 7c7def45-b0ab-450f-ad3f-4383dfd9aed7","nodes":[{"content":"Bad DLL calling convention","nodes":[{"pos":[0,26],"content":"Bad DLL calling convention","nodes":[{"content":"Bad DLL calling convention","pos":[0,26]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[143,169],"content":"Bad DLL calling convention","linkify":"Bad DLL calling convention","nodes":[{"content":"Bad DLL calling convention","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Arguments passed to a dynamic-link library (DLL) must exactly match those expected by the routine.","pos":[170,268]},{"content":"Calling conventions deal with number, type, and order of arguments.","pos":[269,336]},{"content":"Your program may be calling a routine in a DLL that is being passed the wrong type or number of arguments.","pos":[337,443]},{"pos":[452,473],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Make sure all argument types agree with those specified in the declaration of the routine that you are calling.","pos":[483,594]},{"content":"Make sure you are passing the same number of arguments indicated in the declaration of the routine that you are calling.","pos":[604,724]},{"pos":[734,867],"content":"If the DLL routine expects arguments by value, make sure <ph id=\"ph1\">`ByVal`</ph> is specified for those arguments in the declaration for the routine.","source":"If the DLL routine expects arguments by value, make sure `ByVal` is specified for those arguments in the declaration for the routine."},{"pos":[876,884],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[888,975],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Error Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/error-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Error Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/error-types.md)"},{"pos":[978,1065],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Call Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/call-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Call Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/call-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1068,1161],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Declare Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Declare Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md)"}]}
