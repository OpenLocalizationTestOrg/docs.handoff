This can occur if a required DLL is not also included in the compilation with **/reference**.  \n  \n For more information, see [Add Reference Dialog Box](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2feb0fe2-0805-4cc9-8cba-b0315849dfb7) and [/reference (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// CS0011_1.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \n  \npublic class Outer   \n{  \n   public class B { }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The second file creates a DLL that defines a class `C` that is derived from the class `B` that was created in the previous example.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0011_2.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /reference:CS0011_1.dll  \n// post-build command: del /f CS0011_1.dll  \npublic class C : Outer.B {}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The third file replaces the DLL created by the first step, and omits the definition of the inner class `B`.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0011_3.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /out:cs0011_1.dll  \npublic class Outer {}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n Finally, the fourth file references the class `C` defined in the second example, which is derived from class `B`, and which is now missing.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0011.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0011_4.cs  \n// compile with: /reference:CS0011_1.dll /reference:CS0011_2.dll  \n// CS0011 expected  \n  \nclass M  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n      C c = new C();
