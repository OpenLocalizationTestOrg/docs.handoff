Check the spelling of variables in the expression. A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.  \n  \n2.  Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Passing Arguments by Value and by Reference](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-value-and-by-reference.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,156],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID11\"\nms.assetid: 5b9bc5d6-792e-48bc-a974-012e07ad95f3","nodes":[{"content":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","nodes":[{"content":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[163,209],"content":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","linkify":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","nodes":[{"content":"Division by zero (Visual Basic Run-Time Error)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"An expression being used as a divisor has a value of zero.","pos":[210,268]},{"pos":[277,298],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check the spelling of variables in the expression.","pos":[308,358]},{"content":"A misspelled variable name can implicitly create a numeric variable that is initialized to zero.","pos":[359,455]},{"content":"Check previous operations on variables in the expression, especially those passed into the procedure as arguments from other procedures.","pos":[465,601]},{"pos":[610,618],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[622,781],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Passing Arguments by Value and by Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-value-and-by-reference.md)</ept>","source":"[Passing Arguments by Value and by Reference](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-value-and-by-reference.md)"}]}
