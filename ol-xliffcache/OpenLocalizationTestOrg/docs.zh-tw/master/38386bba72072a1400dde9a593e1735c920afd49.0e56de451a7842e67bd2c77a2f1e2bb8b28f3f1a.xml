Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the `FileOpen` statement's `Len` clause.  \n  \n2.  If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.  \n  \n3.  If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FileGet%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FileGetObject%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FilePut%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FilePutObject%2A>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,46],"content":"Bad record length | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Bad record length | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,34]}]},{"pos":[533,550],"content":"Bad record length","linkify":"Bad record length","nodes":[{"content":"Bad record length","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Among the possible causes of this error are:","pos":[551,595]},{"pos":[605,795],"content":"The length of a record variable specified in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FileGet`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`FileGetObject`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement differs from the length specified in the corresponding <ph id=\"ph5\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"The length of a record variable specified in a `FileGet`, `FileGetObject`, `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement differs from the length specified in the corresponding `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[805,902],"content":"The variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement is or includes a variable-length string.","source":"The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string."},{"pos":[912,994],"content":"The variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> is or includes a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Variant`</ph>type<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant`type**.**"},{"pos":[1003,1024],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1034,1227],"content":"Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement's <ph id=\"ph2\">`Len`</ph> clause.","source":"Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the `FileOpen` statement's `Len` clause."},{"pos":[1237,1489],"content":"If the variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the <ph id=\"ph3\">`Len`</ph> clause of the <ph id=\"ph4\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[1499,1722],"content":"If the variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> is or includes a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Variant`</ph> make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the <ph id=\"ph4\">`Len`</ph> clause of the <ph id=\"ph5\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[1731,1739],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
