The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure with matching parameters, types, and return type may be used to create an instance of this delegate type. Each delegate class defines a constructor that is passed the specification of an object method.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30408  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Check the signatures to find the mismatch, and correct it.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Delegate Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,244],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Method '<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '<delegatename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30408\"\n  - \"vbc30408\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30408\"\nms.assetid: 845f6686-388f-4253-b635-146e517015a1","nodes":[{"content":"Method '<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '<delegatename>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,83],"content":"Method '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;methodname&gt;</ph>' does not have the same signature as delegate '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;delegatename&gt;</ph>'","source":"Method '<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '<delegatename>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[251,336],"content":"Method '\\<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '\\<delegatename>'","linkify":"Method '\\<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '\\<delegatename>'","nodes":[{"content":"Method '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>methodname&gt;' does not have the same signature as delegate '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>delegatename&gt;'","pos":[0,85],"source":"Method '\\<methodname>' does not have the same signature as delegate '\\<delegatename>'"}]},{"content":"There is a mismatch between the signatures of the method and delegate you are attempting to use.","pos":[337,433]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Delegate`</ph> statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class.","pos":[434,524],"source":" The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class."},{"content":"Any procedure with matching parameters, types, and return type may be used to create an instance of this delegate type.","pos":[525,644]},{"content":"Each delegate class defines a constructor that is passed the specification of an object method.","pos":[645,740]},{"pos":[747,768],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30408","source":"**Error ID:** BC30408"},{"pos":[777,798],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check the signatures to find the mismatch, and correct it.","pos":[808,866]},{"pos":[875,883],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[887,979],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Delegate Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)"}]}
