For example, `\\b` is an anchor that indicates that a regular expression match should begin on a word boundary, `\\t` represents a tab, and `\\x020` represents a space.  \n  \n-   A character that otherwise would be interpreted as an unescaped language construct should be interpreted literally. For example, a brace (`{`) begins the definition of a quantifier, but a backslash followed by a brace (`\\{`) indicates that the regular expression engine should match the brace. Similarly, a single backslash marks the beginning of an escaped language construct, but two backslashes (`\\\\`) indicate that the regular expression engine should match the backslash.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Character escapes are recognized in regular expression patterns but not in replacement patterns.  \n  \n## Character Escapes in .NET  \n The following table lists the character escapes supported by regular expressions in .NET.  \n  \n|Character or sequence|Description|  \n|---------------------------|-----------------|  \n|All characters except for the following:<br /><br /> . $ ^ { [ ( &#124; ) * + ? \\|Characters other than those listed in the **Character or sequence** column have no special meaning in regular expressions; they match themselves.<br /><br /> The characters included in the **Character or sequence** column are special regular expression language elements. To match them in a regular expression, they must be escaped or included in a [positive character group](../../../docs/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions.md). For example, the regular expression `\\$\\d+` or `[$]\\d+` matches \"$1200\".|  \n|`\\a`|Matches a bell (alarm) character, `\\u0007`.|  \n|`\\b`|In a `[`*character_group*`]` character class, matches a backspace, `\\u0008`.  (See [Character Classes](../../../docs/standard/base-types/character-classes-in-regular-expressions.md).) Outside a character class, `\\b` is an anchor that matches a word boundary. (See [Anchors](../../../docs/standard/base-types/anchors-in-regular-expressions.md).)|  \n|`\\t`|Matches a tab, `\\u0009`.|  \n|`\\r`|Matches a carriage return, `\\u000D`. Note that `\\r` is not equivalent to the newline character, `\\n`.|  \n|`\\v`|Matches a vertical tab, `\\u000B`.|  \n|`\\f`|Matches a form feed, `\\u000C`.|  \n|`\\n`|Matches a new line, `\\u000A`.|  \n|`\\e`|Matches an escape, `\\u001B`.|  \n|`\\` *nnn*|Matches an ASCII character, where *nnn* consists of two or three digits that represent the octal character code. For example, `\\040` represents a space character. This construct is interpreted as a backreference if it has only one digit (for example, `\\2`) or if it corresponds to the number of a capturing group. (See [Backreference Constructs](../../../docs/standard/base-types/backreference-constructs-in-regular-expressions.md).)|  \n|`\\x` *nn*|Matches an ASCII character, where *nn* is a two-digit hexadecimal character code.|  \n|`\\c` *X*|Matches an ASCII control character, where X is the letter of the control character. For example, `\\cC` is CTRL-C.|  \n|`\\u` *nnnn*|Matches a UTF-16 code unit whose value is *nnnn* hexadecimal. **Note:**  The Perl 5 character escape that is used to specify Unicode is not supported by .NET. The Perl 5 character escape has the form `\\x{`*####*`…}`, where *####*`…` is a series of hexadecimal digits. Instead, use `\\u`*nnnn*.|  \n|`\\`|When followed by a character that is not recognized as an escaped character, matches that character. For example, `\\*` matches an asterisk (*) and is the same as `\\x2A`.|  \n  \n## An Example  \n The following example illustrates the use of character escapes in a regular expression. It parses a string that contains the names of the world's largest cities and their populations in 2009. Each city name is separated from its population by a tab (`\\t`) or a vertical bar (&#124; or `\\u007c`). Individual cities and their populations are separated from each other by a carriage return and line feed.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RegularExpressions.Language.Escapes#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/regularexpressions.language.escapes/cs/escape1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[RegularExpressions.Language.Escapes#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/regularexpressions.language.escapes/vb/escape1.vb#1)]  \n  \n The regular expression `\\G(.+)[\\t|\\u007c](.+)\\r?\\n` is interpreted as shown in the following table.  \n  \n|Pattern|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|`\\G`|Begin the match where the last match ended.|  \n|`(.+)`|Match any character one or more times.
