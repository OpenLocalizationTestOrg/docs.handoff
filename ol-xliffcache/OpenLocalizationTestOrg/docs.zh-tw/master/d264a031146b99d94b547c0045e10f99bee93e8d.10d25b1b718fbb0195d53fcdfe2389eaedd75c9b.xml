docked and arranging of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls when you do not need the four panels and central panel of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripContainer>.  \n  \n The topics in this section describe the concepts and techniques that you can use to build `ToolStripPanel` features into your applications.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ToolStripPanel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/toolstrippanel-control-overview.md)  \n Provides topics that describe the purpose and main concepts of the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripContainer> control.  \n  \n [How to: Join ToolStripPanels](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-join-toolstrippanels.md)  \n Demonstrates adding <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls to a `ToolStripPanel`.  \n  \n [How to: Use ToolStripPanels for MDI](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-use-toolstrippanels-for-mdi.md)  \n Demonstrates the flexibility afforded by `ToolStripPanel` controls in a Multiple Document Interface application.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls to Use on Windows
