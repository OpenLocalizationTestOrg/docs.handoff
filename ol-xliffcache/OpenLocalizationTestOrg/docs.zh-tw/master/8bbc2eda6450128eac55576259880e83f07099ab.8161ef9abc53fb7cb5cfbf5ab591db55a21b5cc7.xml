The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as width and color, of the line used to render the ellipse. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method. The remaining arguments passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method specify the bounding rectangle for the ellipse. The following illustration shows an ellipse along with its bounding rectangle.  \n  \n ![Ellipses and arcs](./media/aboutgdip02-art05.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art05\")  \n  \n The following example draws an ellipse; the bounding rectangle has a width of 80, a height of 40, and an upper-left corner of (100, 50):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#51](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#51)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#51](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#51)]  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> is an overloaded method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, so there are several ways you can supply it with arguments. For example, you can construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> and pass the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method as an argument:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#52](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#52)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#52](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#52)]  \n  \n## Drawing an Arc  \n An arc is a portion of an ellipse. To draw an arc, you call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class. The parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> method are the same as the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method, except that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> requires a starting angle and sweep angle. The following example draws an arc with a starting angle of 30 degrees and a sweep angle of 180 degrees:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#53](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#53)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#53](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#53)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the arc, the ellipse, and the bounding rectangle.  \n  \n ![Ellipses and arcs](./media/aboutgdip02-art06.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art06\")  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Pen?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](lines-curves-and-shapes.md)\n- [How to: Create Graphics Objects for Drawing](how-to-create-graphics-objects-for-drawing.md)\n- [How to: Create a Pen](how-to-create-a-pen.md)\n- [How to: Draw an Outlined Shape](how-to-draw-an-outlined-shape.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,305],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"arcs\"\n  - \"GDI+, arcs\"\n  - \"drawing [Windows Forms], ellipses\"\n  - \"GDI+, ellipses\"\n  - \"ellipses\"\n  - \"drawing [Windows Forms], arcs\"\nms.assetid: 34f35133-a835-4ca4-81f6-0dfedee8b683","nodes":[{"content":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","nodes":[{"content":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[312,337],"content":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","linkify":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","nodes":[{"content":"Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[338,530],"content":"You can easily draw ellipses and arcs using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A&gt;</ph> methods of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","source":"You can easily draw ellipses and arcs using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"pos":[539,557],"content":"Drawing an Ellipse","linkify":"Drawing an Ellipse","nodes":[{"content":"Drawing an Ellipse","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"To draw an ellipse, you need a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object and a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[561,669],"source":"To draw an ellipse, you need a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object and a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object provides the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A&gt;</ph> method, and the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen&gt;</ph> object stores attributes, such as width and color, of the line used to render the ellipse.","pos":[670,903],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as width and color, of the line used to render the ellipse."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen&gt;</ph> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[904,1035],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method."},{"content":"The remaining arguments passed to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A&gt;</ph> method specify the bounding rectangle for the ellipse.","pos":[1036,1174],"source":" The remaining arguments passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method specify the bounding rectangle for the ellipse."},{"content":"The following illustration shows an ellipse along with its bounding rectangle.","pos":[1175,1253]},{"pos":[1260,1331],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Ellipses and arcs<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/aboutgdip02-art05.gif \"</bpt>Aboutgdip02_art05<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Ellipses and arcs](./media/aboutgdip02-art05.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art05\")"},{"content":"The following example draws an ellipse;
