In the following example, a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> is created for `myMainPanel`. Two buttons, `button1` and `button2`, are added to the panel, and their names registered. Several animations and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> are created. The storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method is used to start the animations.  \n  \n Because `button1`, `button2`, and `myMainPanel` all share the same name scope, any one of them can be used with the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method to start the animations.  \n  \n## Example
