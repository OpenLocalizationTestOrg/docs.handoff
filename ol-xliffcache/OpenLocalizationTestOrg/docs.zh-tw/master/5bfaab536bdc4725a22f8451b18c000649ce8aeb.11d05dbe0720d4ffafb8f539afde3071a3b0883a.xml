The sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which implements the `ICalculator` service contract. This sample explicitly defines service behaviors and operation behaviors using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attributes. You can configure behaviors in configuration files or imperatively in code (as this sample demonstrates).  \n  \n In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The service class specifies behaviors with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> as shown in the following code sample. All values specified are the defaults.  \n  \n```csharp\n[ServiceBehavior(  \n    AutomaticSessionShutdown=true,  \n    ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Single,  \n    InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerSession,  \n    IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults=false,  \n    UseSynchronizationContext=true,  \n    ValidateMustUnderstand=true)]  \npublic class CalculatorService : ICalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationBehavior(  \n        TransactionAutoComplete=true,  \n        TransactionScopeRequired=false,  \n        Impersonation=ImpersonationOption.NotAllowed)]  \n    public double Add(double n1, double n2)  \n    {  \n        System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1600);  \n        return n1 + n2;  \n    }  \n    ...  \n}  \n```  \n  \n Service behaviors are specified with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> attribute. The following table describes some of these behaviors.  \n  \n|Service behavior|Description|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.AutomaticSessionShutdown%2A>|Automatically shuts down a session at the client's request.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ConcurrencyMode%2A>|Specifies the concurrency mode for each service instance.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.InstanceContextMode%2A>|Specifies the instance context mode.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.UseSynchronizationContext%2A>|Determines whether to use the provided synchronization context, if one is set. Use this when you want to control whether to use a `WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext` in Windows Forms applications.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults%2A>|Determines whether general unhandled execution exceptions are to be converted into a `Fault<string>` and sent as a fault message.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionIsolationLevel%2A>|Specifies the isolation level for transactions.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.ValidateMustUnderstand%2A>|Determines whether unexpected message headers cause an error condition.|  \n  \n Operation behaviors are specified by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> attribute. The following table describes some of these behaviors.  \n  \n|Operation Behavior|Description|  \n|------------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionAutoComplete%2A>|Determines whether service operation completion commits the current transaction.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A>|Determines whether the service operation enlists in a client-flowed transaction.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.Impersonation%2A>|Determines whether the service operation impersonates the caller's identity.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.ReleaseInstanceMode%2A>|Determines whether service instances are recycled at the start or end of the service operation call.|  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. The delay between the calls is the result of the calls to `System.Threading.Thread.Sleep()` made in the service operations. The rest of the behavior samples explain these behaviors in more detail. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```console  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
