Some can manifest in unpredictable ways in an app.  The following example shows an access violation caused by referencing a null object:  \n  \n```  \n  \nAccess violation - code c0000005 (first chance)  \nApp!$3_App::Core::Util::NavigationArgs.Setup  \nApp!$3_App::Core::Util::NavigationArgs..ctor  \nApp!$0_App::Gibbon::Util::DesktopNavigationArgs..ctor  \nApp!$0_App::ViewModels::DesktopAppVM.NavigateToPage  \nApp!$3_App::Core::ViewModels::AppViewModel.NavigateToFirstPage  \nApp!$3_App::Core::ViewModels::AppViewModel::<HandleLaunch>d__a.MoveNext  \nApp!$43_System::Runtime::CompilerServices::AsyncMethodBuilderCore.CallMoveNext  \nApp!System::Action.InvokeClosedStaticThunk  \nApp!System::Action.Invoke  \nApp!$43_System::Threading::Tasks::AwaitTaskContinuation.InvokeAction  \nApp!$43_System::Threading::SendOrPostCallback.InvokeOpenStaticThunk  \n[snip]  \n  \n```  \n  \n Let's try to troubleshoot this exception by using the three-step approach outlined in the \"Manually resolve missing metadata\" section of [Getting Started](../../../docs/framework/net-native/getting-started-with-net-native.md).  \n  \n## What was the app doing?  \n The first thing to note is the `async` keyword machinery at the base of the stack.  Determining what the app was really doing in an `async` method can be problematic, because the stack has lost the context of the originating call and has run the `async` code on a different thread. However, we can deduce that the app is trying to load its first page.  In the implementation for `NavigationArgs.Setup`, the following code caused the access violation:  \n  \n```  \nAppViewModel.Current.LayoutVM.PageMap  \n```  \n  \n In this instance, the `LayoutVM` property on `AppViewModel.Current` was **null**.  Some absence of metadata caused a subtle behavior difference and resulted in a property being uninitialized instead of set, as the app expected.  Setting a breakpoint in the code where `LayoutVM` should have been initialized might throw light on the situation.  However, note that `LayoutVM`’s type is `App.Core.ViewModels.Layout.LayoutApplicationVM`.  The only metadata directive present so far in the rd.xml file is:  \n  \n```  \n  \n<Namespace Name=\"App.ViewModels\" Browse=\"Required Public\" Dynamic=\"Required Public\" />  \n  \n```  \n  \n A likely candidate for the failure is that `App.Core.ViewModels.Layout.LayoutApplicationVM` is missing metadata because it's in a different namespace.  \n  \n In this case, adding a runtime directive for `App.Core.ViewModels` resolved the issue. The root cause was an API call to the <xref:System.Type.GetType%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName> method that returned **null**, and the app silently ignored the problem until a crash occurred.  \n  \n In dynamic programming, a good practice when using reflection APIs under [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] is to use the <xref:System.Type.GetType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> overloads that throw an exception on failure.  \n  \n## Is this an isolated case?  \n Other issues might also arise when using `App.Core.ViewModels`.  You must decide whether it’s worth identifying and fixing each missing metadata exception, or saving time and adding directives for a larger class of types.  Here, adding `dynamic` metadata for `App.Core.ViewModels` might be the best approach if the resulting size increase of the output binary isn’t an issue.  \n  \n## Could the code be rewritten?  \n If the app had used `typeof(LayoutApplicationVM)` instead of `Type.GetType(\"LayoutApplicationVM\")`, the tool chain could have preserved `browse` metadata.  However, it still wouldn't have created `invoke` metadata, which would have led to a [MissingMetadataException](../../../docs/framework/net-native/missingmetadataexception-class-net-native.md) exception when instantiating the type. To prevent the exception, you'd still have to add a runtime directive for the namespace or the type that specifies the `dynamic` policy.
