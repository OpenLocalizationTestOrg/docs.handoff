The act of promoting a property causes the value to be available within a special view in the database. These promoted properties (properties that can be used in user queries) can be of simple types such as Int64, Guid, String, and DateTime or of a serialized binary type (byte[]).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SqlWorkflowInstanceStore> class has the <xref:System.Activities.DurableInstancing.SqlWorkflowInstanceStore.Promote%2A> method that you can use to promote a property as a property that can be used in queries. The following example is an end-to-end example of store extensibility.  \n  \n1.  In this example scenario, a document processing (DP) application has workflows, each of which uses custom activities for document processing. These workflows have a set of state variables that need to be made visible to the end user. To achieve this, the DP application provides an instance extension of type <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant>, which is used by activities to supply the state variables.  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    class DocumentStatusExtension : PersistenceParticipant  \n    {  \n        public string DocumentId;  \n        public string ApprovalStatus;  \n        public string UserName;  \n        public DateTime LastUpdateTime;  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  The new extension is then added to the host.  \n  \n    ```  \n    static Activity workflow = CreateWorkflow();  \n    WorkflowApplication application = new WorkflowApplication(workflow);  \n    DocumentStatusExtension documentStatusExtension = new DocumentStatusExtension ();  \n    application.Extensions.Add(documentStatusExtension);  \n    ```  \n  \n     For more details about adding a custom persistence participant, see the [Persistence Participants](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/persistence-participants.md) sample.  \n  \n3.  The custom activities in the DP application populate various status fields in the **Execute** method.  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    public override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)  \n    {  \n        // ...  \n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().DocumentId = Guid.NewGuid();  \n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().UserName = \"John Smith\";  \n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().ApprovalStatus = \"Approved\";  \n        context.GetExtension<DocumentStatusExtension>().LastUpdateTime = DateTime.Now();  \n        // ...  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  When a workflow instance reaches a persistence point, the **CollectValues** method of the **DocumentStatusExtension** persistence participant saves these properties into the persistence data collection.  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    class DocumentStatusExtension : PersistenceParticipant  \n    {  \n        const XNamespace xNS = XNamespace.Get(\"http://contoso.com/DocumentStatus\");  \n  \n        protected override void CollectValues(out IDictionary<XName, object> readWriteValues, out IDictionary<XName, object> writeOnlyValues)  \n        {  \n            readWriteValues = new Dictionary<XName, object>();  \n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"UserName\"), this.UserName);  \n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"ApprovalStatus\"), this.ApprovalStatus);  \n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"DocumentId\"), this.DocumentId);  \n            readWriteValues.Add(xNS.GetName(\"LastModifiedTime\"), this.LastUpdateTime);  \n  \n            writeOnlyValues = null;  \n        }  \n        // ...  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  All these properties are passed to **SqlWorkflowInstanceStore** by the persistence framework through the **SaveWorkflowCommand.InstanceData** collection.  \n  \n5.  The DP application initializes the SQL Workflow Instance Store and invokes the **Promote** method to promote this data.  \n  \n    ```  \n    SqlWorkflowInstanceStore store = new SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(connectionString);  \n  \n    List<XName> variantProperties = new List<XName>()   \n    {   \n        xNS.GetName(\"UserName\"),   \n        xNS.GetName(\"ApprovalStatus\"),   \n        xNS.GetName(\"DocumentId\"),   \n        xNS.GetName(\"LastModifiedTime\")   \n    };  \n  \n    store.Promote(\"DocumentStatus\", variantProperties, null);  \n    ```  \n  \n     Based on this promotion information, **SqlWorkflowInstanceStore** places the data properties in the columns of the [InstancePromotedProperties](#InstancePromotedProperties) view.\n  \n6.  To query a subset of the data from the promotion table, the DP application adds a customized view on top of the promotion view.  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    create view [dbo].[DocumentStatus] with schemabinding  \n    as  \n        select  P.[InstanceId] as [InstanceId],  \n            P.Value1 as [UserName],  \n            P.Value2 as [ApprovalStatus],  \n            P.Value3 as [DocumentId],  \n            P.Value4 as [LastUpdatedTime]  \n    from [System.Activities.DurableInstancing].[InstancePromotedProperties] as P  \n    where P.PromotionName = N'DocumentStatus'  \n    go  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n##  <a name=\"InstancePromotedProperties\"></a> [System.Activities.DurableInstancing.InstancePromotedProperties] view  \n  \n|Column Name|Column Type|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|InstanceId|GUID|The workflow instance that this promotion belongs to.|  \n|PromotionName|nvarchar(400)|The name of the promotion itself.|  \n|Value1, Value2, Value3,..,Value32|sql_variant|The value of the promoted property itself.
