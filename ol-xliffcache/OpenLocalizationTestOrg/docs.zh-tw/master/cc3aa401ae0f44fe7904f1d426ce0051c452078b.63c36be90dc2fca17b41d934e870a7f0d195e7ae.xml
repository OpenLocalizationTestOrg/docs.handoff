C# is a .NET language; therefore, distributing any C# executables to other machines requires the .NET Framework to be installed on each execution machine (and possibly other dependencies specific to your application). You have a variety of options available for distributing the .NET Framework. For an overview, see [Deployment Guide for Developers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee942965).  \n  \n Moving completed applications to other computers is generally referred to as deployment. The Microsoft development environment provides mechanisms for deployment; for more information, see [Deploying Applications and Components](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-applications-services-and-components).  \n  \n If you build and distribute mainly from the command line, you might need to consider other methods of deployment and redistributing dependencies.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Command-line Building With csc.exe](command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"Deployment of C# Applications | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Deployment of C# Applications | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[641,670],"content":"Deployment of C# Applications","linkify":"Deployment of C# Applications","nodes":[{"content":"Deployment of C# Applications","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"After you have completed building your C# application, the next step is to distribute it.","pos":[671,760]},{"content":"C# is a .NET language; therefore, distributing any C# executables to other machines requires the .NET Framework to be installed on each execution machine (and possibly other dependencies specific to your application).","pos":[761,978]},{"content":"You have a variety of options available for distributing the .NET Framework.","pos":[979,1055]},{"content":"For an overview, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Deployment Guide for Developers<ept id=\"p1\">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee942965)</ept>.","pos":[1056,1156],"source":" For an overview, see [Deployment Guide for Developers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee942965)."},{"content":"Moving completed applications to other computers is generally referred to as deployment.","pos":[1163,1251]},{"content":"The Microsoft development environment provides mechanisms for deployment; for more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Deploying Applications and Components<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-applications-services-and-components)</ept>.","pos":[1252,1491],"source":" The Microsoft development environment provides mechanisms for deployment; for more information, see [Deploying Applications and Components](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/deploying-applications-services-and-components)."},{"content":"If you build and distribute mainly from the command line, you might need to consider other methods of deployment and redistributing dependencies.","pos":[1498,1643]},{"pos":[1652,1660],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1664,1739],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Command-line Building With csc.exe<ept id=\"p1\">](command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)</ept>","source":"[Command-line Building With csc.exe](command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)"}]}
