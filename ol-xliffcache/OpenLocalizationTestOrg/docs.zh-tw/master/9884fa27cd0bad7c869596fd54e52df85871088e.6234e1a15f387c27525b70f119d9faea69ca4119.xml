When compiling C# code, you need to supply appropriate `using` directives.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code contains the `using` directives that the C# examples require to build and run. Not all `using` directives are required for every example.  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Diagnostics;  \nusing System.Collections;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Collections.Specialized;  \nusing System.Text;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Xml;  \nusing System.Xml.Linq;  \nusing System.Xml.Schema;  \nusing System.Xml.XPath;  \nusing System.Xml.Xsl;  \nusing System.IO;  \nusing System.Threading;  \nusing System.Reflection;  \nusing System.IO.Packaging;  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to XML Programming Overview (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,121],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: e5d18fa1-2704-48fe-a44b-1564f97c9e9c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[128,167],"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","linkify":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (C#)","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"The various snippets and examples in this documentation use classes and types from a variety of namespaces.","pos":[168,275]},{"content":"When compiling C# code, you need to supply appropriate <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directives.","pos":[276,350],"source":" When compiling C# code, you need to supply appropriate `using` directives."},{"pos":[359,366],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code contains the <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directives that the C# examples require to build and run.","pos":[370,467],"source":"The following code contains the `using` directives that the C# examples require to build and run."},{"content":"Not all <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directives are required for every example.","pos":[468,526],"source":" Not all `using` directives are required for every example."},{"pos":[969,977],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[981,1108],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ to XML Programming Overview (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ to XML Programming Overview (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)"}]}
