your Visual Basic application.  \n  \n## In this section  \n [Accessing Computer Resources](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/computer-resources.md)  \n Contains documentation on how to use the `My.Computer` object to access information about the computer on which an application runs and how to control the computer.  \n  \n [Logging Information from the Application](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/logging-information-from-the-application.md)  \n Contains documentation on how to log information from your application using the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects, and how to extend the application's logging capabilities.  \n  \n [Accessing User Data](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-user-data.md)  \n Contains documentation on tasks that you can accomplish using the `My.User` object.  \n  \n [Accessing Application Forms](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-application-forms.md)  \n Contains documentation on accessing an application's forms by using the `My.Forms` and `My.Application` objects.  \n  \n [Accessing Application Web Services](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/accessing-application-web-services.md)  \n Contains documentation on how to access the Web services referenced by the application using the `My.WebServices` object.  \n  \n [Accessing Application Settings](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/accessing-application-settings.md)  \n Contains documentation on accessing an application's settings using the `My.Settings` object.  \n  \n [Processing Drives, Directories, and Files](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/processing.md)  \n Contains documentation on how to access the file system using the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Language Features](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/index.md)   \n [Programming Concepts](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/index.md)   \n [Collections](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/collections.md)   \n [Developing Applications with Visual
