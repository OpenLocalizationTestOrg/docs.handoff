The `catch` block is a series of statements beginning with the keyword `catch`, followed by an exception type and an action to be taken.\n\nThe following code example uses a `try`/`catch` block to catch a possible exception. The `Main` method contains a `try` block with a @System.IO.StreamReader statement that opens a data file called `data.txt` and writes a string from the file. Following the `try` block is a `catch` block that catches any exception that results from the `try` block.\n\n [!code-cpp[CatchException#3](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/CatchException/CPP/catchexception2.cpp#3)]\n [!code-csharp[CatchException#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/CatchException/CS/catchexception2.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[CatchException#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/CatchException/VB/catchexception2.vb#3)]  \n\nThe common language runtime catches exceptions that are not caught by a catch block. Depending on how the runtime is configured, a debug dialog box appears, or the program stops executing and a dialog box with exception information appears, or an error is printed out to STDERR.\n\n> [!NOTE] \n> Almost any line of code can cause an exception, particularly exceptions that are thrown by the common language runtime itself, such as @System.OutOfMemoryException. Most applications don't have to deal with these exceptions, but you should be aware of this possibility when writing libraries to be used by others.
