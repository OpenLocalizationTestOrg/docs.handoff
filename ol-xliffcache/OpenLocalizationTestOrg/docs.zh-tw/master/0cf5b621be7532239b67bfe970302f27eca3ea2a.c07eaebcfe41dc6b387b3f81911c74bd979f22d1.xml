Because of security and other requirements for UWP apps, you can't use the full set of .NET Framework APIs to open and read files. For more information, see [.NET for UWP apps overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/apps/br230302(v=vs.140)). However, you may want to use .NET Framework APIs for other stream manipulation operations. To manipulate these streams, you can convert between a .NET Framework stream type such as <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream> or <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, and a Windows Runtime stream such as <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IInputStream>, <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IOutputStream>, or <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream>.\n\nThe <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions?displayProperty=nameWithType> class contains methods that make these conversions easy. However, underlying differences between .NET Framework and Windows Runtime streams affect the results of using these methods, as described in the following sections:\n\n## Convert from a Windows Runtime to a .NET Framework stream\nTo convert from a Windows Runtime stream to a .NET Framework stream, use one of the following <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods:\n\n- <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts a random-access stream in the Windows Runtime to a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps.\n  \n- <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStreamForWrite%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts an output stream in the Windows Runtime to a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps.\n  \n- <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStreamForRead%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts an input stream in the Windows Runtime to a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps.\n\nThe Windows Runtime offers stream types that support reading only, writing only, or reading and writing. These capabilities are maintained when you convert a Windows Runtime stream to a .NET Framework stream. Furthermore, if you convert a Windows Runtime stream to a .NET Framework stream and back, you get the original Windows Runtime instance back. \n\nItâ€™s best practice to use the conversion method that matches the capabilities of the Windows Runtime stream you want to convert. However, since <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream> is readable and writeable (it implements both <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IOutputStream> and <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IInputStream>), the conversion methods maintain the capabilities of the original stream. For example, using <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStreamForRead%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to convert an <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream> doesn't limit the converted .NET Framework stream to being readable. It's also writable.\n\n## Example: Convert Windows Runtime random-access to .NET Framework stream\nTo convert from a Windows Runtime random-access stream to a .NET Framework stream, use the <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.\n\nThe following code example prompts you to select a file, opens it with Windows Runtime APIs, and then converts it to a .NET Framework stream. It reads the stream and outputs it to a text block. You would typically manipulate the stream with .NET Framework APIs before outputting the results.\n\nTo run this example, create a UWP XAML app that contains a text block named `TextBlock1` and a button named  `Button1`. Associate the button click event with the `button1_Click` method shown in the example.\n\n  [!code-csharp[System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensionsEx#Imports](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.io.windowsruntimestreamextensionsex/cs/mainpage1.xaml.cs)]\n  [!code-vb[System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensionsEx#Imports](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.io.windowsruntimestreamextensionsex/vb/mainpage1.xaml.vb)]\n\n## Convert from a .NET Framework to a Windows Runtime stream\nTo convert from a .NET Framework stream to a Windows Runtime stream, use one of the following <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions?displayProperty=nameWithType> methods:\n\n- <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsInputStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps to an input stream in the Windows Runtime.\n  \n- <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsOutputStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> converts a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps to an output stream in the Windows Runtime.\n  \n- [AsRandomAccessStream](../../../docs/standard/cross-platform/windowsruntimestreamextensions-asrandomaccessstream-method.md) converts a managed stream in .NET for UWP apps to a random-access stream that the Windows Runtime can use for reading or writing.\n\nWhen you convert a .NET Framework stream to a Windows Runtime stream, the capabilities of the converted stream depend on the original stream. For example, if the original stream supports both reading and writing, and you call <xref:System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensions.AsInputStream%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to convert the stream, the returned type is an `IRandomAccessStream`. `IRandomAccessStream` implements `IInputStream` and `IOutputStream`, and supports reading and writing.\n\n.NET Framework streams don't support cloning, even after conversion. If you convert a .NET Framework stream to a Windows Runtime stream and call <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.InMemoryRandomAccessStream.GetInputStreamAt%2A> or <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.IRandomAccessStream.GetOutputStreamAt%2A>, which call <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.RandomAccessStreamOverStream.CloneStream%2A>, or if you call <xref:Windows.Storage.Streams.RandomAccessStreamOverStream.CloneStream%2A> directly, an exception occurs.\n\n## Example: Convert .NET Framework to Windows Runtime random-access stream\n\nTo convert from a .NET Framework stream to a Windows Runtime random-access stream, use the [AsRandomAccessStream](../../../docs/standard/cross-platform/windowsruntimestreamextensions-asrandomaccessstream-method.md) method, as shown in the following example:\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Make sure that the .NET Framework stream you are using supports seeking, or copy it to a stream that does. You can use the <xref:System.IO.Stream.CanSeek%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to determine this.\n\nTo run this example, create a UWP XAML app that targets the .NET Framework 4.5.1 and contains a text block named `TextBlock2` and a button named `Button2`. Associate the button click event with the `button2_Click` method shown in the example.\n\n  [!code-csharp[System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensionsEx#Imports](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.io.windowsruntimestreamextensionsex/cs/mainpage2.xaml.cs)]\n  [!code-vb[System.IO.WindowsRuntimeStreamExtensionsEx#Imports](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.io.windowsruntimestreamextensionsex/vb/mainpage2.xaml.vb)]\n\n## See
