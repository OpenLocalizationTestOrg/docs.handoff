The example table has four columns (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableColumn> elements) and several rows (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRow> elements) containing data as well as title, header, and footer information.  Rows must be contained in a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRowGroup> element.  Each row in the table is comprised of one or more cells (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableCell> elements).  Content in a table cell must be contained in a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Block> element; in this case <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Paragraph> elements are used.  The table also hosts a hyperlink (represented by the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink> element) in the footer row.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[TableSnippetsXAML#_TableXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TableSnippetsXAML/CS/Window1.xaml#_tablexaml)]  \n  \n The following figure shows how the table defined in this example renders:  \n  \n ![Screenshot of a table defined with XAML.](./media/how-to-define-a-table-with-xaml/planetary-information-xaml-table.png)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,260],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Define a Table with XAML\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"XAML [WPF], defining tables\"\n  - \"documents [WPF], defining tables with XAML\"\n  - \"tables [WPF], defining with XAML\"\nms.assetid: 83f2dc58-437e-4cdc-b5dd-0019810c7a85","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[267,299],"content":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","linkify":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Table with XAML","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The following example demonstrates how to define a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table&gt;</ph> using <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[300,465],"source":"The following example demonstrates how to define a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table> using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]."},{"content":"The example table has four columns (represented by <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableColumn&gt;</ph> elements) and several rows (represented by <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRow&gt;</ph> elements) containing data as well as title, header, and footer information.","pos":[467,721],"source":"  The example table has four columns (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableColumn> elements) and several rows (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRow> elements) containing data as well as title, header, and footer information."},{"content":"Rows must be contained in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRowGroup&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[723,805],"source":"  Rows must be contained in a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableRowGroup> element."},{"content":"Each row in the table is comprised of one or more cells (represented by <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableCell&gt;</ph> elements).","pos":[807,931],"source":"  Each row in the table is comprised of one or more cells (represented by <xref:System.Windows.Documents.TableCell> elements)."},{"content":"Content in a table cell must be contained in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.Block&gt;</ph> element; in this case <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.Paragraph&gt;</ph> elements are used.","pos":[933,1100],"source":"  Content in a table cell must be contained in a <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Block> element; in this case <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Paragraph> elements are used."},{"content":"The table also hosts a hyperlink (represented by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink&gt;</ph> element) in the footer row.","pos":[1102,1224],"source":"  The table also hosts a hyperlink (represented by the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink> element) in the footer row."},{"pos":[1233,1240],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following figure shows how the table defined in this example renders:","pos":[1381,1454]},{"content":"Screenshot of a table defined with XAML.","pos":[1463,1503]}]}
