The following sections show some simple ways to supply parameters and return values from procedures on separate threads.  \n  \n## Supplying Parameters for Multithreaded Procedures  \n The best way to supply parameters for a multithreaded method call is to wrap the target method in a class and define fields for that class that will serve as parameters for the new thread. The advantage of this approach is that you can create a new instance of the class, with its own parameters, every time you want to start a new thread. For example, suppose you have a function that calculates the area of a triangle, as in the following code:  \n  \n```vb  \nFunction CalcArea(ByVal Base As Double, ByVal Height As Double) As Double  \n    CalcArea = 0.5 * Base * Height  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n You can write a class that wraps the `CalcArea` function and creates fields to store input parameters, as follows:  \n  \n```vb  \nClass AreaClass  \n    Public Base As Double  \n    Public Height As Double  \n    Public Area As Double  \n    Sub CalcArea()  \n        Area = 0.5 * Base * Height  \n        MessageBox.Show(\"The area is: \" & Area.ToString)  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n To use the `AreaClass`, you can create an `AreaClass` object, and set the `Base` and `Height` properties as shown in the following code:  \n  \n```vb  \nProtected Sub TestArea()  \n    Dim AreaObject As New AreaClass  \n    Dim Thread As New System.Threading.Thread(  \n                        AddressOf AreaObject.CalcArea)  \n    AreaObject.Base = 30  \n    AreaObject.Height = 40  \n    Thread.Start()  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n Notice that the `TestArea` procedure does not check the value of the `Area` field after calling the `CalcArea` method. Because `CalcArea` runs on a separate thread, the `Area` field is not guaranteed to be set if you check it immediately after calling `Thread.Start`. The next section discusses a better way to return values from multithreaded procedures.  \n  \n## Returning Values from Multithreaded Procedures  \n Returning values from procedures that run on separate threads is complicated by the fact that the procedures cannot be functions and cannot use `ByRef` arguments. The easiest way to return values is to use the <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker> component to manage your threads and raise an event when the task is done, and process the results with an event handler.  \n  \n The following example returns a value by raising an event from a procedure running on a separate thread:  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate Class AreaClass2  \n    Public Base As Double  \n    Public Height As Double  \n    Function CalcArea() As Double  \n        ' Calculate the area of a triangle.  \n        Return 0.5 * Base * Height  \n    End Function  \nEnd Class  \n  \nPrivate WithEvents BackgroundWorker1 As New System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker  \n  \nPrivate Sub TestArea2()  \n    Dim AreaObject2 As New AreaClass2  \n    AreaObject2.Base = 30  \n    AreaObject2.Height = 40  \n  \n    ' Start the asynchronous operation.  \n    BackgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync(AreaObject2)  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n' This method runs on the background thread when it starts.  \nPrivate Sub BackgroundWorker1_DoWork(  \n    ByVal sender As Object,   \n    ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs  \n    ) Handles BackgroundWorker1.DoWork  \n  \n    Dim AreaObject2 As AreaClass2 = CType(e.Argument, AreaClass2)  \n    ' Return the value through the Result property.  \n    e.Result = AreaObject2.CalcArea()  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n' This method runs on the main thread when the background thread finishes.  \nPrivate Sub BackgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted(  \n    ByVal sender As Object,  \n    ByVal e As System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs  \n    ) Handles BackgroundWorker1.RunWorkerCompleted  \n  \n    ' Access the result through the Result property.  \n    Dim Area As Double = CDbl(e.Result)  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"The area is: \" & Area.ToString)  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n You can provide parameters and return values to thread-pool threads by using the optional `ByVal` state-object variable of the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%2A> method. Thread-timer threads also support a state object for this purpose.
