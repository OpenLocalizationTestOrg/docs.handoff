You can assign a value only to a writable variable, property, or array element at run time. The following example illustrates how this error can occur.  \n  \n```  \nDim yesterday As Integer  \nReadOnly maximum As Integer = 45  \nyesterday + 1 = DatePart(DateInterval.Day, Now)  \n' The preceding line is an ERROR because of an expression on the left.  \nmaximum = 50  \n' The preceding line is an ERROR because maximum is declared ReadOnly.  \n```  \n  \n Similar examples could apply to properties and array elements.  \n  \n **Indirect Access.** Indirect access through a value type can also generate this error. Consider the following code example, which attempts to set the value of <xref:System.Drawing.Point> by accessing it indirectly through <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>.  \n  \n```  \n' Assume this code runs inside Form1.  \nDim exitButton As New System.Windows.Forms.Button()  \nexitButton.Text = \"Exit this form\"  \nexitButton.Location.X = 140  \n' The preceding line is an ERROR because of no storage for Location.  \n```  \n  \n The last statement of the preceding example fails because it creates only a temporary allocation for the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure returned by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property. A structure is a value type, and the temporary structure is not retained after the statement runs. The problem is resolved by declaring and using a variable for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>, which creates a more permanent allocation for the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure. The following example shows code that can replace the last statement of the preceding example.  \n  \n```  \nDim exitLocation as New System.Drawing.Point(140, exitButton.Location.Y)  \nexitButton.Location = exitLocation  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30068  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the statement assigns a value to an expression, replace the expression with a single writable variable, property, or array element.  \n  \n-   If the statement makes indirect access through a value type (usually a structure), create a variable to hold the value type.  \n  \n-   Assign the appropriate structure (or other value type) to the variable.  \n  \n-   Use the variable to access the property to assign it a value.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Operators and
