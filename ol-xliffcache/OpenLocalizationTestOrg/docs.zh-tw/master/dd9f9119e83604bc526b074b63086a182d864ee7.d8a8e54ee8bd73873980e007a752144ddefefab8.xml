This example uses three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition> objects and three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition> objects to create a grid that has nine cells, such as in a worksheet. Each cell contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element that represents data, and the top row contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> property applied. To show the boundaries of each cell, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ShowGridLines%2A> property is enabled.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/CSharp/Grid_Code.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/VisualBasic/grid_vb.vb#3)]\n [!code-xml[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/XAML/default.xaml#3)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>   \n [Panels Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"How to: Create a Grid Element | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Grid Element | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[432,461],"content":"How to: Create a Grid Element","linkify":"How to: Create a Grid Element","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Grid Element","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[465,472],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to create and use an instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> by using either <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> or code.","pos":[476,671],"source":"The following example shows how to create and use an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> by using either [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] or code."},{"content":"This example uses three <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition&gt;</ph> objects and three <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition&gt;</ph> objects to create a grid that has nine cells, such as in a worksheet.","pos":[672,876],"source":" This example uses three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition> objects and three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RowDefinition> objects to create a grid that has nine cells, such as in a worksheet."},{"content":"Each cell contains a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> element that represents data, and the top row contains a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> with the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A&gt;</ph> property applied.","pos":[877,1113],"source":" Each cell contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element that represents data, and the top row contains a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> property applied."},{"content":"To show the boundaries of each cell, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ShowGridLines%2A&gt;</ph> property is enabled.","pos":[1114,1228],"source":" To show the boundaries of each cell, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ShowGridLines%2A> property is enabled."},{"pos":[1235,1542],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Grid#3<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/CSharp/Grid_Code.cs#3)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept> <bpt id=\"p3\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p4\">[</bpt>Grid#3<ept id=\"p4\">](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/VisualBasic/grid_vb.vb#3)</ept><ept id=\"p3\">]</ept> <bpt id=\"p5\">[!code-xml</bpt><bpt id=\"p6\">[</bpt>Grid#3<ept id=\"p6\">](../../../../samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/XAML/default.xaml#3)</ept><ept id=\"p5\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/CSharp/Grid_Code.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/VisualBasic/grid_vb.vb#3)]\n [!code-xml[Grid#3](../../../../samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Grid/XAML/default.xaml#3)]"},{"pos":[1551,1559],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph>","pos":[1563,1598],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Panels Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1602,1680],"source":" [Panels Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md)"}]}
