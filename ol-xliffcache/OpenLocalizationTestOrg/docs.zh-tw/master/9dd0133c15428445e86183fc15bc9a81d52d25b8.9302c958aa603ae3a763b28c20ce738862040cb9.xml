For more information, see [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30991  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Examine the class definition to determine which member is shared.  \n  \n2.  Eliminate the initialization for that member from the object initializer list.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, `totalCustomers` is a shared member.  \n  \n```  \nPublic Class Customer  \n    Public Shared totalCustomers As Integer  \n    ' Other declarations and method definitions.  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n Because `totalCustomers` is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error.  \n  \n```  \n' This declaration is not valid.  \n' Dim cust As New Customer With { .Name = \"Coho Winery\", _  \n'                                 .totalCustomers = 21 }  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)   \n [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)   \n [NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,143],"content":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Member &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>membername<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,131],"source":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[660,774],"content":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","linkify":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","nodes":[{"content":"Member &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>membername<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","pos":[0,114],"source":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared"}]},{"content":"Object initializers cannot be used to initialize any member of a class that is declared as shared.","pos":[775,873]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept>.","pos":[874,968],"source":" For more information, see [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)."},{"pos":[975,996],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30991","source":"**Error ID:** BC30991"},{"pos":[1005,1026],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Examine the class definition to determine which member is shared.","pos":[1036,1101]},{"content":"Eliminate the initialization for that member from the object initializer list.","pos":[1111,1189]},{"pos":[1198,1205],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1209,1271],"content":"In the following example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`totalCustomers`</ph> is a shared member.","source":"In the following example, `totalCustomers` is a shared member."},{"pos":[1426,1542],"content":"Because <ph id=\"ph1\">`totalCustomers`</ph> is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error.","source":"Because `totalCustomers` is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error."},{"pos":[1721,1729],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1733,1907],"source":"[Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1910,1979],"source":" [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d)</ept>","pos":[1982,2099],"source":" [NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d)"}]}
