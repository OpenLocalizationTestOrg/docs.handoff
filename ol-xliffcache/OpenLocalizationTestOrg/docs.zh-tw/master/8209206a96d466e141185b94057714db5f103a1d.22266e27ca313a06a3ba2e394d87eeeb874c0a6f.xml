This topic provides a script written in HTML/JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is present on a system.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more detailed information on installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n When the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the MSI adds \".NET CLR\" and the version number to the UserAgent string. The following example shows a script embedded in a simple HTML page. The script searches the UserAgent string to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, and displays a status message on the results of the search.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This script is designed for Internet Explorer. Other browsers may not include .NET CLR information in the UserAgent string.  \n  \n```  \n<HTML>  \n  <HEAD>  \n    <TITLE>Test for the .NET Framework 3.5</TITLE>  \n    <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />  \n    <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=\"JavaScript\">  \n    <!--  \n    var dotNETRuntimeVersion = \"3.5.0.0\";  \n  \n    function window::onload()  \n    {  \n      if (HasRuntimeVersion(dotNETRuntimeVersion))  \n      {  \n        result.innerText =   \n          \"This machine has the correct version of the .NET Framework 3.5.\"  \n      }   \n      else  \n      {  \n        result.innerText =   \n          \"This machine does not have the correct version of the .NET Framework 3.5.\" +  \n          \" The required version is v\" + dotNETRuntimeVersion + \".\";  \n      }  \n      result.innerText += \"\\n\\nThis machine's userAgent string is: \" +   \n        navigator.userAgent + \".\";  \n    }  \n  \n    //  \n    // Retrieve the version from the user agent string and   \n    // compare with the specified version.  \n    //  \n    function HasRuntimeVersion(versionToCheck)  \n    {  \n      var userAgentString =   \n        navigator.userAgent.match(/.NET CLR [0-9.]+/g);  \n  \n      if (userAgentString != null)  \n      {  \n        var i;  \n  \n        for (i = 0; i < userAgentString.length; ++i)  \n        {  \n          if (CompareVersions(GetVersion(versionToCheck),   \n            GetVersion(userAgentString[i])) <= 0)  \n            return true;  \n        }  \n      }  \n  \n      return false;  \n    }  \n  \n    //  \n    // Extract the numeric part of the version string.  \n    //  \n    function GetVersion(versionString)  \n    {  \n      var numericString =   \n        versionString.match(/([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)/i);  \n      return numericString.slice(1);  \n    }  \n  \n    //  \n    // Compare the 2 version strings by converting them to numeric format.  \n    //  \n    function CompareVersions(version1, version2)  \n    {  \n      for (i = 0; i < version1.length; ++i)  \n      {  \n        var number1 = new Number(version1[i]);  \n        var number2 = new Number(version2[i]);  \n  \n        if (number1 < number2)  \n          return -1;  \n  \n        if (number1 > number2)  \n          return 1;  \n      }  \n  \n      return 0;  \n    }  \n  \n    -->  \n    </SCRIPT>  \n  </HEAD>  \n  \n  <BODY>  \n    <div id=\"result\" />  \n  </BODY>  \n</HTML>  \n  \n```  \n  \n If the search for the \".NET CLR \" version is successful, the following type of status message appears:  \n  \n `This machine has the correct version of the .NET Framework 3.5.`  \n  \n `This machine's userAgent string is: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.590; .NET CLR 3.5.20726; MS-RTC LM 8).`  \n  \n Otherwise, the following type of status message appears:  \n  \n `This machine does not have the correct version of the .NET Framework 3.5.
