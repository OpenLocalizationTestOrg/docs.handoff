When you use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind your data source to a Windows Forms control, you can notify the control that your data source has changed by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method to notify a bound control about an update in the data source.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/CPP/form1.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetBindings/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>\n- [BindingSource Component](bindingsource-component.md)\n- [How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,506],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"data binding [Windows Forms], updating\"\n  - \"BindingSource component [Windows Forms], updating data binding\"\n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], BindingSource component\"\n  - \"data sources [Windows Forms], updating\"\n  - \"BindingSource component [Windows Forms], examples\"\nms.assetid: bd8bd9b2-af8a-4f11-a3d5-54eecbe2400b","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","nodes":[{"pos":[0,85],"content":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","pos":[0,85]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[513,598],"content":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","linkify":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource","pos":[0,85]}]},{"content":"When you use data-bound controls, you sometimes have to respond to changes in the data source when the data source does not raise list-changed events.","pos":[599,749]},{"content":"When you use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource&gt;</ph> component to bind your data source to a Windows Forms control, you can notify the control that your data source has changed by calling the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[750,1014],"source":" When you use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind your data source to a Windows Forms control, you can notify the control that your data source has changed by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method."},{"pos":[1023,1030],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1034,1211],"content":"The following code example demonstrates using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A&gt;</ph> method to notify a bound control about an update in the data source.","source":"The following code example demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetBindings%2A> method to notify a bound control about an update in the data source."},{"pos":[1759,1777],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1781,1803]},{"content":"References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.","pos":[1813,1890]},{"content":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md)</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Command-line Building With csc.exe<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1897,2251],"source":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)."},{"content":"You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.","pos":[2252,2340]},{"pos":[2349,2357],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2495,2548],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>BindingSource Component<ept id=\"p1\">](bindingsource-component.md)</ept>","source":"[BindingSource Component](bindingsource-component.md)"},{"pos":[2551,2649],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)"}]}
