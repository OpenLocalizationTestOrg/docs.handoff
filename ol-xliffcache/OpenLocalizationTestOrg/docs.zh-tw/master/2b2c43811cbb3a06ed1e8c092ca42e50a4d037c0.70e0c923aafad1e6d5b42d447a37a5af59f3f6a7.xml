For example, in a Windows Forms application, you might want to make a comparison to determine whether the current instance (`Me`) is the same as a particular instance, such as `Form2`.  \n  \n Visual Basic provides two operators to compare pointers. The [Is Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md) returns `True` if the objects are identical, and the [IsNot Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md) returns `True` if they are not.  \n  \n## Determining if Two Objects Are Identical  \n  \n#### To determine if two objects are identical  \n  \n1.  Set up a `Boolean` expression to test the two objects.  \n  \n2.  In your testing expression, use the `Is` operator with the two objects as operands.  \n  \n     `Is` returns `True` if the objects point to the same class instance.  \n  \n## Determining if Two Objects Are Not Identical  \n Sometimes you want to perform an action if the two objects are not identical, and it can be awkward to combine `Not` and `Is`, for example `If Not obj1 Is obj2`. In such a case you can use the `IsNot` operator.  \n  \n#### To determine if two objects are not identical  \n  \n1.  Set up a `Boolean` expression to test the two objects.  \n  \n2.  In your testing expression, use the `IsNot` operator with the two objects as operands.  \n  \n     `IsNot` returns `True` if the objects do not point to the same class instance.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example tests pairs of `Object` variables to see if they point to the same class instance.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrKeywords#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrKeywords/VB/class7.vb#14)]  \n  \n The preceding example displays the following output.  \n  \n `objA different from objB? True`  \n  \n `objA identical to objC? True`  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Object Data Type](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md)\n- [Object
