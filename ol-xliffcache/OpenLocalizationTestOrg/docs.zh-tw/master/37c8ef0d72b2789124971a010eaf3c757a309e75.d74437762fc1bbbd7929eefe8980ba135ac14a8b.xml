When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The CLR can recycle previously created `ICLRTask` instances to avoid the overhead of repeatedly creating new instances every time it needs a fresh task. The host enables this feature by calling `ICLRTask::Reset` instead of [ICLRTask::ExitTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-exittask-method.md) when it has completed a task. The following list summarizes the normal life cycle of an `ICLRTask` instance:  \n  \n1.  The runtime creates a new `ICLRTask` instance.  \n  \n2.  The runtime calls [IHostTaskManager::GetCurrentTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-getcurrenttask-method.md) to get a reference to the current host task.  \n  \n3.  The runtime calls [IHostTask::SetCLRTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-setclrtask-method.md) to associate the new instance with the host task.  \n  \n4.  The task executes and completes.  \n  \n5.  The host destroys the task by calling `ICLRTask::ExitTask`.  \n  \n `Reset` alters this scenario in two ways. In step 5 above, the host calls `Reset` to reset the task to a clean state, and then decouples the `ICLRTask` instance from its associated [IHostTask](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md) instance. If desired, the host can also cache the `IHostTask` instance for reuse. In step 1 above, the runtime pulls a recycled `ICLRTask` from the cache instead of creating a new instance.  \n  \n This approach works well when the host also has a pool of reusable worker tasks. When the host destroys one of its `IHostTask` instances, it destroys the corresponding `ICLRTask` by calling `ExitTask`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
