concepts behind using strings in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Introduction to Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/introduction-to-strings.md)  \n Lists topics that describe the basic concepts behind using strings in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Create Strings Using a StringBuilder in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/how-to-create-strings-using-a-stringbuilder.md)  \n Demonstrates how to efficiently create a long string from many smaller strings.  \n  \n [How to: Search Within a String](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/how-to-search-within-a-string.md)  \n Demonstrates how to determine the index of the first occurrence of a substring.  \n  \n [Converting Between Strings and Other Data Types in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/converting-between-strings-and-other-data-types.md)  \n Lists topics that describe how to convert strings into other data types.  \n  \n [Validating Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)  \n Lists topics that discuss how to validate strings.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Encrypting and Decrypting Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings.md)  \n Demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt strings by using the cryptographic service provider version of the Triple Data Encryption Standard algorithm.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Language
