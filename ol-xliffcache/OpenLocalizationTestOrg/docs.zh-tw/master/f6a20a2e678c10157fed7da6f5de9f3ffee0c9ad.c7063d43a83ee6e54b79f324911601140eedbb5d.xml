An assembly provides the common language runtime with the information it needs to be aware of type implementations. It is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality. To the runtime, a type does not exist outside the context of an assembly.  \n  \n This section describes how to create modules, create assemblies from modules, create a key pair and sign an assembly with a strong name, and install an assembly into the global assembly cache. In addition, this section describes how to use the [MSIL Disassembler (Ildasm.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to view assembly manifest information.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, the runtime will not load an assembly that was compiled with a version of the .NET Framework that has a higher version number than the currently loaded runtime. This applies to the combination of the major and minor components of the version number.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Creating Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md)  \n Provides an overview of single-file and multifile assemblies.  \n  \n [Assembly Names](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-names.md)  \n Provides an overview of assembly naming.  \n  \n [How to: Determine an Assembly's Fully Qualified Name](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-determine-assembly-fully-qualified-name.md)  \n Describes how to determine the fully qualified name of an assembly.  \n  \n [Running Intranet Applications in Full Trust](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/running-intranet-applications-in-full-trust.md)  \n Describes how to specify legacy security policy for full-trust assemblies on an intranet share.  \n  \n [Assembly Location](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-location.md)  \n Provides an overview of where to locate assemblies.  \n  \n [How to: Build a Single-File Assembly](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-build-a-single-file-assembly.md)  \n Describes how to create a single-file assembly.  \n  \n [Multifile Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/multifile-assemblies.md)  \n Describes reasons for creating multifile assemblies.  \n  \n [How to: Build a Multifile Assembly](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-build-a-multifile-assembly.md)  \n Describes how to create a multifile assembly.  \n  \n [Setting Assembly Attributes](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/set-assembly-attributes.md)  \n Describes assembly attributes and how to set them.  \n  \n [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/create-and-use-strong-named-assemblies.md)  \n Describes how and why you sign an assembly with a strong name, and includes how-to topics.  \n  \n [Delay Signing an Assembly](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/delay-sign-assembly.md)  \n Describes how to delay-sign an assembly.  \n  \n [Working with Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/working-with-assemblies-and-the-gac.md)  \n Describes how and why you add assemblies to the global assembly cache, and includes how-to topics.  \n  \n [How to: View Assembly Contents](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-view-assembly-contents.md)  \n Describes how to use the MSIL Disassembler (Ildasm.exe) to view assembly contents.  \n  \n [Type Forwarding in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/type-forwarding-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)  \n Describes how to use type forwarding to move a type into a different assembly without breaking existing applications.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly>  \n The .NET Framework class that represents an assembly.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-obtain-type-and-member-information-from-an-assembly.md)  \n Describes how to programmatically obtain type and other information from an assembly.  \n  \n [Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)  \n Provides a conceptual overview of common language runtime assemblies.  \n  \n [Assembly Versioning](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md)  \n Provides an overview of assembly binding and of the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute> and <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute> attributes.  \n  \n [How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)  \n Describes how the runtime determines which assembly to use to fulfill a binding request.  \n  \n [Reflection](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Reflection** class to obtain information about an assembly.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,249],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Programming with Assemblies\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], programming\"\n  - \"programming assemblies\"\nms.assetid: 25918b15-701d-42c7-95fc-c290d08648d6\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"Programming with Assemblies","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"Programming with Assemblies","nodes":[{"content":"Programming with Assemblies","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[256,283],"content":"Programming with Assemblies","linkify":"Programming with Assemblies","nodes":[{"content":"Programming with Assemblies","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"Assemblies are the building blocks of the .NET Framework;
