However, it is more efficient to use XML literals, as shown in following code, because XML literals do not suffer from the same performance penalties as parsing XML from a string.  \n  \n By using XML literals, you can just copy and paste your XML into your Visual Basic program.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Parsing text or loading an XML document from a text file is less efficient than functional construction. If you are initializing an XML tree from code, it takes less processor time to use functional construction than to parse text.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim contacts as XElement = _  \n    <Contacts>  \n        <Contact>  \n            <Name>Patrick Hines</Name>  \n            <Phone Type=\"home\">206-555-0144</Phone>  \n            <Phone Type=\"work\">425-555-0145</Phone>  \n            <Address>  \n            <Street1>123 Main St</Street1>  \n            <City>Mercer Island</City>  \n            <State>WA</State>  \n            <Postal>68042</Postal>  \n            </Address>  \n            <NetWorth>10</NetWorth>  \n        </Contact>  \n        <Contact>  \n            <Name>Gretchen Rivas</Name>  \n            <Phone Type=\"mobile\">206-555-0163</Phone>  \n            <Address>  \n            <Street1>123 Main St</Street1>  \n            <City>Mercer Island</City>  \n            <State>WA</State>  \n            <Postal>68042</Postal>  \n            </Address>  \n            <NetWorth>11</NetWorth>  \n        </Contact>  \n    </Contacts>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Parsing XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/parsing-xml.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,119],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 896e1b4b-f9bd-4975-8bc1-55b6badce1ac","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[126,163],"content":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"This topic shows how to create an XML tree in C#.","pos":[164,213]},{"pos":[222,229],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"You can parse a string in Visual Basic by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`XElement.Parse`</ph> method.","pos":[233,309],"source":"You can parse a string in Visual Basic by using the `XElement.Parse` method."},{"content":"However, it is more efficient to use XML literals, as shown in following code, because XML literals do not suffer from the same performance penalties as parsing XML from a string.","pos":[310,489]},{"content":"By using XML literals, you can just copy and paste your XML into your Visual Basic program.","pos":[496,587]},{"pos":[595,837],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Parsing text or loading an XML document from a text file is less efficient than functional construction.
