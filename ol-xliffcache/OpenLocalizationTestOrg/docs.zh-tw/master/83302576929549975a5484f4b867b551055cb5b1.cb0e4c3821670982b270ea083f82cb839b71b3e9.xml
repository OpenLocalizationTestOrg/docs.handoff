For example, if you define a class or structure that you use as the counter variable in a [For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md), [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] requires both the `>=` and `<=` operators (as well as the `+` operator).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33033  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Define the matching operator in the same class or structure.
