This contract specifies the collection and structure of messages required to access the operations the service offers. This interface defines the input and output types by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> class to the interface and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to the methods that you want to expose.  \n  \n For more information about service contracts, see [Designing Service Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-service-contracts.md).  \n  \n### Creating a WCF contract with an interface  \n  \n1.  Create a new interface using Visual Basic, C#, or any other common language runtime language.  \n  \n2.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> class to the interface.  \n  \n3.  Define the methods in the interface.  \n  \n4.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each method that must be exposed as part of the public WCF contract.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows an interface that defines a service contract.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithInterface#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithinterface/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithInterface#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithinterface/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n The methods that have the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class applied use a request-reply message pattern by default. For more information about this message pattern, see [How to: Create a Request-Reply Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-request-reply-contract.md). You can also create and use other message patterns by setting properties of the attribute. For more examples, see [How to: Create a One-Way Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-one-way-contract.md) and [How to: Create a Duplex Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-duplex-contract.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,168],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Service with a Contract Interface\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
