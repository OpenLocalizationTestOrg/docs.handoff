Add the Obsolete attribute to 'member1'  \n  \n The compiler found an `override` to a method marked as `obsolete`. However, the overriding method was not itself marked as obsolete. The overriding method will still generate [CS0612](../../csharp/misc/cs0612.md), if called.  \n  \n Review your method declarations and explicitly indicate whether a method (and all of its overrides) should be marked `obsolete`.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0672:  \n  \n```  \n// CS0672.cs  \n// compile with: /W:1  \nclass MyClass  \n{  \n   [System.Obsolete]  \n   public virtual void ObsoleteMethod()  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n  \nclass MyClass2 : MyClass  \n{  \n   public override void ObsoleteMethod()   // CS0672  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n  \nclass MainClass  \n{  \n   static public void Main()  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[577,610],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS0672","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Member 'member1' overrides obsolete member 'member2.","pos":[611,663]},{"content":"Add the Obsolete attribute to 'member1'","pos":[664,703]},{"content":"The compiler found an <ph id=\"ph1\">`override`</ph> to a method marked as <ph id=\"ph2\">`obsolete`</ph>.","pos":[710,776],"source":"The compiler found an `override` to a method marked as `obsolete`."},{"content":"However, the overriding method was not itself marked as obsolete.","pos":[777,842]},{"content":"The overriding method will still generate <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>CS0612<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/misc/cs0612.md)</ept>, if called.","pos":[843,934],"source":" The overriding method will still generate [CS0612](../../csharp/misc/cs0612.md), if called."},{"pos":[941,1069],"content":"Review your method declarations and explicitly indicate whether a method (and all of its overrides) should be marked <ph id=\"ph1\">`obsolete`</ph>.","source":"Review your method declarations and explicitly indicate whether a method (and all of its overrides) should be marked `obsolete`."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0672:","pos":[1076,1114]}]}
