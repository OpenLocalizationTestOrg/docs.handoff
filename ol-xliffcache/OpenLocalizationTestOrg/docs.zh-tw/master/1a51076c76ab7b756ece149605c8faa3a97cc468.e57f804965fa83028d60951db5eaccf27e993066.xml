This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzProgressAssemblyName`.  \n  \n `pwzErrorAssemblyName`  \n  \n [out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied error user interface.  \n  \n `pwzErrorClassName`  \n  \n [out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element. This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzErrorAssemblyName`.  \n  \n## Property Value/Return Value  \n HRESULT: Ignored.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A host application may have a specific theme that PresentationHost.exe’s default user interfaces may not conform to. If this is the case, the host application can implement [GetCustomUI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md) to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe. PresentationHost.exe will always call [GetCustomUI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md) before using its default user interfaces.  \n  \n This function is called once during PresentationHost’s initialization.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IWpfHostSupport](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/iwpfhostsupport.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,40],"content":"GetCustomUI | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"GetCustomUI | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,28]}]},{"pos":[428,439],"content":"GetCustomUI","linkify":"GetCustomUI","nodes":[{"content":"GetCustomUI","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Called by PresentationHost.exe to get custom progress and error messages from the host, if implemented.","pos":[440,543]},{"pos":[552,558],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[745,755],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied progress user interface.","pos":[791,879]},{"content":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied progress user interface, preferably a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)]</ph> file with <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is its top-level element.","pos":[915,1158],"source":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied progress user interface, preferably a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element."},{"content":"This class resides in the assembly that is specified by <ph id=\"ph1\">`pwzProgressAssemblyName`</ph>.","pos":[1159,1241],"source":" This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzProgressAssemblyName`."},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied error user interface.","pos":[1277,1362]},{"content":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is its top-level element.","pos":[1395,1560],"source":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element."},{"content":"This class resides in the assembly that is specified by <ph id=\"ph1\">`pwzErrorAssemblyName`</ph>.","pos":[1561,1640],"source":" This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzErrorAssemblyName`."},{"pos":[1649,1676],"content":"Property Value/Return Value","linkify":"Property Value/Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Property Value/Return Value","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"HRESULT: Ignored.","pos":[1680,1697]},{"pos":[1706,1713],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"A host application may have a specific theme that PresentationHost.exe’s default user interfaces may not conform to.","pos":[1717,1833]},{"content":"If this is the case, the host application can implement <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetCustomUI<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md)</ept> to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe.","pos":[1834,2036],"source":" If this is the case, the host application can implement [GetCustomUI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md) to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe."},{"content":"PresentationHost.exe will always call <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetCustomUI<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md)</ept> before using its default user interfaces.","pos":[2037,2193],"source":" PresentationHost.exe will always call [GetCustomUI](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/getcustomui.md) before using its default user interfaces."},{"content":"This function is called once during PresentationHost’s initialization.","pos":[2200,2270]},{"pos":[2279,2287],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2291,2375],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>IWpfHostSupport<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/iwpfhostsupport.md)</ept>","source":"[IWpfHostSupport](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/iwpfhostsupport.md)"}]}
