The .svc file contains the name of the service and an optional custom service host factory. This additional file adds manageability overhead. The configuration-based activation feature removes the requirement to have a .svc file and therefore the associated overhead.\n\n## Configuration-Based Activation\n\nConfiguration-based activation takes the metadata that used to be placed in the .svc file and places it in the Web.config file. Within the<`serviceHostingEnvironment`> element there is a <`serviceActivations`> element. Within the <`serviceActivations`> element are one or more <`add`> elements, one for each hosted service. The <`add`> element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory. The following configuration example code shows how this section is used.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>  Each <`add`> element must specify a service or a factory attribute. Specifying both service and factory attributes is allowed.\n\n```xml\n<serviceHostingEnvironment>\n  <serviceActivations>\n    <add relativeAddress=\"MyServiceAddress\" service=\"Service\" factory=\"MyServiceHostFactory\"/>\n  </serviceActivations>\n</serviceHostingEnvironment>\n```\n\n With this in the Web.config file, you can place the service source code in the App_Code directory of the application or a complied assembly in the Bin directory of the application.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> - When using configuration-based activation, inline code in .svc files is not supported.\n> - The `relativeAddress` attribute must be set to a relative address such as \"\\<sub-directory>/service.svc\" or \"~/\\<sub-directory/service.svc\".\n> - A configuration exception is thrown if you register a relative address that does not have a known extension associated with WCF.\n> - The relative address specified is relative to the root of the virtual application.\n> - Due to the hierarchical model of configuration, the registered relative addresses at machine and site level are inherited by virtual applications.\n> - Registrations in a configuration file take precedence over settings in a .svc, .xamlx, .xoml, or other file.\n> - Any ‘\\’ (backslashes) in a URI sent to IIS/WAS are automatically converted to a ‘/’ (forward slash). If a relative address is added that contains a ‘\\’ and you send IIS a URI that uses the relative address, the backslash is converted to a forward slash and IIS cannot match it to the relative address. IIS sends out trace information that indicates that there are no matches found.\n\n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ServiceHostingEnvironmentSection.ServiceActivations%2A>\n- [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)\n- [Hosting Workflow Services Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-workflow-services-overview.md)\n- [\\<serviceHostingEnvironment>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicehostingenvironment.md)\n- [Windows Server App Fabric Hosting Features](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201276)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,129],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 6a927e1f-b905-4ee5-ad0f-78265da38238","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[136,181],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","linkify":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"Normally when hosting a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service under Internet Information Services (IIS) or Windows Process Activation Service (WAS), you must provide a .svc file.","pos":[183,370]},{"content":"The .svc file contains the name of the service and an optional custom service host factory.","pos":[371,462]},{"content":"This additional file adds manageability overhead.","pos":[463,512]},{"content":"The configuration-based activation feature removes the requirement to have a .svc file and therefore the associated overhead.","pos":[513,638]},{"pos":[643,673],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation","linkify":"Configuration-Based Activation","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Configuration-based activation takes the metadata that used to be placed in the .svc file and places it in the Web.config file.","pos":[675,802]},{"content":"Within the&lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`serviceHostingEnvironment`</ph>&gt; element there is a &lt;<ph id=\"ph2\">`serviceActivations`</ph>&gt; element.","pos":[803,893],"source":" Within the<`serviceHostingEnvironment`> element there is a <`serviceActivations`> element."},{"content":"Within the &lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`serviceActivations`</ph>&gt; element are one or more &lt;<ph id=\"ph2\">`add`</ph>&gt; elements, one for each hosted service.","pos":[894,998],"source":" Within the <`serviceActivations`> element are one or more <`add`> elements, one for each hosted service."},{"content":"The &lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`add`</ph>&gt; element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory.","pos":[999,1140],"source":" The <`add`> element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory."},{"content":"The following configuration example code shows how this section is used.","pos":[1141,1213]},{"pos":[1217,1354],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Each <`add`> element must specify a service or a factory attribute.
