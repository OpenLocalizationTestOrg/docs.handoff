Only attributes with a specific name are returned in the collection.  \n  \n The XPath expression is:  \n  \n `../Book/@id`  \n  \n## Example  \n This example first finds a `Book` element, and then finds all sibling elements named `Book`, and then finds all attributes named `id`. The result is a collection of attributes.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md).  \n  \n```vb  \nDim books as XDocument = XDocument.Load(\"Books.xml\")  \nDim book As XElement = books.Root.<Book>(0)  \n  \n' LINQ to XML query  \nDim list1 As IEnumerable(Of XAttribute) = _  \n    From el In book.Parent.<Book> _  \n    Select el.Attribute(\"id\")  \n  \n' XPath expression  \nDim list2 As IEnumerable(Of XAttribute) = DirectCast(book. _  \n    XPathEvaluate(\"../Book/@id\"), IEnumerable).Cast(Of XAttribute)()  \n  \nIf list1.Count() = list2.Count() And _  \n        (list1.Intersect(list2)).Count() = list1.Count() Then  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results are identical\")  \nElse  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results differ\")  \nEnd If  \n  \nFor Each el As XAttribute In list1  \n    Console.WriteLine(el)  \nNext  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nResults are identical  \nid=\"bk101\"  \nid=\"bk102\"  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,173],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 83b3ddca-830a-4b71-9756-9e4bdf907302","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,91],"content":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,91]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[180,271],"content":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find Attributes of Siblings with a Specific Name (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,91]}]},{"content":"This topic shows how to find all attributes of the siblings of the context node.","pos":[272,352]},{"content":"Only attributes with a specific name are returned in the collection.","pos":[353,421]},{"content":"The XPath expression is:","pos":[428,452]},{"pos":[481,488],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This example first finds a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Book`</ph> element, and then finds all sibling elements named <ph id=\"ph2\">`Book`</ph>, and then finds all attributes named <ph id=\"ph3\">`id`</ph>.","pos":[492,626],"source":"This example first finds a `Book` element, and then finds all sibling elements named `Book`, and then finds all attributes named `id`."},{"content":"The result is a collection of attributes.","pos":[627,668]},{"pos":[675,855],"content":"This example uses the following XML document: <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>.","source":"This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)."},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[1569,1612]},{"pos":[1686,1694],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1698,1831],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)"}]}
