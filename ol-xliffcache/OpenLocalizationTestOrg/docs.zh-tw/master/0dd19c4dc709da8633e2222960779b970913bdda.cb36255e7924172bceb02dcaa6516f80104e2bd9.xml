You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripLabel> with other new controls such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripDropDown>. However, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  \n  \n Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> controls are used to display text or images that cannot be edited by the user. They are used to identify objects on a form—to provide a description of what a certain control will do if clicked, for example, or to display information in response to a run-time event or process in your application. Because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control cannot receive focus, it can also be used to create access keys for other controls.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Label Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)  \n Describes how to use a label to define an access key for another control.  \n  \n [How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-size-a-windows-forms-label-control-to-fit-its-contents.md)  \n Explains adjusting the size of a label control for its caption.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[506,535],"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[538,962],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripLabel> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control.
