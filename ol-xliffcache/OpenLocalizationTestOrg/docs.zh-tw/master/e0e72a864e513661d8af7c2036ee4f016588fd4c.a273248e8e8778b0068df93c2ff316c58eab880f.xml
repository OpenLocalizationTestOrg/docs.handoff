This is only useful if you have many events, but you expect most of the events will not be implemented.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideEvents#9](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-a-dictionary-to-store-event-instances_1.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)   \n [Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,101],"content":"How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,89]}]},{"pos":[604,676],"content":"How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Dictionary to Store Event Instances (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,72]}]},{"content":"One use for <ph id=\"ph1\">`accessor-declarations`</ph> is to expose many events without allocating a field for each event, but instead using a Dictionary to store the event instances.","pos":[677,841],"source":"One use for `accessor-declarations` is to expose many events without allocating a field for each event, but instead using a Dictionary to store the event instances."},{"content":"This is only useful if you have many events, but you expect most of the events will not be implemented.","pos":[842,945]},{"pos":[954,961],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[965,1111],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csProgGuideEvents#9<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-a-dictionary-to-store-event-instances_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csProgGuideEvents#9](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-a-dictionary-to-store-event-instances_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[1120,1128],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1132,1199],"source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1202,1263],"source":" [Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Delegates<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1266,1332],"source":" [Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md)"}]}
