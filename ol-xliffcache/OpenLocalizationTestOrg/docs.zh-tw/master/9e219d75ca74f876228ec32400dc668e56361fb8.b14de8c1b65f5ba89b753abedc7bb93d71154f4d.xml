For the latest information about [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)], see [Windows Automation API: UI Automation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=156746).  \n  \n This topic shows how [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] can be used to expose objects embedded within the content of a text control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Embedded objects can include images, hyperlinks, buttons, tables, or ActiveX controls.  \n  \n Embedded objects are considered children of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] text provider. This allows them to be exposed through the same UI Automation tree structure as all other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] elements. Functionality, in turn, is exposed through the control patterns typically required by the embedded objects control type (for example, since hyperlinks are text-based they will support <xref:System.Windows.Automation.TextPattern>).  \n  \n ![Embedded objects in a text container.](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/media/uia-textpattern-embeddedobjects.PNG \"UIA_TextPattern_EmbeddedObjects\")  \nA sample document with textual content, (\"Did You Know?\"…) and two embedded objects (a picture of a whale and a text hyperlink), used as a target for the code examples.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to retrieve a collection of embedded objects from within a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] text provider. For the sample document provided in the introduction, two objects would be returned (an image element and a text element).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The image element should have some intrinsic text associated with it that describes the image, typically in its <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.NameProperty> (for example, \"A blue whale.\"). However, when a text range spanning the image object is obtained, neither the image nor this descriptive text is returned in the text stream.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FindText#StartApp](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/CSharp/SearchWindow.cs#startapp)]\n [!code-vb[FindText#StartApp](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/VisualBasic/SearchWindow.vb#startapp)]  \n[!code-csharp[FindText#FindTextProvider](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/CSharp/SearchWindow.cs#findtextprovider)]\n[!code-vb[FindText#FindTextProvider](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/VisualBasic/SearchWindow.vb#findtextprovider)]  \n[!code-csharp[FindText#GetChildren](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/CSharp/SearchWindow.cs#getchildren)]\n[!code-vb[FindText#GetChildren](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FindText/VisualBasic/SearchWindow.vb#getchildren)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to obtain a text range from an embedded object within a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] text provider.
