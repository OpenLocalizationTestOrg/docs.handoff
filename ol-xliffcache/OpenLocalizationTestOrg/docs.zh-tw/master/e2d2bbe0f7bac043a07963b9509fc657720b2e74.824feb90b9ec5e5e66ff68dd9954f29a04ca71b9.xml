[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] tries to convert these local methods to equivalent operations and functions that are available inside the SQL environment. Most methods and operators on [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] built-in types have direct translations to SQL commands. Some can be produced from the functions that are available. Those that cannot be produced generate run-time exceptions. For more information, see [SQL-CLR Type Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/sql-clr-type-mapping.md).  \n  \n In cases where a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] query is insufficient for a specialized task, you can use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.ExecuteQuery%2A> method to execute a SQL query, and then convert the result of your query directly into objects.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, assume that the data for the `Customer` class is spread over two tables (customer1 and customer2). The query returns a sequence of `Customer` objects.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqQuerying#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQuerying/cs/Program.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqQuerying#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQuerying/vb/Module1.vb#4)]  \n  \n As long as the column names in the tabular results match column properties of your entity class, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates your objects out of any SQL query.  \n  \n## Example  \n The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.ExecuteQuery%2A> method also allows for parameters. Use code such as the following to execute a parameterized query.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqQuerying#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQuerying/cs/Program.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqQuerying#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqQuerying/vb/Module1.vb#5)]  \n  \n The parameters are expressed in the query text by using the same curly notation used by `Console.WriteLine()` and `String.Format()`. In fact, `String.Format()` is actually called on the query string you provide, substituting the curly braced parameters with generated parameter names such as @p0, @p1 …, @p(n).  \n  \n## See Also  \n
