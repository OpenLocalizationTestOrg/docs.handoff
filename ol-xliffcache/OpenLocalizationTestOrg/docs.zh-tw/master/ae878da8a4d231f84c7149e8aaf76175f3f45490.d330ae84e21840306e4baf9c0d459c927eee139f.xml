The data source is a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> that contains the `Customers` and `Orders` tables from the Northwind SQL Server sample database along with a <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> that relates the two through the `CustomerID` column.  \n  \n One <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is bound to the parent `Customers` table in the data set. This data is displayed in the master <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. The other <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is bound to the first data connector. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataMember%2A> property of the second <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is set to the <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> name. This causes the associated detail <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to display the rows of the child `Orders` table that correspond to the current row in the master <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Creating a Master/Detail Form Using Two Windows Forms DataGridView Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/c5fa29e8-47f7-4691-829b-0e697a691f36.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/CS/masterdetails.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#00](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/VB/masterdetails.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n References to the System, System.Data, System.Windows.Forms, and System.XML assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\\(v=vs.110\\))  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database.
