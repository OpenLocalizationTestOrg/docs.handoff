This makes it easy to write programs quickly, but it can cause them to execute more slowly.  \n  \n## Strong Typing  \n Specifying data types for all your variables is known as *strong typing*. Using strong typing has several advantages:  \n  \n-   It enables IntelliSense support for your variables. This allows you to see their properties and other members as you type in the code.  \n  \n-   It takes advantage of compiler type checking. This catches statements that can fail at run time due to errors such as overflow. It also catches calls to methods on objects that do not support them.  \n  \n-   It results in faster execution of your code.  \n  \n## Most Efficient Data Types  \n For variables that never contain fractions, the integral data types are more efficient than the nonintegral types. In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], `Integer` and `UInteger` are the most efficient numeric types.  \n  \n For fractional numbers, `Double` is the most efficient data type, because the processors on current platforms perform floating-point operations in double precision. However, operations with `Double` are not as fast as with the integral types such as `Integer`.  \n  \n## Specifying Data Type  \n Use the [Dim Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md) to declare a variable of a specific type. You can simultaneously specify its access level by using the [Public](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/public.md), [Protected](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/protected.md), [Friend](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/friend.md), or [Private](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md) keyword, as in the following example.  \n  \n```  \nPrivate x As Double  \nProtected s As String  \n```  \n  \n## Character Conversion  \n The `AscW` and `ChrW` functions operate in Unicode. You should use them in preference to `Asc` and `Chr`, which must translate into and out of Unicode.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Strings.Asc%2A>   \n
