By default, the message body is formatted such that the parameters to a service operation are wrapped. The following sample shows an `Add` request message to the `ICalculator` service in wrapped mode.  \n  \n```xml  \n<s:Envelope   \n    xmlns:s=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"  \n    xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/08/addressing\">  \n    <s:Header>  \n        …  \n    </s:Header>  \n    <s:Body>  \n      <Add xmlns=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\">  \n        <n1>100</n1>  \n        <n2>15.99</n2>  \n      </Add>  \n    </s:Body>  \n</s:Envelope>  \n```  \n  \n The `<Add>` element in the message body wraps the `n1` and `n2` parameters. In contrast, the following sample shows the equivalent message in the unwrapped mode.  \n  \n```xml  \n<s:Envelope   \n    xmlns:s=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope\"   \n    xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/08/addressing\">  \n    <s:Header>  \n        ….  \n    </s:Header>  \n    <s:Body>  \n      <n1 xmlns=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\">100</n1>  \n      <n2 xmlns=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\">15.99</n2>  \n    </s:Body>  \n  </s:Envelope>  \n</MessageLogTraceRecord>  \n```  \n  \n The unwrapped message does not wrap the `n1` and `n2` parameters in a containing element, they are direct children of the soap body element.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n In this sample, an unwrapped message is created by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageContractAttribute> to the service operation parameter type and return value type as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```csharp\n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic interface ICalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ResponseMessage Add(RequestMessage request);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ResponseMessage Subtract(RequestMessage request);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ResponseMessage Multiply(RequestMessage request);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ResponseMessage Divide(RequestMessage request);  \n}  \n  \n//setting IsWrapped to false means the n1 and n2  \n//members will be direct children of the soap body element  \n[MessageContract(IsWrapped = false)]  \npublic class RequestMessage  \n{  \n    [MessageBodyMember]  \n    private double n1;  \n    [MessageBodyMember]  \n    private double n2;  \n    //…  \n}  \n  \n//setting IsWrapped to false means the result  \n//member will be a direct child of the soap body element  \n[MessageContract(IsWrapped = false)]  \npublic class ResponseMessage  \n{  \n    [MessageBodyMember]  \n    private double result;  \n    //…  \n}  \n```  \n  \n To allow you to see the messages being sent and received, this sample uses tracing. In addition, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> has been configured without security, to reduce the number of messages it logs.  \n  \n The resulting trace log (c:\\logs\\Message.log) can be viewed by using the [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md). To view message contents, select **Messages** in both the left and the right panes of the Service Trace Viewer tool. Trace logs in this sample are configured to be generated into the C:\\LOGS folder. Create this folder before running the sample and give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  Create a C:\\LOGS directory for logging messages. Give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.  \n  \n3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
