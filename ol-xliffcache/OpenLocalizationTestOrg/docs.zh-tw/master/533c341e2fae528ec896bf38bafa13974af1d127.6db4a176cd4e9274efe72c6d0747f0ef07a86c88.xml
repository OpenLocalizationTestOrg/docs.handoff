To draw a closed shape, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon.Points%2A> property to specify the vertices of a shape. A line is automatically drawn that connects the first and last points. Finally, specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A>, or both.  \n  \n## Example  \n In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], valid syntax for points is a space-delimited list of comma-separated x- and y-coordinate pairs.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[drawingwithshapeelements#PolygonExample1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/polygonexample.xaml#polygonexample1)]  \n  \n Although the example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to contain the polygons, you can use polygon elements (and all the other shape elements) with any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that supports non-text content.  \n  \n This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,344],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"graphics [WPF], Polygon elements\"\n  - \"closed shapes [WPF], drawing with Polygon elements\"\n  - \"Polygon elements [WPF]\"\n  - \"drawing [WPF], closed shapes with Polygon elements\"\nms.assetid: 4b0ca008-29ce-48dd-8bc3-f3a20ffca6a6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","pos":[0,56]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[351,407],"content":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","linkify":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Closed Shape by Using the Polygon Element","pos":[0,56]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to draw a closed shape by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[408,512],"source":"This example shows how to draw a closed shape by using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element."},{"content":"To draw a closed shape, create a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon&gt;</ph> element and use its <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon.Points%2A&gt;</ph> property to specify the vertices of a shape.","pos":[513,694],"source":" To draw a closed shape, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon.Points%2A> property to specify the vertices of a shape."},{"content":"A line is automatically drawn that connects the first and last points.","pos":[695,765]},{"content":"Finally, specify a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A&gt;</ph>, a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A&gt;</ph>, or both.","pos":[766,885],"source":" Finally, specify a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A>, or both."},{"pos":[894,901],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[905,1074],"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph>, valid syntax for points is a space-delimited list of comma-separated x- and y-coordinate pairs.","source":"In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], valid syntax for points is a space-delimited list of comma-separated x- and y-coordinate pairs."},{"pos":[1249,1523],"content":"Although the example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas&gt;</ph> to contain the polygons, you can use polygon elements (and all the other shape elements) with any <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control&gt;</ph> that supports non-text content.","source":"Although the example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to contain the polygons, you can use polygon elements (and all the other shape elements) with any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that supports non-text content."},{"pos":[1530,1672],"content":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>.","source":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)."}]}
