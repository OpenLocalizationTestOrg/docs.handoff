For details about writing COM servers that tightly integrate with the .NET Framework, see [Design Considerations for Interoperation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b59637f6-fe35-40d6-ae72-901e7a707689).  \n  \n Existing COM components are valuable resources in managed code as middle-tier business applications or as isolated functionality. An ideal component has a primary interop assembly and conforms tightly to the programming standards imposed by COM.  \n  \n#### To expose COM components to the .NET Framework  \n  \n1.  [Import a type library as an assembly](../../../docs/framework/interop/importing-a-type-library-as-an-assembly.md).  \n  \n     The common language runtime requires metadata for all types, including COM types. There are several ways to obtain an assembly containing COM types imported as metadata.  \n  \n2.  [Create COM types in managed Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1a95a8ca-c8b8-4464-90b0-5ee1a1135b66).  \n  \n     You can inspect COM types, activate instances, and invoke methods on the COM object the same way you do for any managed type.  \n  \n3.  [Compile an interop project](../../../docs/framework/interop/compiling-an-interop-project.md).  \n  \n     The [!INCLUDE[winsdklong](../../../includes/winsdklong-md.md)] provides compilers for several languages compliant with the Common Language Specification (CLS), including [!INCLUDE[vbprvblong](../../../includes/vbprvblong-md.md)], C#, and C++.  \n  \n4.  [Deploy an interop application](../../../docs/framework/interop/deploying-an-interop-application.md).  \n  \n     Interop applications are best deployed as [strong-named](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/strong-named-assemblies.md), signed assemblies in the global assembly cache.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Interoperating with Unmanaged
