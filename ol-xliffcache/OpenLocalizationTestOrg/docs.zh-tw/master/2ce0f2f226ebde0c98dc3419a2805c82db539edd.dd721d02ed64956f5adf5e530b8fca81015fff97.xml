Any error with your XML markup will generate CS1570. For example:  \n  \n-   If you are passing a string to a **cref**, such as in an [\\<exception>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/exception.md) tag, the string must be enclosed in double quotation marks.  \n  \n-   If you are using a tag, such as [\\<seealso>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/seealso.md), which does not have a closing tag, you must specify a forward slash before the closing angle bracket.  \n  \n-   If you need to use a greater-than or less-than symbol in the text of description, you need to represent them with **&gt;** or **&lt;**.  \n  \n-   The file or path attribute on an [\\<include>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/include.md) tag was missing or improperly formed.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS1570:  \n  \n```  \n// CS1570.cs  \n// compile with: /W:1  \nnamespace ns  \n{  \n   // the following line generates CS1570  \n   /// <summary> returns true if < 5 </summary>  \n   // try this instead  \n   // /// <summary> returns true if <5 </summary>  \n  \n   public class MyClass  \n   {  \n      public static void Main ()  \n      {  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1570 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1570 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[577,610],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1570","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1570","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1570","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"XML comment on 'construct' has badly formed XML — 'reason'","pos":[611,669]},{"content":"When using <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/doc<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/doc-compiler-option.md)</ept>, any comments in the source code must be in XML.","pos":[676,815],"source":"When using [/doc](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/doc-compiler-option.md), any comments in the source code must be in XML."},{"content":"Any error with your XML markup will generate CS1570.","pos":[816,868]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[869,881]},{"pos":[891,1074],"content":"If you are passing a string to a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>cref<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, such as in an <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>exception&gt;<ept id=\"p2\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/exception.md)</ept> tag, the string must be enclosed in double quotation marks.","source":"If you are passing a string to a **cref**, such as in an [\\<exception>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/exception.md) tag, the string must be enclosed in double quotation marks."},{"pos":[1084,1281],"content":"If you are using a tag, such as <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>seealso&gt;<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/seealso.md)</ept>, which does not have a closing tag, you must specify a forward slash before the closing angle bracket.","source":"If you are using a tag, such as [\\<seealso>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/seealso.md), which does not have a closing tag, you must specify a forward slash before the closing angle bracket."},{"pos":[1291,1426],"content":"If you need to use a greater-than or less-than symbol in the text of description, you need to represent them with <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph><ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt><ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;lt;</ph><ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"If you need to use a greater-than or less-than symbol in the text of description, you need to represent them with **&gt;** or **&lt;**."},{"pos":[1436,1569],"content":"The file or path attribute on an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>include&gt;<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/include.md)</ept> tag was missing or improperly formed.","source":"The file or path attribute on an [\\<include>](../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/include.md) tag was missing or improperly formed."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1570:","pos":[1576,1614]}]}
