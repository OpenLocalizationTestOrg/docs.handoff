Among the options it offers are: whether to send the deleted file to the **Recycle Bin**, whether to ask the user to confirm that the file should be deleted, and what to do when the user cancels the operation.  \n  \n### To delete a text file  \n  \n-   Use the `DeleteFile` method to delete the file. The following code demonstrates how to delete the file named `test.txt`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#22](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-delete-a-file_1.vb)]  \n  \n### To delete a text file and ask the user to confirm that the file should be deleted  \n  \n-   Use the `DeleteFile` method to delete the file, setting `showUI` to `AllDialogs`. The following code demonstrates how to delete the file named `test.txt` and allow the user to confirm that the file should be deleted.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#9](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-delete-a-file_2.vb)]  \n  \n### To delete a text file and send it to the Recycle Bin  \n  \n-   Use the `DeleteFile` method to delete the file, specifying `SendToRecycleBin` for the `recycle` parameter. The following code demonstrates how to delete the file named `test.txt` and send it to the **Recycle Bin**.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#10](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-delete-a-file_3.vb)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\\\\\.\\\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   A file or folder name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   The file is in use (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n-   The file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have permission to delete the file, or the file is read-only (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  \n  \n-   A partial-trust situation exists in which the user does not have sufficient permissions (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n-   The user cancelled the operation and `onUserCancel` is set to `ThrowException` (<xref:System.OperationCanceledException>).  \n  \n## See Also  \n
