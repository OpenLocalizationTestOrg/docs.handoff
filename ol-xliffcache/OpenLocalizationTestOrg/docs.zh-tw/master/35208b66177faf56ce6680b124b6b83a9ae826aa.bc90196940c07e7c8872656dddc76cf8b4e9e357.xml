Often localizers need to re-size and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called              `auto layout`.  \n  \n The following              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text. Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to              `Auto`; therefore the cell that contains the button with an image adjusts to fit the image. Because the              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element can adjust to its content it can be useful when taking the automatic layout approach to designing applications that can be localized.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use a grid.  \n  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationGrid#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationGrid/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the output of the code sample.  \n  \n ![Grid example](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/glob-grid.png \"glob_grid\")  \nGrid  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Use Automatic Layout Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/use-automatic-layout-overview.md)   \n [Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-use-automatic-layout-to-create-a-button.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,454],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]}],"pos":[6,65],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-wpf\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"grids, automatic layout\"\n  - \"automatic layout, grid use\"\nms.assetid: ab9de407-e0c1-4047-bdf0-24951bf73879\ncaps.latest.revision: 13\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[461,500],"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","linkify":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"This example describes how to use a grid in the automatic layout approach to creating a localizable application.","pos":[501,613]},{"content":"Localization of a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> can be a time consuming process.","pos":[620,749],"source":"Localization of a              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process."},{"content":"Often localizers need to re-size and reposition elements in addition to translating text.","pos":[750,839]},{"content":"In the past each language that a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> was adapted for required adjustment.","pos":[840,990],"source":" In the past each language that a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment."},{"content":"Now with the capabilities of              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment.","pos":[991,1173],"source":" Now with the capabilities of              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment."},{"content":"The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called              <ph id=\"ph1\">`auto layout`</ph>.","pos":[1174,1298],"source":" The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called              `auto layout`."},{"content":"The following              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text.","pos":[1305,1470],"source":"The following              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text."},{"content":"Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to              <ph id=\"ph1\">`Auto`</ph>;
