Unlike a `Function` procedure, a `Sub` does not return a value, and therefore cannot contain a type declaration.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30303  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the `Sub` procedure to a `Function` procedure.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Sub Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/sub-procedures.md)\n- [Function Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/function-procedures.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,252],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30303\"\n  - \"vbc30303\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30303\"\nms.assetid: f5a744f0-d312-4fe3-90cd-3cf372a93664","nodes":[{"content":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","nodes":[{"pos":[0,91],"content":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","nodes":[{"content":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","pos":[0,91]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[259,350],"content":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","linkify":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","nodes":[{"content":"Type character cannot be used in a 'Sub' declaration because a 'Sub' doesn't return a value","pos":[0,91]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub`</ph> procedure, like a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Function`</ph> procedure, is a separate procedure that can take arguments and perform a series of statements.","pos":[351,482],"source":"A `Sub` procedure, like a `Function` procedure, is a separate procedure that can take arguments and perform a series of statements."},{"content":"Unlike a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Function`</ph> procedure, a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Sub`</ph> does not return a value, and therefore cannot contain a type declaration.","pos":[483,595],"source":" Unlike a `Function` procedure, a `Sub` does not return a value, and therefore cannot contain a type declaration."},{"pos":[602,623],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30303","source":"**Error ID:** BC30303"},{"pos":[632,653],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[663,716],"content":"Change the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub`</ph> procedure to a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Function`</ph> procedure.","source":"Change the `Sub` procedure to a `Function` procedure."},{"pos":[725,733],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[737,838],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Sub Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/sub-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Sub Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/sub-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[841,952],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Function Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/function-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Function Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/function-procedures.md)"}]}
