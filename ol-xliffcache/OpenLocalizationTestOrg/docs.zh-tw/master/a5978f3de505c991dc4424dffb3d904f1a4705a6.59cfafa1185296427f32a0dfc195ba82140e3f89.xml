Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.  \n  \n This error occurs when overload resolution has failed. It occurs as a subordinate message that indicates why a particular overload candidate has been eliminated. The error explains that if type inference is applied to determine the data type of the type parameters of the called generic procedure, the compiler finds more than one possible data type for at least one of them.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When specifying arguments is not an option (for example, for query operators in query expressions), the error message appears without the second sentence.  \n  \n For more information and examples, see [Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method '\\<methodname>' cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible](../../visual-basic/misc/bc36651-bc36654.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36653 and BC36650  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Generic Procedures in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-procedures.md)   \n [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,145],"content":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,133]}]},{"pos":[704,820],"content":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible","linkify":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible","nodes":[{"content":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible","pos":[0,116]}]},{"content":"Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible.","pos":[821,938]},{"content":"Specifying the data type(s) explicitly might correct this error.","pos":[939,1003]},{"content":"This error occurs when overload resolution has failed.","pos":[1010,1064]},{"content":"It occurs as a subordinate message that indicates why a particular overload candidate has been eliminated.","pos":[1065,1171]},{"content":"The error explains that if type inference is applied to determine the data type of the type parameters of the called generic procedure, the compiler finds more than one possible data type for at least one of them.","pos":[1172,1385]},{"pos":[1393,1558],"content":"[!NOTE]\n When specifying arguments is not an option (for example, for query operators in query expressions), the error message appears without the second sentence.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"When specifying arguments is not an option (for example, for query operators in query expressions), the error message appears without the second sentence.","pos":[9,163]}]},{"pos":[1565,1793],"content":"For more information and examples, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>methodname&gt;' cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/misc/bc36651-bc36654.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information and examples, see [Data type(s) of the type parameter(s) in method '\\<methodname>' cannot be inferred from these arguments because more than one type is possible](../../visual-basic/misc/bc36651-bc36654.md)."},{"pos":[1800,1833],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36653 and BC36650","source":"**Error ID:** BC36653 and BC36650"},{"pos":[1842,1850],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Generic Procedures in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-procedures.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1854,1980],"source":"[Generic Procedures in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-procedures.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Overload Resolution<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)</ept>","pos":[1983,2095],"source":" [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)"}]}
