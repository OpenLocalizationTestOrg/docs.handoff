When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `GetMemoryLoad` wraps the Win32 `GlobalMemoryStatus` function. The value of `pMemoryLoad` is the equivalent of the `dwMemoryLoad` field in the `MEMORYSTATUS` structure returned from `GlobalMemoryStatus`.  \n  \n The runtime uses the return value as a heuristic for the garbage collector. For example, if the host reports that the majority of memory is in use, the garbage collector may elect to collect from multiple generations to increase the amount of memory that can potentially become available.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:**
