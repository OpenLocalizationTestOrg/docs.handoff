If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`. If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error. If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30912  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the property name correctly.  \n  \n2.  Avoid accessing the property in the way (reading or writing) that generated this message.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,234],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<keyword>' accessor of '<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30912\"\n  - \"bc30912\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30912\"\nms.assetid: f1fa965e-090c-49f3-ab1e-cbb2f9b2a5f0","nodes":[{"content":"'<keyword>' accessor of '<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,73],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;keyword&gt;</ph>' accessor of '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;propertyname&gt;</ph>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","source":"'<keyword>' accessor of '<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[241,316],"content":"'\\<keyword>' accessor of '\\<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","linkify":"'\\<keyword>' accessor of '\\<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>keyword&gt;' accessor of '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>propertyname&gt;' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","pos":[0,75],"source":"'\\<keyword>' accessor of '\\<propertyname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)"}]},{"pos":[317,513],"content":"A statement attempts to read or write a property for which the corresponding procedure has been marked with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error.","source":"A statement attempts to read or write a property for which the corresponding procedure has been marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error."},{"content":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> to it.","pos":[520,633],"source":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> to it."},{"content":"If you do this, you can set the attribute's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A&gt;</ph> property to either <ph id=\"ph2\">`True`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`False`</ph>.","pos":[634,758],"source":" If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`True`</ph>, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error.","pos":[759,846],"source":" If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`False`</ph>, or let it default to <ph id=\"ph2\">`False`</ph>, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.","pos":[847,975],"source":" If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element."},{"pos":[982,1003],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30912","source":"**Error ID:** BC30912"},{"pos":[1012,1033],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the property name correctly.","pos":[1043,1121]},{"content":"Avoid accessing the property in the way (reading or writing) that generated this message.","pos":[1131,1220]},{"pos":[1229,1237],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1241,1352],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)"}]}
