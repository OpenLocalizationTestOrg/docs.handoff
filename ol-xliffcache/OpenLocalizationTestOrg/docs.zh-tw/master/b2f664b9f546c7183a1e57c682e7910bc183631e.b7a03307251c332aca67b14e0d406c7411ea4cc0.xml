This design is based on the new manifest-driven componentization technology introduced in [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)]. There are more than 40 standalone feature components of [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] that can be installed independently. This allows IT professionals to easily customize the installation as required. This topic discusses how to configure [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] for use with [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and determine which components are required.  \n  \n## Minimal Installation: Installing WAS  \n The minimal installation of the whole [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] package is to install the Windows Process Activation Service (WAS). WAS is a standalone feature and it is the only feature from the [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] that is available for all [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)] operating systems (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate and Enterprise).  \n  \n From the Control Panel, click **Programs** and then click **Turn Windows features on or off** which is listed under **Programs and Features**, the WAS component is shown in the list as in the following illustration.  \n  \n ![Turn Features On or Off Dialog](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/wcfc-turnfeaturesonoroffs.gif \"wcfc_TurnFeaturesOnOrOffs\")  \n  \n This feature has the following sub-components:  \n  \n-   .NET Environment  \n  \n-   Configuration APIs  \n  \n-   Process Model  \n  \n If you select the root node of WAS, only the **Process Model** sub-node is checked by default. Please note that with this installation you are only installing WAS, because there is no support for a Web server.  \n  \n To make [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] or any [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application to work, check the **.NET Environment** checkbox. This means that all of WAS components are required to make [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] to work well. These are automatically checked once you install any of those components.  \n  \n## IIS 7.0: Default Installation  \n By checking the **Internet Information Services** feature, some of the sub-nodes are automatically checked as shown in the following illustration.  \n  \n ![Default settings for IIS 7.0 features](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/wcfc-turningfeaturesonoroff2.gif \"wcfc_TurningFeaturesOnOrOff2\")  \n  \n This is the default installation of [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]. With this installation, you can use [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] to service static content (such as HTML pages and other content). However, you cannot run [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] or CGI applications or host [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services.  \n  \n## IIS 7.0: Installation with ASP.NET Support  \n You must install [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] to make [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] work on IIS 7.0. After checking **ASP.NET**, your screen should look like the following illustration.  \n  \n ![Asp.NET required settings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/wcfc-trunfeaturesonoroff3s.gif \"wcfc_TrunFeaturesOnOrOFf3s\")  \n  \n This is the minimal environment for both [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] applications to work in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)].  \n  \n## IIS 7.0: Installation with IIS 6.0 Compatibility Components  \n When installing [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] on a system with Visual Studio 2005 or some other automation scripts or tools (such as Adsutil.vbs) that configure virtual applications that use [!INCLUDE[iis601](../../../../includes/iis601-md.md)] Metabase API, ensure that you check the [!INCLUDE[iis601](../../../../includes/iis601-md.md)]**Scripting Tools**. This automatically checks the other sub-nodes of [!INCLUDE[iis601](../../../../includes/iis601-md.md)]**Management Compatibility**. The following illustration shows the screen after this is done.  \n  \n ![IIS 6.0 Management Compatibility Settings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/scfc-turnfeaturesonoroff5s.gif \"scfc_TurnFeaturesOnOrOff5s\")  \n  \n With this installation, you have everything required to use [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] features and samples available on the Web.  \n  \n## Request Limits  \n On [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)] with IIS 7 the default value of the `maxUri` and `maxQueryStringSize` settings have been changed. By default, request filtering in IIS 7.0 allows a URL length of 4096 characters and a query string length of 2048 characters. To change these defaults add the following XML to your App.config file.  \n  \n `<system.webServer>`  \n  \n `<security>`  \n  \n `<requestFiltering>`  \n  \n `<requestLimits maxUrl=\"8192\" maxQueryString=\"8192\" />`  \n  \n `</requestFiltering>`  \n  \n `</security>`  \n  \n `</system.webServer>`  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WAS Activation
