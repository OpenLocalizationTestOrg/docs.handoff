To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.  \n  \n To resolve this error, put all member variables in a single partial class definition.  \n  \n A common way to get this error is by having a partial `struct` defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another.  \n  \n The following code generates CS0282.  \n  \n## Example  \n This code contains one description of a `struct`. Compile these two modules together in a single step by means of the command:  \n  \n `csc /targt:library cs0282_1.cs cs0282_2.cs`  \n  \n```  \npartial struct A  \n{  \n    int i;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n This code contains a conflicting description of the same `struct`.  \n  \n```  \npartial struct A  \n{  \n    int j;  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[578,611],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"There is no defined ordering between fields in multiple declarations of partial class or struct 'type'.","pos":[612,715]},{"content":"To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.","pos":[716,792]},{"content":"To resolve this error, put all member variables in a single partial class definition.","pos":[799,884]},{"pos":[891,1059],"content":"A common way to get this error is by having a partial <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph> defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another.","source":"A common way to get this error is by having a partial `struct` defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another."},{"content":"The following code generates CS0282.","pos":[1066,1102]},{"pos":[1111,1118],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This code contains one description of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph>.","pos":[1122,1171],"source":"This code contains one description of a `struct`."},{"content":"Compile these two modules together in a single step by means of the command:","pos":[1172,1248]},{"pos":[1363,1370],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1374,1440],"content":"This code contains a conflicting description of the same <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph>.","source":"This code contains a conflicting description of the same `struct`."}]}
