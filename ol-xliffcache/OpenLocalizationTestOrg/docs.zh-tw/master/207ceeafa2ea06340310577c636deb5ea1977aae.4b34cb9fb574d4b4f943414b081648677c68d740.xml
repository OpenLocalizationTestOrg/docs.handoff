Windows Forms support two different types of Help, each provided by the [HelpProvider Component](../controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md). The first involves pointing the user to a Help file of either HTML or HTML Help 1.*x* or greater format. The second can display brief \"What's This\"-type Help on individual controls; this is especially useful on dialog boxes. Both types of Help can be used on the same form.  \n  \n Additionally, the [ToolTip Component](../controls/tooltip-component-windows-forms.md) can be used to provide individual Help for controls on Windows Forms.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Provide Help in a Windows Application](how-to-provide-help-in-a-windows-application.md)  \n Explains how to use the `HelpProvider` component to link controls to files in a Help system.  \n  \n [How to: Display Pop-up Help](how-to-display-pop-up-help.md)  \n Explains how to use the `HelpProvider` component to show pop-up Help on Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Control Help Using ToolTips](control-help-using-tooltips.md)  \n Describes using the `ToolTip` component to show control-specific Help.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [HelpProvider Component](../controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains the basics of the `HelpProvider` component.  \n  \n [ToolTip Component](../controls/tooltip-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains the basics of the `ToolTip` component.  \n  \n [Windows Forms Overview](../windows-forms-overview.md)  \n Explains the basics of Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Windows Forms](../index.md)  \n Provides an overview of Windows Forms.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,477],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Help [Windows Forms], Windows Forms (using designer)\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, Help (using designer)\"\n  - \"HTML Help [Windows Forms], Windows Forms (using designer)\"\n  - \"Help [Windows Forms], Windows applications (using designer)\"\n  - \"forms.
