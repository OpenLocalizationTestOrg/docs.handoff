It then finds the `id` attribute of the parent element.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md).  \n  \n```vb  \nDim books As XDocument = XDocument.Load(\"Books.xml\")  \nDim author As XElement = books.Root.<Book>.<Author>.FirstOrDefault()  \n  \n' LINQ to XML query  \nDim att1 As XAttribute = author.Parent.Attribute(\"id\")  \n  \n' XPath expression  \nDim att2 As XAttribute = DirectCast(author.XPathEvaluate(\"../@id\"),  _  \n    IEnumerable).Cast(Of XAttribute)().First()  \n  \nIf att1 Is att2 Then  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results are identical\")  \nElse  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results differ\")  \nEnd If  \nConsole.WriteLine(att1)  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nResults are identical  \nid=\"bk101\"  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,156],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 9d2572fd-27d4-426c-b079-16854cb9ec7d","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,74],"content":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,74]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[163,237],"content":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find an Attribute of the Parent (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,74]}]},{"content":"This topic shows how to navigate to the parent element and find an attribute of it.","pos":[238,321]},{"content":"The XPath expression is:","pos":[328,352]},{"pos":[376,383],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This example first finds an <ph id=\"ph1\">`Author`</ph> element.","pos":[387,432],"source":"This example first finds an `Author` element."},{"content":"It then finds the <ph id=\"ph1\">`id`</ph> attribute of the parent element.","pos":[433,488],"source":" It then finds the `id` attribute of the parent element."},{"pos":[495,675],"content":"This example uses the following XML document: <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>.","source":"This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)."},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[1212,1255]},{"pos":[1316,1324],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1328,1461],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-for-xpath-users.md)"}]}
