The form has **Start** and **Cancel** buttons. Click the **Start** button to run an asynchronous operation. Click the **Cancel** button to stop a running asynchronous operation. The outcome of each operation is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox>.  \n  \n There is extensive support for this task in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Running an Operation in the Background](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233672\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker.Example/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
