Range variable(s) \\<variable(s)> must appear on one side of the 'Equals' operator, and range variable(s) \\<variable(s)> must appear on the other.  \n  \n Range variables identified for collections to be joined in a LINQ query must be on opposite sides of the `Equals` operator, depending on the collection they are identified for. That is, range variables identified for one of the collections being joined must be on the opposite side of the `Equals` operator from range variables for the other collection being joined. Range variables from separate collections cannot be mixed on the same side of the `Equals` operator.  \n  \n At least one variable from each collection being joined must be referenced on each side of the `Equals` operator.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36622  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)\n- [LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)\n- [Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/join-clause.md)\n- [Group Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-join-clause.md)\n- [From Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/from-clause.md)\n- [Select Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/select-clause.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,246],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36622\"\n  - \"bc36622\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36622\"\nms.assetid: 8d301227-131d-4977-b3ff-1fc4e427f8fa","nodes":[{"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","nodes":[{"pos":[0,85],"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","nodes":[{"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","pos":[0,85]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[253,338],"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","linkify":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","nodes":[{"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator","pos":[0,85]}]},{"content":"You must reference at least one range variable on both sides of the 'Equals' operator.","pos":[339,425]},{"content":"Range variable(s) <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>variable(s)&gt;
