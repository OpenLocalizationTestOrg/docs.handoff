section list various security-related items to consider when designing a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] application.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Information Disclosure](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/information-disclosure.md)  \n Discusses the various ways that information can be disclosed or attacked, and how to mitigate this.  \n  \n [Elevation of Privilege](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/elevation-of-privilege.md)  \n Discusses the effects of giving an attacker authorization permissions beyond those initially granted and how to mitigate this.  \n  \n [Denial of Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/denial-of-service.md)  \n Discusses what happens when a system is unable to process messages appropriately and how to mitigate it.  \n  \n [Tampering](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/tampering.md)  \n Discusses the altering of messages or the delivery of messages and how to mitigate it.  \n  \n [Replay Attacks](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/replay-attacks.md)  \n Discusses what happens when an attacker copies a stream of messages between two parties and replays the stream to one or more of the parties, and how to mitigate this.  \n  \n [Security Considerations for Secure Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-considerations-for-secure-sessions.md)  \n Discusses the following items that affect security when implementing secure sessions.  \n  \n [Unsupported Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/unsupported-scenarios.md)  \n Lists various scenarios that do not support a particular aspect of security and should be avoided or considered.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.IdentityModel.Tokens>  \n  \n <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security>  \n  \n
