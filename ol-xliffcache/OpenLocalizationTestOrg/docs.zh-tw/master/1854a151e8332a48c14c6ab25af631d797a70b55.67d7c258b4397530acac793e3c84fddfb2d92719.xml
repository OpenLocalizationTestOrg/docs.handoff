responsive to your user while maximizing the performance of your user's computer.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Threading](../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)  \n Describes the basic concurrency and synchronization mechanisms provided by the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [Asynchronous Programming Patterns](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/index.md)  \n Provides a brief overview of the three asynchronous programming patterns supported in the .NET Framework:  \n  \n-   [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm.md) (legacy)  \n  \n-   [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-eap.md) (legacy)  \n  \n-   [Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)](../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap.md) (recommended for new development)  \n  \n [Parallel Programming](../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md)  \n Describes a task-based programming model that simplifies parallel development, enabling you to write efficient, fine-grained, and scalable parallel code in a natural idiom without having to work directly with threads or the thread pool.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Development
