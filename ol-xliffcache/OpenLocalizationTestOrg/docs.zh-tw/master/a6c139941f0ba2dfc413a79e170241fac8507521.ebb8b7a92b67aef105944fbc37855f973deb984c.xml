However, by using the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, you can define an unsafe context in which pointers can be used. For more information about pointers, see the topic [Pointer types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the common language runtime (CLR), unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code. Unsafe code in C# is not necessarily dangerous; it is just code whose safety cannot be verified by the CLR. The CLR will therefore only execute unsafe code if it is in a fully trusted assembly. If you use unsafe code, it is your responsibility to ensure that your code does not introduce security risks or pointer errors.  \n  \n## Unsafe Code Overview  \n Unsafe code has the following properties:  \n  \n-   Methods, types, and code blocks can be defined as unsafe.  \n  \n-   In some cases, unsafe code may increase an application's performance by removing array bounds checks.  \n  \n-   Unsafe code is required when you call native functions that require pointers.  \n  \n-   Using unsafe code introduces security and stability risks.  \n  \n-   In order for C# to compile unsafe code, the application must be compiled with [/unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n For more information, see:  \n  \n-   [Pointer types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md)  \n  \n-   [Fixed Size Buffers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/fixed-size-buffers.md)  \n  \n-   [How to: Use Pointers to Copy an Array of Bytes](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/how-to-use-pointers-to-copy-an-array-of-bytes.md)  \n  \n-   [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md)  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,76],"content":"Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[752,799],"content":"Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"To maintain type safety and security, C# does not support pointer arithmetic, by default.","pos":[800,889]},{"content":"However, by using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>unsafe<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md)</ept> keyword, you can define an unsafe context in which pointers can be used.","pos":[890,1048],"source":" However, by using the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, you can define an unsafe context in which pointers can be used."},{"content":"For more information about pointers, see the topic <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Pointer types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md)</ept>.","pos":[1049,1189],"source":" For more information about pointers, see the topic [Pointer types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/pointer-types.md)."},{"pos":[1197,1616],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In the common language runtime (CLR), unsafe code is referred to as unverifiable code.
