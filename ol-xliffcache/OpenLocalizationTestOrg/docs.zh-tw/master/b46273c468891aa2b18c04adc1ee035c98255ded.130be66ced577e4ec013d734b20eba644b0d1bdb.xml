For more information about data contracts and how they are used, see [Using Data Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-data-contracts.md).  \n  \n For a tutorial that walks through the steps of creating a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service and client, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md). For a working sample application that consists of a basic service and client, see [Basic Data Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-data-contract.md).  \n  \n### To create a basic data contract for a class or structure  \n  \n1.  Declare that the type has a data contract by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute to the class. Note that all public types, including those without attributes, are serializable. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> infers a data contract if the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute is absent. For more information, see [Serializable Types](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/serializable-types.md).  \n  \n2.  Define the members (properties, fields, or events) that are serialized by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute to each member. These members are called data members. By default, all public types are serializable. For more information, see [Serializable Types](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/serializable-types.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute to private fields, causing the data to be exposed to others. Be sure that the member does not contain sensitive data.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to create a data contract for the `Person` type by applying the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes to the class and its members.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DataContractAttribute#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/datacontractattribute/cs/overview.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[DataContractAttribute#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/datacontractattribute/vb/overview.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute>\n- <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute>\n- [Using Data Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-data-contracts.md)\n- [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md)\n- [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,323],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Basic Data Contract for a Class or Structure\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
