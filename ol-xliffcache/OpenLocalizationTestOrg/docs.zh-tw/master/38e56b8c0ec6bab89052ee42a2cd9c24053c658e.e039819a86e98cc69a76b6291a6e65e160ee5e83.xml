Any `Boolean` variable. The result is a `Boolean` value indicating whether or not the `string` satisfies the `pattern`.  \n  \n `string`  \n Required. Any `String` expression.  \n  \n `pattern`  \n Required. Any `String` expression conforming to the pattern-matching conventions described in \"Remarks.\"  \n  \n## Remarks  \n If the value in `string` satisfies the pattern contained in `pattern`, `result` is `True`. If the string does not satisfy the pattern, `result` is `False`. If both `string` and `pattern` are empty strings, the result is `True`.  \n  \n## Comparison Method  \n The behavior of the `Like` operator depends on the [Option Compare Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-compare-statement.md). The default string comparison method for each source file is `Option Compare Binary`.  \n  \n## Pattern Options  \n Built-in pattern matching provides a versatile tool for string comparisons. The pattern-matching features allow you to match each character in `string` against a specific character, a wildcard character, a character list, or a character range. The following table shows the characters allowed in `pattern` and what they match.  \n  \n|Characters in `pattern`|Matches in `string`|  \n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|  \n|`?`|Any single character|  \n|`*`|Zero or more characters|  \n|`#`|Any single digit (0–9)|  \n|`[charlist]`|Any single character in `charlist`|  \n|`[!charlist]`|Any single character not in `charlist`|  \n  \n## Character Lists  \n A group of one or more characters (`charlist`) enclosed in brackets (`[ ]`) can be used to match any single character in `string` and can include almost any character code, including digits.  \n  \n An exclamation point (`!`) at the beginning of `charlist` means that a match is made if any character except the characters in `charlist` is found in `string`. When used outside brackets, the exclamation point matches itself.  \n  \n## Special Characters  \n To match the special characters left bracket (`[`), question mark (`?`), number sign (`#`), and asterisk (`*`), enclose them in brackets. The right bracket (`]`) cannot be used within a group to match itself, but it can be used outside a group as an individual character.  \n  \n The character sequence `[]` is considered a zero-length string (`\"\"`). However, it cannot be part of a character list enclosed in brackets. If you want to check whether a position in `string` contains one of a group of characters or no character at all, you can use `Like` twice. For an example, see [How to: Match a String against a Pattern](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/how-to-match-a-string-against-a-pattern.md).  \n  \n## Character Ranges  \n By using a hyphen (`–`) to separate the lower and upper bounds of the range, `charlist` can specify a range of characters. For example, `[A–Z]` results in a match if the corresponding character position in `string` contains any character within the range `A`–`Z`, and `[!H–L]` results in a match if the corresponding character position contains any character outside the range `H`–`L`.  \n  \n When you specify a range of characters, they must appear in ascending sort order, that is, from lowest to highest. Thus, `[A–Z]` is a valid pattern, but `[Z–A]` is not.  \n  \n### Multiple Character Ranges  \n To specify multiple ranges for the same character position, put them within the same brackets without delimiters. For example, `[A–CX–Z]` results in a match if the corresponding character position in `string` contains any character within either the range `A`–`C` or the range `X`–`Z`.  \n  \n### Usage of the Hyphen  \n A hyphen (`–`) can appear either at the beginning (after an exclamation point, if any) or at the end of `charlist` to match itself. In any other location, the hyphen identifies a range of characters delimited by the characters on either side of the hyphen.  \n  \n## Collating Sequence  \n The meaning of a specified range depends on the character ordering at run time, as determined by `Option Compare` and the locale setting of the system the code is running on. With `Option Compare Binary`, the range `[A–E]` matches `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and `E`. With `Option Compare Text`, `[A–E]` matches `A`, `a`, `À`, `à`, `B`, `b`, `C`, `c`, `D`, `d`, `E`, and `e`. The range does not match `Ê` or `ê` because accented characters collate after unaccented characters in the sort order.  \n  \n## Digraph Characters  \n In some languages, there are alphabetic characters that represent two separate characters. For example, several languages use the character `æ` to represent the characters `a` and `e` when they appear together. The `Like` operator recognizes that the single digraph character and the two individual characters are equivalent.  \n  \n When a language that uses a digraph character is specified in the system locale settings, an occurrence of the single digraph character in either `pattern` or `string` matches the equivalent two-character sequence in the other string. Similarly, a digraph character in `pattern` enclosed in brackets (by itself, in a list, or in a range) matches the equivalent two-character sequence in `string`.  \n  \n## Overloading  \n The `Like` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example uses the `Like` operator to compare strings to various patterns. The results go into a `Boolean` variable indicating whether each string satisfies the pattern.  \n  \n
