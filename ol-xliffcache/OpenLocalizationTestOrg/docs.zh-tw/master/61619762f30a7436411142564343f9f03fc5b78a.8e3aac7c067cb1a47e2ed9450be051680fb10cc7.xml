That is, the Visual Basic compiler cannot determine whether the less-than character (<) is intended as a comparative operator or the start of an XML literal. The following code provides an example:  \n\n```vb  \n' Generates an error.  \nDim queryResult = From element In elements _  \n                  Where <sample>Value</sample> = \"Value\" _  \n                  Select element  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31198  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Enclose the XML literal declaration in parentheses, as shown in the following example:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim queryResult = From element In elements _  \n                  Where (<sample> Value</sample>) = \"Value\" _  \n                  Select element  \n```  \n  \n-   Modify your code to refer to an existing XML literal, as shown in the following example:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim queryResult = From element In elements _  \n                  Where e.<sample>.Value = \"Value\" _  \n                  Select element  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [XML Literals](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-literals/index.md)\n- [XML Axis Properties](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-axis/index.md)\n- [XML](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/xml/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,228],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31198\"\n  - \"vbc31198\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31198\"\nms.assetid: 97b16076-39ff-430a-9c65-073d01bcb08e","nodes":[{"content":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","nodes":[{"content":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","pos":[0,67]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[235,302],"content":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","linkify":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","nodes":[{"content":"XML literal cannot appear here unless it is enclosed in parentheses","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"An XML literal declaration is used in an expression in a location that is ambiguous to the Visual Basic compiler.","pos":[303,416]},{"content":"That is, the Visual Basic compiler cannot determine whether the less-than character (&lt;) is intended as a comparative operator or the start of an XML literal.","pos":[417,574],"source":" That is, the Visual Basic compiler cannot determine whether the less-than character (<) is intended as a comparative operator or the start of an XML literal."},{"content":"The following code provides an example:","pos":[575,614]},{"pos":[803,824],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31198","source":"**Error ID:** BC31198"},{"pos":[833,854],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Enclose the XML literal declaration in parentheses, as shown in the following example:","pos":[864,950]},{"content":"Modify your code to refer to an existing XML literal, as shown in the following example:","pos":[1123,1211]},{"pos":[1374,1382],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1386,1461],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Literals<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-literals/index.md)</ept>","source":"[XML Literals](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-literals/index.md)"},{"pos":[1464,1542],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Axis Properties<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-axis/index.md)</ept>","source":"[XML Axis Properties](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xml-axis/index.md)"},{"pos":[1545,1619],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/xml/index.md)</ept>","source":"[XML](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/xml/index.md)"}]}
