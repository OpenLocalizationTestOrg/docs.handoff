If you attempt to use these features in a Windows service, they may not work as expected.  \n  \n To build this set of applications, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] implements a host of services. This topic provides an overview of these services and where to find more information.  \n\n<a name=\"Application_Management\"></a>   \n## Application Management  \n Executable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications commonly require a core set of functionality that includes the following:  \n  \n-   Creating and managing common application infrastructure (including creating an entry point method and a Windows message loop to receive system and input messages).  \n  \n-   Tracking and interacting with the lifetime of an application.  \n  \n-   Retrieving and processing command-line parameters.  \n  \n-   Sharing application-scope properties and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] resources.  \n  \n-   Detecting and processing unhandled exceptions.  \n  \n-   Returning exit codes.  \n  \n-   Managing windows in standalone applications.  \n  \n-   Tracking navigation in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)], and standalone applications with navigation windows and frames.  \n  \n These capabilities are implemented by the <xref:System.Windows.Application> class, which you add to your applications using an *application definition*.  \n  \n For more information, see [Application Management Overview](application-management-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"WPF_Application_Resource__Content__and_Data_Files\"></a>   \n## WPF Application Resource, Content, and Data Files  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] extends the core support in the Microsoft .NET Framework for embedded resources with support for three kinds of non-executable data files: resource, content, and data. For more information, see [WPF Application Resource, Content, and Data Files](wpf-application-resource-content-and-data-files.md).  \n  \n A key component of the support for WPF non-executable data files is the ability to identify and load them using a unique [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)]. For more information, see [Pack URIs in WPF](pack-uris-in-wpf.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Windows_and_Dialog_Boxes\"></a>   \n## Windows and Dialog Boxes  \n Users interact with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] standalone applications through windows. The purpose of a window is to host application content and expose application functionality that usually allows users to interact with the content. In [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], windows are encapsulated by the <xref:System.Windows.Window> class, which supports:  \n  \n-   Creating and showing windows.  \n  \n-   Establishing owner/owned window relationships.  \n  \n-   Configuring window appearance (for example, size, location, icons, title bar text, border).  \n  \n-   Tracking and interacting with the lifetime of a window.  \n  \n For more information, see [WPF Windows Overview](wpf-windows-overview.md).  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Window> supports the ability to create a special type of window known as a dialog box. Both modal and modeless types of dialog boxes can be created.  \n  \n For convenience, and the benefits of reusability and a consistent user experience across applications, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] exposes three of the common Windows dialog boxes: <xref:Microsoft.Win32.OpenFileDialog>, <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SaveFileDialog>, and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PrintDialog>.  \n  \n A message box is a special type of dialog box for showing important textual information to users, and for asking simple Yes/No/OK/Cancel questions. You use the <xref:System.Windows.MessageBox> class to create and show message boxes.  \n  \n For more information, see [Dialog Boxes Overview](dialog-boxes-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Navigation\"></a>   \n## Navigation  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] supports Web-style navigation using pages (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>) and hyperlinks (<xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink>). Navigation can be implemented in a variety of ways that include the following:  \n  \n-   Standalone pages that are hosted in a Web browser.  \n  \n-   Pages compiled into an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] that is hosted in a Web browser.  \n  \n-   Pages compiled into a standalone application and hosted by a navigation window (<xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>).  \n  \n-   Pages that are hosted by a frame (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>), which may be hosted in a standalone page, or a page compiled into either an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] or a standalone application.  \n  \n To facilitate navigation, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] implements the following:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>, the shared navigation engine for processing navigation requests that is used by <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] to support intra-application navigation.  \n  \n-   Navigation methods to initiate navigation.  \n  \n-   Navigation events to track and interact with navigation lifetime.  \n  \n-   Remembering back and forward navigation using a journal, which can also be inspected and manipulated.  \n  \n For information, see [Navigation Overview](navigation-overview.md).  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] also supports a special type of navigation known as structured navigation. Structured navigation can be used to call one or more pages that return data in a structured and predictable way that is consistent with calling functions. This capability depends on the <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.PageFunction%601> class, which is described further in [Structured Navigation Overview](structured-navigation-overview.md). <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.PageFunction%601> also serves to simplify the creation of complex navigation topologies, which are described in [Navigation Topologies Overview](navigation-topologies-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Hosting\"></a>   \n## Hosting  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] can be hosted in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ie](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ie-md.md)] or Firefox. Each hosting model has its own set of considerations and constraints that are covered in [Hosting](hosting-wpf-applications.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Build_and_Deploy\"></a>   \n## Build and Deploy  \n Although simple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications can be built from a command prompt using command-line compilers, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] integrates with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] to provide additional support that simplified the development and build process. For more information, see [Building a WPF Application](building-a-wpf-application-wpf.md).  \n  \n Depending on the type of application you build, there are one or more deployment options to choose from. For more information, see [Deploying a WPF Application](deploying-a-wpf-application-wpf.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"related_topics\"></a>   \n## Related Topics  \n  \n|Title|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[Application Management Overview](application-management-overview.md)|Provides an overview of the <xref:System.Windows.Application> class including managing application lifetime, windows, application resources, and navigation.|  \n|[Windows in WPF](windows-in-wpf-applications.md)|Provides details of managing windows in your application including how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Window> class and dialog boxes.|  \n|[Navigation Overview](navigation-overview.md)|Provides an overview of managing navigation between pages of your application.|  \n|[Hosting](hosting-wpf-applications.md)|Provides an overview of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)].|  \n|[Build and Deploy](building-and-deploying-wpf-applications.md)|Describes how to build and deploy your WPF application.|  \n|[Introduction to WPF in Visual Studio](../getting-started/introduction-to-wpf-in-vs.md)|Describes the main features of WPF.|  \n|[Walkthrough: My first WPF desktop application](../getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application.md)|A walkthrough that shows how to create a WPF application using page navigation, layout, controls, images, styles, and binding.|\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,219],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Application Development\"\nms.date: \"01/26/2018\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WPF [WPF], about application development\"\n  - \"application development [WPF], about\"\nms.assetid: 2996ce5e-81e9-49ae-881b-952db3dd1b7e","nodes":[{"content":"Application Development","nodes":[{"pos":[0,23],"content":"Application Development","nodes":[{"content":"Application Development","pos":[0,23]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[226,249],"content":"Application Development","linkify":"Application Development","nodes":[{"content":"Application Development","pos":[0,23]}]},{"pos":[250,408],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">&lt;a name=\"introduction\"&gt;</bpt><ept id=\"p1\">&lt;/a&gt;</ept> Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a presentation framework that can be used to develop the following types of applications:","source":"<a name=\"introduction\"></a>\nWindows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a presentation framework that can be used to develop the following types of applications:"},{"pos":[418,633],"content":"Standalone Applications (traditional style <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)]</ph> applications built as executable assemblies that are installed to and run from the client computer).","source":"Standalone Applications (traditional style [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] applications built as executable assemblies that are installed to and run from the client computer)."},{"pos":[643,935],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)]</ph> (applications composed of navigation pages that are built as executable assemblies and hosted by Web browsers such as <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ie](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ie-md.md)]</ph> or Mozilla Firefox).","source":"[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] (applications composed of navigation pages that are built as executable assemblies and hosted by Web browsers such as [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ie](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ie-md.md)] or Mozilla Firefox)."},{"content":"Custom Control Libraries (non-executable assemblies containing reusable controls).","pos":[945,1027]},{"content":"Class Libraries (non-executable assemblies that contain reusable classes).","pos":[1037,1111]},{"pos":[1119,1281],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Using WPF types in a Windows service is strongly discouraged.
