Clients make calls to service operations and wait for a response from the service. You can perform calls to a service operation either synchronously, where the client blocks until it receives a response from the service or the call times, or asynchronously, where the client makes a call to the service operation, continues working, and receives the response from the service on another thread.  \n  \n To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic interface IRequestReplyCalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Add(double n1, double n2);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n You do not have to set the  <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `false` because this is the default behavior.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [One-Way Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md)\n- [Duplex Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,319],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Request-Reply Services\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Communication Foundation [WCF], request-reply services\"\n  - \"contracts [WCF], request-reply services\"\n  - \"WCF [WCF], request-reply services\"\n  - \"request-reply contracts [WCF]\"\nms.assetid: 2fa710f1-47f4-4598-b063-3ab3bd22ebba","nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Services","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"Request-Reply Services","nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Services","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[326,348],"content":"Request-Reply Services","linkify":"Request-Reply Services","nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Services","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Request-reply services are the default type of operation contract in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).","pos":[349,457]},{"content":"Clients make calls to service operations and wait for a response from the service.","pos":[458,540]},{"content":"You can perform calls to a service operation either synchronously, where the client blocks until it receives a response from the service or the call times, or asynchronously, where the client makes a call to the service operation, continues working, and receives the response from the service on another thread.","pos":[541,852]},{"pos":[859,1064],"content":"To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute&gt;</ph> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code.","source":"To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code."},{"pos":[1274,1425],"content":"You do not have to set the  <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph> because this is the default behavior.","source":"You do not have to set the  <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `false` because this is the default behavior."},{"pos":[1434,1442],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1446,1532],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>One-Way Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md)</ept>","source":"[One-Way Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md)"},{"pos":[1535,1619],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Duplex Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Duplex Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)"}]}
