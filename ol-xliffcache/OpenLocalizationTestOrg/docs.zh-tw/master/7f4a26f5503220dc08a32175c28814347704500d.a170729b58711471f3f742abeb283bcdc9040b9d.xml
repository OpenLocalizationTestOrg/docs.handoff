For an overview of all six of the tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.  \n  \n This topic disuccess the client configuration file that was generated using the Add Service Reference functionality of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] or the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md). Configuring the client consists of specifying the endpoint that the client uses to access the service. An endpoint has an address, a binding and a contract, and each of these must be specified in the process of configuring the client.  \n  \n### To configure a Windows Communication Foundation client  \n  \n1.  Open the generated configuration file (App.config) from the GettingStartedClient project. The following example is a view of the generated configuration file. Under the [\\<system.serviceModel>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/system-servicemodel.md) section, find the [\\<endpoint>](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/13aa23b7-2f08-4add-8dbf-a99f8127c017) element.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n    <configuration>  \n        <startup>   \n          <!-- specifies the version of WCF to use-->  \n            <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5,Profile=Client\" />  \n        </startup>  \n        <system.serviceModel>  \n            <bindings>  \n                <!-- Uses wsHttpBinding-->  \n                <wsHttpBinding>  \n                    <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\" />  \n                </wsHttpBinding>  \n            </bindings>  \n            <client>  \n                <!-- specifies the endpoint to use when calling the service -->  \n                <endpoint address=\"http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService\"  \n                    binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\"  \n                    contract=\"ServiceReference1.ICalculator\" name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\">  \n                    <identity>  \n                        <userPrincipalName value=\"migree@redmond.corp.microsoft.com\" />  \n                    </identity>  \n                </endpoint>  \n            </client>  \n        </system.serviceModel>  \n    </configuration><?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n    <configuration>  \n        <startup>   \n            <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5,Profile=Client\" />  \n        </startup>  \n        <system.serviceModel>  \n            <bindings>  \n                <wsHttpBinding>  \n                    <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\" />  \n                </wsHttpBinding>  \n            </bindings>  \n            <client>  \n                <endpoint address=\"http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService\"  \n                    binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\"  \n                    contract=\"ServiceReference1.ICalculator\" name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\">  \n                    <identity>  \n                        <userPrincipalName value=\"migree@redmond.corp.microsoft.com\" />  \n                    </identity>  \n                </endpoint>  \n            </client>  \n        </system.serviceModel>  \n    </configuration>   \n    ```  \n  \n     This example configures the endpoint that the client uses to access the service that is located at the following address: http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service/CalculatorService  \n  \n     The endpoint element specifies that the `ServiceReference1.ICalculator` service contract is used for communication between the WCF client and service. The WCF channel is configured with the system-provided <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`>. This contract was generated by using Add Service Reference in Visual Studio. It is essentially a copy of the contract that was defined in the GettingStartedLib project. The <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> binding specifies HTTP as the transport, interoperable security, and other configuration details.  \n  \n2.
