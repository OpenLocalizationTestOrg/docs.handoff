For example, unsafe code that uses arrays as buffers might be susceptible to buffer overruns if it is written on the assumption that arrays will not exceed 2 GB.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to enable this feature for an application.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n  <runtime>  \n    <gcAllowVeryLargeObjects enabled=\"true\" />  \n  </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Runtime Settings Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md)\n- [Configuration File Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,257],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"gcAllowVeryLargeObjects element\"\n  - \"<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> element\"\nms.assetid: 5c7ea24a-39ac-4e5f-83b7-b9f9a1b556ab\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;gcAllowVeryLargeObjects&gt;</ph> Element","source":"<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[264,298],"content":"\\<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element","linkify":"\\<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>gcAllowVeryLargeObjects&gt; Element","pos":[0,34],"source":"\\<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element"}]},{"content":"On 64-bit platforms, enables arrays that are greater than 2 gigabytes (GB) in total size.","pos":[299,388]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>configuration&gt; Element","pos":[395,419],"source":"\\<configuration> Element"},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>runtime&gt; Element","pos":[422,440],"source":"\\<runtime> Element"},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>gcAllowVeryLargeObjects&gt; Element","pos":[443,477],"source":"\\<gcAllowVeryLargeObjects> Element"},{"pos":[486,492],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[577,600],"content":"Attributes and Elements","linkify":"Attributes and Elements","nodes":[{"content":"Attributes and Elements","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.","pos":[604,684]},{"pos":[694,704],"content":"Attributes","linkify":"Attributes","nodes":[{"content":"Attributes","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"Attribute","pos":[711,720]},{"content":"Description","pos":[721,732]},{"content":"Required attribute.","pos":[785,804]},{"content":"Specifies whether arrays that are greater than 2 GB in total size are enabled on 64-bit platforms.","pos":[817,915]},{"pos":[925,942],"content":"enabled Attribute","linkify":"enabled Attribute","nodes":[{"content":"enabled Attribute","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Value","pos":[949,954]},{"content":"Description","pos":[955,966]},{"content":"Arrays greater than 2 GB in total size are not enabled.","pos":[1013,1068]},{"content":"This is the default.","pos":[1069,1089]},{"content":"Arrays greater than 2 GB in total size are enabled on 64-bit platforms.","pos":[1101,1172]},{"pos":[1183,1197],"content":"Child Elements","linkify":"Child Elements","nodes":[{"content":"Child Elements","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"None.","pos":[1201,1206]},{"pos":[1216,1231],"content":"Parent Elements","linkify":"Parent Elements","nodes":[{"content":"Parent Elements","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Element","pos":[1238,1245]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1246,1257]},{"content":"The root element in every configuration file used by the common language runtime and .NET Framework applications.","pos":[1314,1427]},{"content":"Contains information about runtime initialization options.","pos":[1442,1500]},{"pos":[1510,1517],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Using this element in your application configuration file enables arrays that are larger than 2 GB in size, but does not change other limits on object size or array size:","pos":[1521,1691]},{"pos":[1701,1806],"content":"The maximum number of elements in an array is <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.UInt32.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>.","source":"The maximum number of elements in an array is <xref:System.UInt32.MaxValue?displayProperty=nameWithType>."},{"content":"The maximum index in any single dimension is 2,147,483,591 (0x7FFFFFC7) for byte arrays and arrays of single-byte structures, and 2,146,435,071 (0X7FEFFFFF) for other types.","pos":[1816,1989]},{"content":"The maximum size for strings and other non-array objects is unchanged.","pos":[1999,2069]},{"pos":[2077,2400],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n Before enabling this feature, ensure that your application does not include unsafe code that assumes that all arrays are smaller than 2 GB in size.
