For more information about serializing data, see [How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md).  \n  \n The class must have a public constructor without parameters.  \n  \n Only public properties and fields are deserialized.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The class being serialized does not have a public, parameterless constructor.  \n  \n-   The data in the file does not represent data from the class to be deserialized.  \n  \n-   The file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Always verify inputs, and never deserialize data from an untrusted source. The re-created object runs on a local computer with the permissions of the code that deserialized it. Verify all inputs before using the data in your application.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter>   \n [How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-write-object-data-to-an-xml-file.md)   \n [Serialization (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)   \n [Visual Basic Programming Guide](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,459],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,73],"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,73]}]}],"pos":[6,82],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
