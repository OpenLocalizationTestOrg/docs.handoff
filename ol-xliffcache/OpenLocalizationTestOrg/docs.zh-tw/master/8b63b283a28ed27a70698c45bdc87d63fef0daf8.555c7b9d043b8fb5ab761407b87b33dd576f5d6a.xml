When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested critical section.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Critical section objects provide synchronization similar to that provided by a mutex object, except that critical sections can be used only by the threads of a single process. `CreateCrst` mirrors the Win32 `InitializeCriticalSection` function.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h
