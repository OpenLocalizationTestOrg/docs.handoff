This is true even when the time zone of the date and time value is clearly identifiable (for example, when the <xref:System.DateTime.Kind%2A> property is set to <xref:System.DateTimeKind>). This topic shows how to perform arithmetic operations on date and time values that belong to a particular time zone. The results of the arithmetic operations will reflect the time zone's adjustment rules.\n\n### To apply adjustment rules to date and time arithmetic\n\n1. Implement some method of closely coupling a date and time value with the time zone to which it belongs. For example, declare a structure that includes both the date and time value and its time zone. The following example uses this approach to link a <xref:System.DateTime> value with its time zone.\n\n   [!code-csharp[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/cs/Conceptual6.cs#6)]\n   [!code-vb[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/vb/Conceptual6.vb#6)]\n\n2. Convert a time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by calling either the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtc%2A> method or the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime%2A> method.\n\n3. Perform the arithmetic operation on the UTC time.\n\n4. Convert the time from UTC to the original time's associated time zone by calling the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime%28System.DateTime%2CSystem.TimeZoneInfo%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example adds two hours and thirty minutes to March 9, 2008, at 1:30 A.M. Central Standard Time. The time zone's transition to daylight saving time occurs thirty minutes later, at 2:00 A.M. on March 9, 2008. Because the example follows the four steps listed in the previous section, it correctly reports the resulting time as 5:00 A.M. on March 9, 2008.\n\n[!code-csharp[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/cs/Conceptual8.cs#8)]\n[!code-vb[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/vb/Conceptual8.vb#8)]\n\nBoth <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values are disassociated from any time zone to which they might belong. To perform date and time arithmetic in a way that automatically applies a time zone's adjustment rules, the time zone to which any date and time value belongs must be immediately identifiable. This means that a date and time and its associated time zone must be tightly coupled. There are several ways to do this, which include the following:\n\n* Assume that all times used in an application belong to a particular time zone. Although appropriate in some cases, this approach offers limited flexibility and possibly limited portability.\n\n* Define a type that tightly couples a date and time with its associated time zone by including both as fields of the type. This approach is used in the code example, which defines a structure to store the date and time and the time zone in two member fields.\n\nThe example illustrates how to perform arithmetic operations on <xref:System.DateTime> values so that time zone adjustment rules are applied to the result. However, <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values can be used just as easily. The following example illustrates how the code in the original example might be adapted to use <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> instead of <xref:System.DateTime> values.\n\n[!code-csharp[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/cs/Conceptual6.cs#7)]\n[!code-vb[System.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.DateTimeOffset.Conceptual/vb/Conceptual6.vb#7)]\n\nNote that if this addition is simply performed on the <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> value without first converting it to UTC, the result reflects the correct point in time but its offset does not reflect that of the designated time zone for that time.\n\n## Compiling the code\n\nThis example requires:\n\n* That a reference to System.Core.dll be added to the project.\n\n* That the <xref:System> namespace be imported with the `using` statement (required in C# code).\n\n## See also\n\n[Dates, times, and time zones](../../../docs/standard/datetime/index.md)\n[Performing arithmetic operations
