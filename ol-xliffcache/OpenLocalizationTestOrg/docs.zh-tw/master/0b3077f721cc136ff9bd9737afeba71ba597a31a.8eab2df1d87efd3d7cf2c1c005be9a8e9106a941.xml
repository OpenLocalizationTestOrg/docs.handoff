This guide describes all the major elements of programming with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/program-structure-and-code-conventions.md)  \n Contains documentation on the basic structure and code conventions of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], such as naming conventions, comments in code, and limitations within [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n [Visual Basic Language Features](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/index.md)  \n Provides links to topics that introduce and discuss important features of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], including LINQ and XML literals.  \n  \n [COM Interop](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/index.md)  \n Explains the interoperability issues associated with creating and using component object model (COM) objects with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Visual Basic Language Reference](../../visual-basic/language-reference/index.md)  \n Provides reference information about various aspects of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] programming.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)  \n Offers information on using the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] command-line compiler, the compiler options, and the Keyword Upgrade tool.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"Visual Basic Programming Guide | Microsoft
