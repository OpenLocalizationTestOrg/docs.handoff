To change the cap at the beginning of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeStartLineCap%2A> property. To change the cap at the end of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeEndLineCap%2A> property. To view the available line caps, see the <xref:System.Windows.Media.PenLineCap> enumeration.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This property only affects an open shape, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, or an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> element.  \n  \n The following example draws four <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> elements and uses a different set of shapes on the ends of each.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[drawingwithshapeelements#ShapeLineCaps1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/linecapsandjoinsexample.xaml#shapelinecaps1)]  \n  \n This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.PenLineCap>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,259],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Shape elements [WPF], ends\"\n  - \"Shape elements [WPF], caps\"\n  - \"graphics [WPF], Shape caps\"\nms.assetid: f4bf3416-b3d8-4568-b98e-3eda8f6dbf7a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[266,320],"content":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","linkify":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Modify the Cap at the End of a Line or Segment","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to modify the shape at the start or end of an open <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[321,438],"source":"This example shows how to modify the shape at the start or end of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape> element."},{"content":"To change the cap at the beginning of an open <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape&gt;</ph>, use its <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeStartLineCap%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[439,595],"source":" To change the cap at the beginning of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeStartLineCap%2A> property."},{"content":"To change the cap at the end of an open <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape&gt;</ph>, use its <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeEndLineCap%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[596,744],"source":" To change the cap at the end of an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>, use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeEndLineCap%2A> property."},{"content":"To view the available line caps, see the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.PenLineCap&gt;</ph> enumeration.","pos":[745,837],"source":" To view the available line caps, see the <xref:System.Windows.Media.PenLineCap> enumeration."},{"pos":[845,1037],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This property only affects an open shape, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, or an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> element.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"This property only affects an open shape, such as a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph>, a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline&gt;</ph>, or an open <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[9,190],"source":"This property only affects an open shape, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>, a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>, or an open <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Path> element."}]},{"pos":[1044,1179],"content":"The following example draws four <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline&gt;</ph> elements and uses a different set of shapes on the ends of each.","source":"The following example draws four <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> elements and uses a different set of shapes on the ends of each."},{"pos":[1188,1195],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1374,1516],"content":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>.","source":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)."},{"pos":[1525,1533],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
