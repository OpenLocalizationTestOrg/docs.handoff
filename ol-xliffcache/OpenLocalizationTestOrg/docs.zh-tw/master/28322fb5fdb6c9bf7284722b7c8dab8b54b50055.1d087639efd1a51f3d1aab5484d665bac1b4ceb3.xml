This method also includes several overloads that provide a `culture` parameter that lets you specify the culture to use, and a `comparisonType` parameter that lets you specify the comparison rules to use. Calling these methods instead of the default overload removes any ambiguity about the rules used in a particular method call, and makes it clear whether a particular comparison is culture-sensitive or culture-insensitive.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Both overloads of the <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method perform culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons; you cannot use this method to perform culture-insensitive comparisons. For code clarity, we recommend that you use the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method instead.  \n  \n For culture-sensitive operations, specify the <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value as the `comparisonType` parameter. If you want to perform a culture-sensitive comparison using a designated culture other than the current culture, specify the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents that culture as the `culture` parameter.  \n  \n The culture-insensitive string comparisons supported by the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method are either linguistic (based on the sorting conventions of the invariant culture) or non-linguistic (based on the ordinal value of the characters in the string). Most culture-insensitive string comparisons are non-linguistic. For these comparisons, specify the <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration value as the `comparisonType` parameter. For example, if a security decision (such as a user name or password comparison) is based on the result of a string comparison, the operation should be culture-insensitive and non-linguistic to ensure that the result is not affected by the conventions of a particular culture or language.  \n  \n Use culture-insensitive linguistic string comparison if you want to handle linguistically relevant strings from multiple cultures in a consistent way. For example, if your application displays words that use multiple character sets in a list box, you might want to display words in the same order regardless of the current culture. For culture-insensitive linguistic comparisons, the .NET Framework defines an invariant culture that is based on the linguistic conventions of English. To perform a culture-insensitive linguistic comparison, specify <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.StringComparison?displayProperty=fullName> as the `comparisonType` parameter.  \n  \n The following example performs two culture-insensitive, non-linguistic string comparisons. The first is case-sensitive, but the second is not.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Strings.CultureInsensitiveComparison#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.strings.cultureinsensitivecomparison/cs/cultureinsensitive1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Strings.CultureInsensitiveComparison#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.strings.cultureinsensitivecomparison/vb/cultureinsensitive1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [Performing Culture-Insensitive String Operations](../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/performing-culture-insensitive-string-operations.md)   \n [Best Practices for Using Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,78],"content":"Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]},{"pos":[635,684],"content":"Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons","linkify":"Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons","nodes":[{"content":"Performing Culture-Insensitive String Comparisons","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"By default, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> method performs culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons.","pos":[685,823],"source":"By default, the <xref:System.String.Compare%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method performs culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons."},{"content":"This method also includes several overloads that provide a <ph id=\"ph1\">`culture`</ph> parameter that lets you specify the culture to use, and a <ph id=\"ph2\">`comparisonType`</ph> parameter that lets you specify the comparison rules to use.","pos":[824,1028],"source":" This method also includes several overloads that provide a `culture` parameter that lets you specify the culture to use, and a `comparisonType` parameter that lets you specify the comparison rules to use."},{"content":"Calling these methods instead of the default overload removes any ambiguity about the rules used in a particular method call, and makes it clear whether a particular comparison is culture-sensitive or culture-insensitive.","pos":[1029,1250]},{"pos":[1258,1606],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Both overloads of the <xref:System.String.CompareTo%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method perform culture-sensitive and case-sensitive comparisons; you cannot use this method to perform culture-insensitive comparisons.
