Create a delegate named `MySubDelegate`.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Delegate Sub MySubDelegate(ByVal x As Integer)  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Class class1  \n        Sub Sub1(ByVal x As Integer)  \n            MsgBox(\"The value of x is: \" & CStr(x))  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in `Invoke` method.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Protected Sub DelegateTest()  \n        Dim c1 As New class1  \n        ' Create an instance of the delegate.  \n        Dim msd As MySubDelegate = AddressOf c1.Sub1  \n        ' Call the method.  \n        msd.Invoke(10)  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Delegate Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)\n- [Delegates](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)\n- [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)\n- [Multithreaded Applications](../../../../standard/threading/using-threads-and-threading.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,129],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: b56866ae-abf9-4a5a-a855-486359455e9c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[136,183],"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to associate a method with a delegate and then invoke that method through the delegate.","pos":[184,294]},{"pos":[304,347],"content":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","linkify":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","nodes":[{"content":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","pos":[0,43]}]},{"pos":[357,397],"content":"Create a delegate named <ph id=\"ph1\">`MySubDelegate`</ph>.","source":"Create a delegate named `MySubDelegate`."},{"content":"Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.","pos":[483,562]},{"pos":[741,890],"content":"Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in <ph id=\"ph1\">`Invoke`</ph> method.","source":"Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in `Invoke` method."},{"pos":[1159,1167],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1171,1269],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Delegate Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1272,1364],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegates<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Delegates](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)"},{"pos":[1367,1453],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)"},{"pos":[1456,1547],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Multithreaded Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../standard/threading/using-threads-and-threading.md)</ept>","source":"[Multithreaded Applications](../../../../standard/threading/using-threads-and-threading.md)"}]}
