The following example removes the binding from the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextProperty> of *mytext*, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CodeOnlyBinding#ClearBinding](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CodeOnlyBinding/CSharp/binding.cs#clearbinding)]\n [!code-vb[CodeOnlyBinding#ClearBinding](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CodeOnlyBinding/VisualBasic/App.vb#clearbinding)]  \n  \n Clearing the binding removes the binding so that the value of the dependency property is changed to whatever it would have been without the binding. This value could be a default value, an inherited value, or a value from a data template binding.  \n  \n To clear bindings from all possible properties on an object, use <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations.ClearAllBindings%2A>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations>\n- [Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,267],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Clear Bindings\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"bindings [WPF], clearing\"\n  - \"clearing bindings [WPF]\"\n  - \"data binding [WPF], clearing bindings\"\nms.assetid: 73962a93-32a9-4bcd-9240-bcfbb239093a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Clear Bindings","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"How to: Clear Bindings","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Clear Bindings","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[274,296],"content":"How to: Clear Bindings","linkify":"How to: Clear Bindings","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Clear Bindings","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to clear bindings from an object.","pos":[297,353]},{"pos":[362,369],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"To clear a binding from an individual property on an object, call <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations.ClearBinding%2A&gt;</ph> as shown in the following example.","pos":[373,534],"source":"To clear a binding from an individual property on an object, call <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations.ClearBinding%2A> as shown in the following example."},{"content":"The following example removes the binding from the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextProperty&gt;</ph> of <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>mytext<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[535,703],"source":" The following example removes the binding from the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextProperty> of *mytext*, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> object."},{"content":"Clearing the binding removes the binding so that the value of the dependency property is changed to whatever it would have been without the binding.","pos":[989,1137]},{"content":"This value could be a default value, an inherited value, or a value from a data template binding.","pos":[1138,1235]},{"pos":[1242,1372],"content":"To clear bindings from all possible properties on an object, use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations.ClearAllBindings%2A&gt;</ph>.","source":"To clear bindings from all possible properties on an object, use <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingOperations.ClearAllBindings%2A>."},{"pos":[1381,1389],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1440,1489],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Data Binding Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](data-binding-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)"},{"pos":[1492,1538],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)"}]}
