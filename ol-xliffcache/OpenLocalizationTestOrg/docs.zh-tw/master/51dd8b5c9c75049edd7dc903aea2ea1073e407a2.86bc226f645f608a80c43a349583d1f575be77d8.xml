In the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], CAS policy must be enabled.  \n  \n CAS policy is version-specific. Custom CAS policies that exist in earlier versions of the .NET Framework must be respecified in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)].  \n  \n Applying the `<NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy>` element to a [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)] assembly does not affect [security-transparent code](../../../../../docs/framework/misc/security-transparent-code.md); the transparency rules still apply.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Applying the `<NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy>` element can result in significant performance penalties for native image assemblies created by the [Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator.md) that are not installed in the [global assembly cache](../../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/gac.md). The performance degradation is caused by the inability of the runtime to load the assemblies as native images when the attribute is applied, resulting in their being loaded as just-in-time assemblies.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you specify a target .NET Framework version that is earlier than the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] in the project settings for your Visual Studio project, CAS policy will be enabled, including any custom CAS policies you specified for that version. However, you will not be able to use new [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] types and members. You can also specify an earlier version of the .NET Framework by using the [\\<supportedRuntime> element](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/startup/supportedruntime-element.md) in the startup settings schema in your [application configuration file](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Configuration file syntax is case-sensitive.
