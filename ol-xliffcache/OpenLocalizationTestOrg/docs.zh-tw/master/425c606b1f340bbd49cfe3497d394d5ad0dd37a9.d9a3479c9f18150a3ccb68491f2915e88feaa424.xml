Therefore, debuggers should not build any functionality requiring specific MDA patterns.  \n  \n MDAs may be queued and fired shortly after the MDA is encountered. This could happen if the runtime needs to wait until it reaches a safe point for firing the MDA, instead of firing the MDA when it encounters it. It also means that the runtime may fire a number of MDAs in a single set of queued callbacks (similar to an \"attach\" event operation).  \n  \n A debugger should release the reference to an `ICorDebugMDA` instance immediately after returning from the `MDANotification` callback, to allow the CLR to recycle the memory consumed by an MDA. Releasing the instance may improve performance if many MDAs are firing.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
