The `AddressOf` operator returns a delegate object when applied to a procedure name.  \n  \n This example has a procedure with a delegate parameter that can take a reference to another procedure, obtained with the `AddressOf` operator.  \n  \n### Create the delegate and matching procedures  \n  \n1.  Create a delegate named `MathOperator`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#1](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_1.vb)]  \n  \n2.  Create a procedure named `AddNumbers` with parameters and return value that match those of `MathOperator`, so that the signatures match.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#2](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_2.vb)]  \n  \n3.  Create a procedure named `SubtractNumbers` with a signature that matches `MathOperator`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#3](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_3.vb)]  \n  \n4.  Create a procedure named `DelegateTest` that takes a delegate as a parameter.  \n  \n     This procedure can accept a reference to `AddNumbers` or `SubtractNumbers`, because their signatures match the `MathOperator` signature.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#4](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_4.vb)]  \n  \n5.  Create a procedure named `Test` that calls `DelegateTest` once with the delegate for `AddNumbers` as a parameter, and again with the delegate for `SubtractNumbers` as a parameter.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrDelegates#5](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-pass-procedures-to-another-procedure_5.vb)]  \n  \n     When `Test` is called, it first displays the result of `AddNumbers` acting on `5` and `3`, which is 8. Then the result of `SubtractNumbers` acting on `9` and `3` is displayed, which is 6.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Delegates](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)
