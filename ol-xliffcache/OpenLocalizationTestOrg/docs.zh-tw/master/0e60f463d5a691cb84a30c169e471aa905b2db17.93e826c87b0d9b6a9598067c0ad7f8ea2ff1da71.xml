In addition, the runtime and the .NET provide useful classes and services that facilitate the use of cryptography and role-based security.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n\n [Key Security Concepts](../../../docs/standard/security/key-security-concepts.md)  \n Provides an overview of common language runtime security features.
