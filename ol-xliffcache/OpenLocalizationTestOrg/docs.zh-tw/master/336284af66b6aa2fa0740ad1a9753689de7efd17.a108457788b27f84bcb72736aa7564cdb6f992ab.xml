Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property. You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code.  \n  \n### To disable a menu item programmatically  \n  \n-   Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MenuItem1.Enabled = False  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    menuItem1.Enabled = false;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    menuItem1->Enabled = false;  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  Disabling the first or top-level menu item in a menu hides all the menu items contained within the menu, but does not disable them. Likewise, disabling a menu item that has submenu items hides the submenu items, but does not disable them. If all the commands on a given menu are unavailable to the user, it is considered good programming practice to both hide and disable the entire menu, as this presents a clean user interface. You should hide and disable the menu, and disable every item and submenu item in the menu, because hiding alone does not prevent access to a menu command via a shortcut key. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.Visible%2A> property of a top-level menu item to `false` to hide the entire menu.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem>   \n [How to: Hide ToolStripMenuItems](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-hide-toolstripmenuitems.md)   \n [MenuStrip Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/menustrip-control-overview-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,63],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,51]}]},{"pos":[610,644],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","linkify":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"You can limit or broaden the commands a user may make by enabling and disabling menu items in response to user activities.","pos":[645,767]},{"content":"Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[768,928],"source":" Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property."},{"content":"You can manipulate this property at design time in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window or programmatically by setting it in code.","pos":[929,1048],"source":" You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code."},{"pos":[1058,1097],"content":"To disable a menu item programmatically","linkify":"To disable a menu item programmatically","nodes":[{"content":"To disable a menu item programmatically","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[1107,1269],"content":"Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","source":"Within the method where you set the properties of the menu item, add code to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property to `false`."},{"pos":[1460,2208],"content":"[!TIP]\nDisabling the first or top-level menu item in a menu hides all the menu items contained within the menu, but does not disable them.
