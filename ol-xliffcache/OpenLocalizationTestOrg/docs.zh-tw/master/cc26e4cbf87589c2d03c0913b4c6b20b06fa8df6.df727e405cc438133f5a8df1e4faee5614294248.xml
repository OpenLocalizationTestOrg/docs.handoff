The three destination points determine an affine transformation that maps the original rectangular image to a parallelogram.  \n  \n## Example  \n For example, suppose the original image is a rectangle with upper-left corner at (0, 0), upper-right corner at (100, 0), and lower-left corner at (0, 50). Now suppose you map those three points to destination points as follows.  \n  \n|Original point|Destination point|  \n|--------------------|-----------------------|  \n|Upper-left (0, 0)|(200, 20)|  \n|Upper-right (100, 0)|(110, 100)|  \n|Lower-left (0, 50)|(250, 30)|  \n  \n The following illustration shows the original image and the image mapped to the parallelogram. The original image has been skewed, reflected, rotated, and translated. The x-axis along the top edge of the original image is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (110, 100). The y-axis along the left edge of the original image is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (250, 30).  \n  \n ![Stripes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/stripes1.gif \"Stripes1\")  \n  \n The following illustration shows a similar transformation applied to a photographic image.  \n  \n ![Transformed Climber](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/transformedclimber.png \"TransformedClimber\")  \n  \n The following illustration shows a similar transformation applied to a metafile.  \n  \n ![Transformed Metafile](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/transformedmetafile.png \"TransformedMetafile\")  \n  \n The following example produces the images shown in the first illustration.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#61](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/CS/Class1.cs#61)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#61](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/VB/Class1.vb#61)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler. Make sure to replace `Stripes.bmp` with the path to an image that is valid on your system.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and
