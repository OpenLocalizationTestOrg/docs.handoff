Without bindings, using custom channels requires programming at the channel level as described in [Service Channel-Level Programming](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/service-channel-level-programming.md) and [Client Channel-Level Programming](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/client-channel-level-programming.md). This topic discusses the minimum requirement to enable using your channel in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], the development of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> for your channel, and enable use from the application as described in step 4 of [Developing Channels](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/developing-channels.md).  \n  \n## Overview  \n Creating a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> for your channel enables developers to use it in an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> objects can be used from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost?displayProperty=fullName> class to connect an [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application to your channel without having to the precise type information of your channel.  \n  \n Once a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> has been created, you can enable more functionality depending upon your requirements by following the remaining channel development steps described in [Developing Channels](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/developing-channels.md).  \n  \n## Adding a Binding Element  \n To implement a custom <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement>, write a class that inherits from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement>. For example, if you have developed a `ChunkingChannel` that can break up large messages into chunks and reassemble them on the other end, you can use this channel in any binding by implementing a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> and configuring the binding to use it. The remainder of this topic uses the `ChunkingChannel` as an example to demonstrate the requirements of implementing a binding element.  \n  \n A `ChunkingBindingElement` is responsible for creating the `ChunkingChannelFactory` and `ChunkingChannelListener`. It overrides <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.CanBuildChannelFactory%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.CanBuildChannelListener%2A> implementations, and checks that the type parameter is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IDuplexSessionChannel> (in our example this is the only channel shape supported by the `ChunkingChannel`) and that the other binding elements in the binding support this channel shape.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.BuildChannelFactory%2A> first checks that the requested channel shape can be built and then gets a list of message actions to be chunked. It then creates a new `ChunkingChannelFactory`, passing it the inner channel factory. (If you are creating a transport binding element, that element is the last one in the binding stack and therefore must create a channel listener or channel factory.)  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.BuildChannelListener%2A> has a similar implementation for creating `ChunkingChannelListener` and passing it the inner channel listener.  \n  \n As another example using a transport channel, the [Transport: UDP](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transport-udp.md) sample provides the following override.  \n  \n In the sample, the binding element is `UdpTransportBindingElement`, which derives from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement>. It overrides the following methods to build the factories associated with the channel.  \n  \n```  \npublic IChannelFactory<TChannel> BuildChannelFactory<TChannel>(BindingContext context)  \n{  \n            return (IChannelFactory<TChannel>)(object)new UdpChannelFactory(this, context);  \n}  \n  \npublic IChannelListener<TChannel> BuildChannelListener<TChannel>(BindingContext context)  \n{  \n            return (IChannelListener<TChannel>)(object)new UdpChannelListener(this, context);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n It also contains members for cloning the `BindingElement` and returning our scheme (soap.udp).  \n  \n#### Protocol Binding Elements  \n New binding elements can replace or augment any of the included binding elements, adding new transports, encodings, or higher-level protocols. To create a new Protocol Binding Element, start by extending the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> class. At a minimum, you must then implement the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and implement the `ChannelProtectionRequirements` using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannel.GetProperty%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. This returns the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.ChannelProtectionRequirements> for this binding element.  For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.ChannelProtectionRequirements>.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A> should return a fresh copy of this binding element. As a best practice, we recommend that binding element authors implement <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A> by using a copy constructor that calls the base copy constructor, then clones any additional fields in this class.  \n  \n#### Transport Binding Elements  \n To create a new Transport Binding Element, extend the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement> interface. At a minimum, you must then implement the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A> method and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement.Scheme%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A> – Should return a fresh copy of this Binding Element.  As a best practice, we recommend that Binding Element authors implement Clone by way of a copy constructor that calls the base copy constructor, then clones any additional fields in this class.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement.Scheme%2A> – The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement.Scheme%2A> get property returns the URI scheme for the transport protocol represented by the binding element. For example, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement?displayProperty=fullName> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TcpTransportBindingElement?displayProperty=fullName> return \"http\" and \"net.tcp\" from their respective <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportBindingElement.Scheme%2A> properties.  \n  \n#### Encoding Binding Elements  \n To create new Encoding Binding Elements, start by extending the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> class and implementing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement?displayProperty=fullName> class. At a minimum, you must then implement the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement.CreateMessageEncoderFactory%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement.MessageVersion%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A>. Returns a fresh copy of this binding element. As a best practice, we recommend that binding element authors implement <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement.Clone%2A> by using a copy constructor that calls the base copy constructor, then clones any additional fields in this class.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement.CreateMessageEncoderFactory%2A>. Returns a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncoderFactory>, which provides a handle to the actual class that implements your new encoder and which should extend <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncoder>. For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncoderFactory> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncoder>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement.MessageVersion%2A>. Returns the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageVersion> used in this encoding, which represents the versions of SOAP and WS-Addressing in use.  \n  \n For a complete listing of optional methods and properties for user-defined encoding binding elements, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageEncodingBindingElement>.  \n  \n For more information on creating a new binding element, see [Creating User-Defined Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/creating-user-defined-bindings.md).  \n  \n Once you have created a binding element for your channel, return to the [Developing Channels](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/developing-channels.md) topic to see whether you want to add configuration file support to your binding element, if and how to add metadata publication support, and whether and how to construct a user-defined binding that uses your binding element.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement>   \n
