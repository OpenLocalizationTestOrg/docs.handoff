This parameter is specified in many of the constructors for `FileStream` and `IsolatedStorageFileStream`, and for the `Open` methods of <xref:System.IO.File> and <xref:System.IO.FileInfo>.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.FileShare?displayProperty=fullName>|Defines constants for controlling the type of access other file streams can have to the same file.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Path?displayProperty=fullName>|Provides methods and properties for processing directory strings.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission?displayProperty=fullName>|Controls the access of files and folders by defining <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermissionAttribute.Read%2A>, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermissionAttribute.Write%2A>, <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermissionAttribute.Append%2A> and <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermissionAttribute.PathDiscovery%2A> permissions.|  \n  \n## Classes Used to Create Streams  \n The following table lists and describes the main classes used to create streams.  \n  \n|Class|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.IO.BufferedStream?displayProperty=fullName>|Adds a buffering layer to read and write operations on another stream.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.FileStream?displayProperty=fullName>|Supports random access to files through its <xref:System.IO.FileStream.Seek%2A> method. <xref:System.IO.FileStream> opens files synchronously by default but also supports asynchronous operation.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.MemoryStream?displayProperty=fullName>|Creates a stream whose backing store is memory, rather than a file.|  \n|<xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream?displayProperty=fullName>|Provides the underlying stream of data for network access.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream?displayProperty=fullName>|Defines a stream that links data streams to cryptographic transformations.|  \n  \n## Classes Used to Read from and Write to Streams  \n The following table shows the specific classes used for reading from and writing to files with streams.  \n  \n|**Class**|**Description**|  \n|---------------|---------------------|  \n|<xref:System.IO.BinaryReader?displayProperty=fullName>|Reads encoded strings and primitive data types from a <xref:System.IO.FileStream>.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter?displayProperty=fullName>|Writes encoded strings and primitive data types to a <xref:System.IO.FileStream>.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.StreamReader?displayProperty=fullName>|Reads characters from a <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, using <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.CurrentEncoding%2A> to convert characters to and from bytes. <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> has a constructor that attempts to ascertain the correct <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.CurrentEncoding%2A> for a given stream, based on the presence of a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.CurrentEncoding%2A>-specific preamble, such as a byte order mark.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.StreamWriter?displayProperty=fullName>|Writes characters to a `FileStream`, using <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter.Encoding%2A> to convert characters to bytes.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.StringReader?displayProperty=fullName>|Reads characters from a `String`. Output can be either a stream in any encoding or a `String`.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.StringWriter?displayProperty=fullName>|Writes characters to a `String`.
