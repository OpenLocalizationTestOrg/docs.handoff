For example, Microsoft Word documents contain an icon that identifies them as Word documents. When displaying files in a list control or table control, you may want to display the icon representing the file type next to each file name. You can do this easily by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to extract the icon associated with a file and display the file name and its associated icon in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To compile the example:  \n  \n-   Paste the preceding code into a Windows Form, and call the `ExtractAssociatedIconExample` method from the form's constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event-handling method.  \n  \n     You will need to make sure that your form imports the <xref:System.IO> namespace.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)   \n [ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/listview-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,676],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,81]}]}],"pos":[6,90],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
