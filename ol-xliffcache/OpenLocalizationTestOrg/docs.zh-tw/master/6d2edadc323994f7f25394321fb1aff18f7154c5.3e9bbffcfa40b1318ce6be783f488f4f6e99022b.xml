The common language runtime cannot box certain structure types, for example <xref:System.ArgIterator>, <xref:System.RuntimeArgumentHandle>, and <xref:System.TypedReference>.  \n  \n This expression attempts to use the restricted type to call a method inherited from <xref:System.Object> or <xref:System.ValueType>, such as <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A> or <xref:System.Object.ToString%2A>. To access this method, Visual Basic has attempted an implicit boxing conversion that causes this error.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31393  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Locate the expression that evaluates to the cited type.  \n  \n2.  Locate the part of your statement that attempts to call the method inherited from <xref:System.Object> or <xref:System.ValueType>.  \n  \n3.  Rewrite the statement to avoid the method call.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,300],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Expression has the type '<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31393\"\n  - \"vbc31393\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31393\"\nms.assetid: 2963cf3f-c527-4aa7-b67c-ee80b6d23186","nodes":[{"content":"Expression has the type '<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,139],"content":"Expression has the type '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;typename&gt;</ph>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'","source":"Expression has the type '<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[307,447],"content":"Expression has the type '\\<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'","linkify":"Expression has the type '\\<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'","nodes":[{"content":"Expression has the type '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>typename&gt;' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'","pos":[0,140],"source":"Expression has the type '\\<typename>' which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from 'Object' or 'ValueType'"}]},{"content":"An expression evaluates to a type that cannot be boxed by the common language runtime (CLR) but accesses a member that requires boxing.","pos":[448,583]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Boxing<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> refers to the processing necessary to convert a type to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Object`</ph> or, on occasion, to <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ValueType&gt;</ph>.","pos":[590,708],"source":"*Boxing* refers to the processing necessary to convert a type to `Object` or, on occasion, to <xref:System.ValueType>."},{"content":"The common language runtime cannot box certain structure types, for example <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ArgIterator&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.RuntimeArgumentHandle&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.TypedReference&gt;</ph>.","pos":[709,882],"source":" The common language runtime cannot box certain structure types, for example <xref:System.ArgIterator>, <xref:System.RuntimeArgumentHandle>, and <xref:System.TypedReference>."},{"content":"This expression attempts to use the restricted type to call a method inherited from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Object&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ValueType&gt;</ph>, such as <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Object.ToString%2A&gt;</ph>.","pos":[889,1102],"source":"This expression attempts to use the restricted type to call a method inherited from <xref:System.Object> or <xref:System.ValueType>, such as <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A> or <xref:System.Object.ToString%2A>."},{"content":"To access this method, Visual Basic has attempted an implicit boxing conversion that causes this error.","pos":[1103,1206]},{"pos":[1213,1234],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31393","source":"**Error ID:** BC31393"},{"pos":[1243,1264],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Locate the expression that evaluates to the cited type.","pos":[1274,1329]},{"pos":[1339,1469],"content":"Locate the part of your statement that attempts to call the method inherited from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Object&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ValueType&gt;</ph>.","source":"Locate the part of your statement that attempts to call the method inherited from <xref:System.Object> or <xref:System.ValueType>."},{"content":"Rewrite the statement to avoid the method call.","pos":[1479,1526]},{"pos":[1535,1543],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1547,1689],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Implicit and Explicit Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)</ept>","source":"[Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)"}]}
