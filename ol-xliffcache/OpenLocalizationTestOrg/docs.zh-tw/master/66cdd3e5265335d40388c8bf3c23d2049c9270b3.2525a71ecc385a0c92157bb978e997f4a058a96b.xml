References to `Me` or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a `Structure`.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36535  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to `Me` and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nStructure SampleStructure  \n    Public SearchValue As Integer  \n  \n    Public Sub SetSearchValue(ByVal number As Integer)  \n      SearchValue = number  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public Sub GetData()  \n        Dim sv = SearchValue  \n        Dim SampleData = New Integer() {1, 2, 3, 4}  \n        Dim query = From number In SampleData _  \n                    Where number < sv  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Structure  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)   \n [LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)   \n [Me](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2)   \n [Structure (Visual Basic)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/263ce115-ac36-4c05-8cb7-0e0eead5c6d0)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,99],"content":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used in a query expression | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; cannot be used in a query expression | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,87],"source":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used in a query expression | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[615,685],"content":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used in a query expression","linkify":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used in a query expression","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; cannot be used in a query expression","pos":[0,70],"source":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used in a query expression"}]},{"content":"A LINQ query in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Structure`</ph> includes a reference to <ph id=\"ph2\">`Me`</ph> or to an instance member of the structure.","pos":[686,787],"source":"A LINQ query in a `Structure` includes a reference to `Me` or to an instance member of the structure."},{"content":"References to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph> or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Structure`</ph>.","pos":[788,885],"source":" References to `Me` or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a `Structure`."},{"pos":[892,913],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36535","source":"**Error ID:** BC36535"},{"pos":[922,943],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[953,1113],"content":"Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph> and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example.","source":"Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to `Me` and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[1541,1549],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1553,1677],"source":"[Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>LINQ<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1680,1758],"source":" [LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1761,1837],"source":" [Me](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Structure (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/263ce115-ac36-4c05-8cb7-0e0eead5c6d0)</ept>","pos":[1840,1937],"source":" [Structure (Visual Basic)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/263ce115-ac36-4c05-8cb7-0e0eead5c6d0)"}]}
