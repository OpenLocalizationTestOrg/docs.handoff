This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WF\\Application\\PurchaseProcess`  \n  \n## Description of the Process  \n This sample shows an implementation of a [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] program to gather proposals from vendors for a generic company.  \n  \n1.  An employee of Company X creates a Request for Proposal (RFP).  \n  \n    1.  The employee types in the RFP title and description.  \n  \n    2.  The employee selects the vendors that he wants to invite to submit proposals.  \n  \n2.  The employee submits the proposal.  \n  \n    1.  An instance of the workflow is created.  \n  \n    2.  The workflow is waiting for all vendors to submit their proposals.  \n  \n3.  After all proposals are received, the workflow iterates through all the received proposals and selects the best one.  \n  \n    1.  Each vendor has a reputation (this sample stores the reputation list in VendorRepository.cs).  \n  \n    2.  The total value of the proposal is determined by (The value typed in by the vendor) * (The vendor's recorded reputation) / 100.  \n  \n4.  The original requester can see all the submitted proposals. The best proposal is presented in a special section in the report.  \n  \n## Process Definition  \n The core logic of the sample uses a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601> activity that waits for the offers from each vendor (using a custom activity that creates a bookmark), and registers the vendor proposal as an RFP (using an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.InvokeMethod> activity).  \n  \n The sample then iterates through all of the received proposals stored in the `RfpRepository`, calculating the adjusted value (using an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity and <xref:System.Activities.Expressions> activities), and if the adjusted value is better than the previous best offer, assigns the new value as the best offer (using <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activities).  \n  \n## Projects in this Sample  \n This sample contains the following projects.  \n  \n|Project|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|Common|The entity objects used within the process (Request for Proposal, Vendor, and Vendor Proposal).|  \n|WfDefinition|The definition of the process (as a [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] program) and host (`PurchaseProcessHost`) used by client applications for creating and using instances of the purchase process workflow.|  \n|WebClient|An [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] client application that allows the users to create and participate in instances of the purchase process.
