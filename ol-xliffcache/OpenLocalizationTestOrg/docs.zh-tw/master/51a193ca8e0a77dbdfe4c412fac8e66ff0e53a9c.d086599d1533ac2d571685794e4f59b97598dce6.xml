This property designates where your control resides in the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property can be set to the following values:  \n  \n|Setting|Effect on your control|  \n|-------------|----------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the bottom of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Fills all remaining space in the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the left side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the right side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>|Docks to the top of the form.|  \n  \n These values can also be set in code. For more information, see [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To set the Dock property for your control at design time  \n  \n1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, select your control.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the drop-down box next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property.  \n  \n     A graphical interface representing the six possible <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> settings is displayed.  \n  \n3.  Choose the appropriate setting.  \n  \n4.  Your control will now dock in the manner specified by the setting.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)   \n [How to: Anchor Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)   \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a FlowLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-flowlayoutpanel-control.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a TableLayoutPanel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-tablelayoutpanel.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a FlowLayoutPanel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-flowlayoutpanel.md)   \n [Developing Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/developing-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,89],"content":"How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,77]}]},{"pos":[566,626],"content":"How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time","linkify":"How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"You can make your control align to the edge of your forms by setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A&gt;</ph>.","pos":[627,744],"source":"You can make your control align to the edge of your forms by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A>."},{"content":"This property designates where your control resides in the form.","pos":[745,809]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A&gt;</ph> property can be set to the following values:","pos":[810,902],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property can be set to the following values:"},{"content":"Setting","pos":[909,916]},{"content":"Effect on your control","pos":[917,939]},{"content":"Docks to the bottom of the form.","pos":[1029,1061]},{"content":"Fills all remaining space in the form.","pos":[1104,1142]},{"content":"Docks to the left side of the form.","pos":[1185,1220]},{"content":"Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1263,1383],"source":"Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>."},{"content":"Docks to the right side of the form.","pos":[1426,1462]},{"content":"Docks to the top of the form.","pos":[1505,1534]},{"content":"These values can also be set in code.","pos":[1542,1579]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1580,1748],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1756,2132],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
