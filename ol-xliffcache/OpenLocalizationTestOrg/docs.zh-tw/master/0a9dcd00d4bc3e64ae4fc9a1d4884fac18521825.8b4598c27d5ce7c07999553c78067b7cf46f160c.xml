For example, the Arial font family contains the following fonts:  \n  \n-   Arial Regular  \n  \n-   Arial Bold  \n  \n-   Arial Italic  \n  \n-   Arial Bold Italic  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] uses four styles to form families: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic. Adjectives such as *narrow* and *rounded* are not considered styles; rather they are part of the family name. For example, Arial Narrow is a font family with the following members:  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Regular  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Bold  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Italic  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Bold Italic  \n  \n Before you can draw text with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you need to construct a <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object and a <xref:System.Drawing.Font> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object specifies the typeface (for example, Arial), and the <xref:System.Drawing.Font> object specifies the size, style, and units.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs a regular style Arial font with a size of 16 pixels. In the following code, the first argument passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Font.%23ctor%2A> constructor is the <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object. The second argument specifies the size of the font measured in units identified by the fourth argument. The third argument identifies the style.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.GraphicsUnit.Pixel> is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.GraphicsUnit> enumeration, and <xref:System.Drawing.FontStyle.Regular> is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.FontStyle> enumeration.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.FontsAndText#61](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.FontsAndText/CS/Class1.cs#61)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.FontsAndText#61](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.FontsAndText/VB/Class1.vb#61)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)\n- [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,273],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"font families [Windows Forms], constructing\"\n  - \"fonts [Windows Forms], constructing\"\nms.assetid: d3a4a223-9492-4b54-9afd-db1c31c3cefd","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[280,321],"content":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","linkify":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> groups fonts with the same typeface but different styles into font families.","pos":[322,466],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] groups fonts with the same typeface but different styles into font families."},{"content":"For example, the Arial font family contains the following fonts:","pos":[467,531]},{"content":"Arial Regular","pos":[541,554]},{"content":"Arial Bold","pos":[564,574]},{"content":"Arial Italic","pos":[584,596]},{"content":"Arial Bold Italic","pos":[606,623]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> uses four styles to form families: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic.","pos":[630,772],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] uses four styles to form families: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic."},{"content":"Adjectives such as <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>narrow<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>rounded<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> are not considered styles;
