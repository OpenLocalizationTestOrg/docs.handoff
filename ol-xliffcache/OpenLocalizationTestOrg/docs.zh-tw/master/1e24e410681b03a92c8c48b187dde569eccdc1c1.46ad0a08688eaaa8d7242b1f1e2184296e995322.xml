Whenever the user presses the ENTER key, the default button is clicked regardless of which other control on the form has the focus.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The exceptions to this are when the control with focus is another button — in that case, the button with the focus will be clicked — or a multiline text box, or a custom control that traps the ENTER key.  \n  \n### To designate the accept button  \n  \n1.  Set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub SetDefault(ByVal myDefaultBtn As Button)  \n      Me.AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn   \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void SetDefault(Button myDefaultBtn)  \n    {  \n       this.AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void SetDefault(Button ^ myDefaultBtn)  \n       {  \n          this->AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn;  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A>\n- [Button Control Overview](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control](ways-to-select-a-windows-forms-button-control.md)\n- [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)\n- [How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button](how-to-designate-a-windows-forms-button-as-the-cancel-button.md)\n- [Button Control](button-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,418],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"buttons [Windows Forms], default on Windows Forms\"\n  - \"Accept button on Windows Forms\"\n  - \"Button control [Windows Forms], designating as default\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, default button on form\"\nms.assetid: 22cc9da6-b913-4e04-9554-dee443ac5c3a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[425,486],"content":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","linkify":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"On any Windows Form, you can designate a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button&gt;</ph> control to be the accept button, also known as the default button.","pos":[487,629],"source":"On any Windows Form, you can designate a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control to be the accept button, also known as the default button."},{"content":"Whenever the user presses the ENTER key, the default button is clicked regardless of which other control on the form has the focus.","pos":[630,761]},{"pos":[769,983],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The exceptions to this are when the control with focus is another button — in that case, the button with the focus will be clicked — or a multiline text box, or a custom control that traps the ENTER key.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The exceptions to this are when the control with focus is another button — in that case, the button with the focus will be clicked — or a multiline text box, or a custom control that traps the ENTER key.","pos":[9,212]}]},{"pos":[993,1023],"content":"To designate the accept button","linkify":"To designate the accept button","nodes":[{"content":"To designate the accept button","pos":[0,30]}]},{"pos":[1033,1168],"content":"Set the form's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A&gt;</ph> property to the appropriate <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button&gt;</ph> control.","source":"Set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control."},{"pos":[1612,1620],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1675,1742],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Button Control Overview](button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1745,1842],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control<ept id=\"p1\">](ways-to-select-a-windows-forms-button-control.md)</ept>","source":"[Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control](ways-to-select-a-windows-forms-button-control.md)"},{"pos":[1845,1943],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)"},{"pos":[1946,2074],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-designate-a-windows-forms-button-as-the-cancel-button.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button](how-to-designate-a-windows-forms-button-as-the-cancel-button.md)"},{"pos":[2077,2126],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Control<ept id=\"p1\">](button-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Button Control](button-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
