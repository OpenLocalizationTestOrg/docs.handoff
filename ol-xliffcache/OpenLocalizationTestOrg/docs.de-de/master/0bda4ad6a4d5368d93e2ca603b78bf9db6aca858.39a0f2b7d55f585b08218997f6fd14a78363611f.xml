The third declaration changes `arrayParam` to a two-dimensional array (rank 2). While Visual Basic allows overloads to differ only by one of these changes, such overloading is not compliant with the [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md) (CLS).  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
