Remove the `Overloads` keyword.  \n  \n-   If you wish to replace the base class member instead of defining an additional version of it, use the [Overrides](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md) keyword instead of `Overloads`.  \n  \n-   If you wish to hide the base class member with a new member in the derived class, use the [Shadows](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shadows.md) keyword instead of `Overloads`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Procedure Overloading](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)   \n [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,213],"content":"Member &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39;
