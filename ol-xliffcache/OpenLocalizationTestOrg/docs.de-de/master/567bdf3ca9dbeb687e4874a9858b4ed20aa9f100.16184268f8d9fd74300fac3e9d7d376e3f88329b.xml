Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.  \n  \n A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class. However, the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword was not used. This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0108:  \n  \n```  \n// CS0108.cs  \n// compile with: /W:2  \nusing System;  \n  \nnamespace x  \n{  \n   public class clx  \n   {  \n      public int i = 1;  \n   }  \n  \n   public class cly : clx  \n   {  \n      public static int i = 2;   // CS0108, use the new keyword  \n      // Use the following line instead:  \n      // public static new int i = 2;  \n  \n      public static void Main()  \n      {  \n         Console.WriteLine(i);  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [new Modifier](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md)   \n [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[555,588],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'.","pos":[589,632]},{"content":"Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.","pos":[633,676]},{"content":"A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class.","pos":[683,756]},{"content":"However, the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)</ept> keyword was not used.","pos":[757,849],"source":" However, the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword was not used."},{"content":"This warning informs you that you should use <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>; the variable is declared as if <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>new<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> had been used in the declaration.","pos":[850,976],"source":" This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0108:","pos":[983,1021]},{"pos":[1471,1479],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new Modifier<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1483,1559],"source":"[new Modifier](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)</ept>","pos":[1562,1620],"source":" [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)"}]}
