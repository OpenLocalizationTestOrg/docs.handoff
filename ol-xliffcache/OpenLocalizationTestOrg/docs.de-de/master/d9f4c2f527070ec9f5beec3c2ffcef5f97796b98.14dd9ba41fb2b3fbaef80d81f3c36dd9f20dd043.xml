By using image encoders in [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can write images from memory to disk. By using image decoders in [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can load images from disk into memory. An encoder translates the data in an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> or <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object into a designated disk file format. A decoder translates the data in a disk file to the format required by the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> and <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> objects.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] has built-in encoders and decoders that support the following file types:  \n  \n-   BMP  \n  \n-   GIF  \n  \n-   JPEG  \n  \n-   PNG  \n  \n-   TIFF  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] also has built-in decoders that support the following file types:  \n  \n-   WMF  \n  \n-   EMF  \n  \n-   ICON  \n  \n The following topics discuss encoders and decoders in more detail:  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: List Installed Encoders](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)  \n Describes how to list the encoders available on a computer.  \n  \n [How to: List Installed Decoders](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-list-installed-decoders.md)  \n Describes how to list the decoders available on a computer.  \n  \n [How to: Determine the Parameters Supported by an Encoder](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-determine-the-parameters-supported-by-an-encoder.md)  \n Describes how to list the

image](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-convert-a-bmp-image-to-a-png-image.md)  \n Describes how to save a image in a different image format.  \n  \n [How to: Set JPEG Compression
