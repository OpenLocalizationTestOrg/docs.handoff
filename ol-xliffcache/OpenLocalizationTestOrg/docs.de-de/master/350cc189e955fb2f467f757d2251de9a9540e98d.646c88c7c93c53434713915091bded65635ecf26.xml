is not a procedure, property, or array.  \n  \n The following code can generate this error.  \n  \n `Dim testVariable As Object = Nothing(1)`  \n  \n Because `Nothing` does not take arguments or indexes, you cannot use it with parentheses.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32303  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the parentheses and any value they contain.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to:
