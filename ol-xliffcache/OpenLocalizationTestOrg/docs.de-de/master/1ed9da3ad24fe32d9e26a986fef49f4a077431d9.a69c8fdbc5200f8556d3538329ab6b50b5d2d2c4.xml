For example, the text box may display a value that is usually edited but may not be currently, due to the state of the application.  \n  \n### To create a read-only text box  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`. With the property set to `true`, users can still scroll and highlight text in a text box without allowing changes. A **Copy** command is functional in a text box, but **Cut** and **Paste** commands are not.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property only affects user interaction at run time. You can still change text box contents programmatically at run time by changing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of the text box.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>   \n [TextBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/textbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Control the Insertion Point in a Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-control-the-insertion-point-in-a-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: Create a Password Text Box with the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-password-text-box-with-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-put-quotation-marks-in-a-string-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Select Text in the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-select-text-in-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: View Multiple Lines in the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-view-multiple-lines-in-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/textbox-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,80],"content":"How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[543,594],"content":"How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms)","linkify":"How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"You can transform an editable Windows Forms text box into a read-only control.","pos":[595,673]},{"content":"For example, the text box may display a value that is usually edited but may not be currently, due to the state of the application.","pos":[674,805]},{"pos":[815,845],"content":"To create a read-only text box","linkify":"To create a read-only text box","nodes":[{"content":"To create a read-only text box","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox&gt;</ph> control's <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph3\">`true`</ph>.","pos":[855,980],"source":"Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`."},{"content":"With the property set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph>, users can still scroll and highlight text in a text box without allowing changes.","pos":[981,1095],"source":" With the property set to `true`, users can still scroll and highlight text in a text box without allowing changes."},{"content":"A <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Copy<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> command is functional in a text box, but <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Cut<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> and <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Paste<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> commands are not.","pos":[1096,1187],"source":" A **Copy** command is functional in a text box, but **Cut** and **Paste** commands are not."},{"pos":[1199,1475],"content":"[!NOTE]\nThe <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.ReadOnly%2A> property only affects user interaction at run time.
