Add the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks) to your project and configure your project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n2.

The `Navigate` operator takes the following parameters: an instance of an entity, the relationship type, the end of the relationship, and the beginning of the relationship. Optionally, you can pass only an instance of an entity and the relationship type to the `Navigate` operator.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices
