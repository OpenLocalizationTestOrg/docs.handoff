For example, does an animated property remain at its end value after the animation ends or does it revert back to the value it had before the animation started?  \n  \n The following example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> of two rectangles. Each rectangle uses a different <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> object.  \n  \n One <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> has a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> that is set to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.FillBehavior.Stop>, which causes the width of the rectangle to revert back to its non-animated value when the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> ends. The other <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> has a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.FillBehavior%2A> of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.FillBehavior.HoldEnd>, which causes the width to remain at its end value when the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> ends.  \n  \n
