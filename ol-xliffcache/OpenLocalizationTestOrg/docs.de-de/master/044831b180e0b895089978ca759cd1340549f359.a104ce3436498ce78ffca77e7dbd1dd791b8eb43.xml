Correlation provides the mechanism for this. The topics in this section provide an overview of correlation and how to use it in different workflow service scenarios.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Correlation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md)  \n Provides an overview of the types of correlation available in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n [Context Exchange](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/context-exchange-correlation.md)  \n Describes context exchange correlation.  \n  \n [Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/durable-duplex-correlation.md)  \n Describes durable duplex correlation.  \n  \n [Content Based](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/content-based-correlation.md)  \n Describes content-based correlation.  \n  \n [Request-Reply](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md)  \n Describes request-reply correlation.  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/troubleshooting-correlation.md)  \n Provides methods for troubleshooting correlation.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle>   \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>   \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>   \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.CorrelationQuery>   \n [Content-Based Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/content-based-correlation.md)   \n [Correlated Calculator](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/correlated-calculator.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,332],"nodes":[{"content":"Correlation | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,28],"content":"Correlation | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Correlation | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,28]}]}],"pos":[6,37],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Correlation | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
