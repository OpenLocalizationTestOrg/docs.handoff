This is the appropriate cache behavior for most applications.  \n  \n### To set the default automatic policy for an application  \n  \n1.  Create a default time-based policy object.  \n  \n2.  Set the policy object as the default for the application domain.  \n  \n## Example  \n The two examples in this section produce identical policies.  \n  \n The following example creates a default time-based policy and sets it as the default for the application domain.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic static void SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy ()  \n{  \n    HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy ();  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy ;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Shared Sub SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy ()  \n    Dim policy = New HttpRequestCachePolicy ()  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n You can also create the default time-based cache policy using the <xref:System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy> class as shown in the following example:  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic static void SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy2()  \n{  \n    RequestCachePolicy policy = new RequestCachePolicy ();  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy ;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Shared Sub SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy2()  \n    Dim policy As New RequestCachePolicy()  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Cache Management for Network Applications](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-management-for-network-applications.md)   \n [Cache Policy](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-policy.md)   \n [Location-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/location-based-cache-policies.md)   \n [Time-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/time-based-cache-policies.md)   \n [\\<requestCaching> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/requestcaching-element-network-settings.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,95],"content":"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,83]}]},{"pos":[560,626],"content":"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application","linkify":"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"The default time-based cache policy allows an application to have its cache behavior defined by the headers sent with the cached resource and the cache behavior defined in sections 13 and 14 of RFC 2616, available at <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>http://www.ietf.org<ept id=\"p1\">](http://www.ietf.org/)</ept>.","pos":[627,888],"source":"The default time-based cache policy allows an application to have its cache behavior defined by the headers sent with the cached resource and the cache behavior defined in sections 13 and 14 of RFC 2616, available at [http://www.ietf.org](http://www.ietf.org/)."},{"content":"This is the appropriate cache behavior for most applications.","pos":[889,950]},{"pos":[960,1014],"content":"To set the default automatic policy for an application","linkify":"To set the default automatic policy for an application","nodes":[{"content":"To set the default automatic policy for an application","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"Create a default time-based policy object.","pos":[1024,1066]},{"content":"Set the policy object as the default for the application domain.","pos":[1076,1140]},{"pos":[1149,1156],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The two examples in this section produce identical policies.","pos":[1160,1220]},{"content":"The following example creates a default time-based policy and sets it as the default for the application domain.","pos":[1227,1339]},{"content":"You can also create the default time-based cache policy using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy&gt;</ph> class as shown in the following example:","pos":[1719,1868],"source":"You can also create the default time-based cache policy using the <xref:System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy> class as shown in the following example:"},{"pos":[2241,2249],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Cache Management for Network Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-management-for-network-applications.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2253,2387],"source":"[Cache Management for Network Applications](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-management-for-network-applications.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Cache Policy<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-policy.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2390,2467],"source":" [Cache Policy](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-policy.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Location-Based Cache Policies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/location-based-cache-policies.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2470,2581],"source":" [Location-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/location-based-cache-policies.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Time-Based Cache Policies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/time-based-cache-policies.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2584,2687],"source":" [Time-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/time-based-cache-policies.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>requestCaching&gt;
