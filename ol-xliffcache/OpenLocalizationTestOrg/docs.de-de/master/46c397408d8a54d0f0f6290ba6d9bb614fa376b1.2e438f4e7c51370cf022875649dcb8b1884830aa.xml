Possible causes of this error include the following:  \n  \n-   A conversion specifies two data types between which no conversion exists. An example of this is a conversion from a `Boolean` value to the `Date` type.  \n  \n-   An initialization of an array does not include braces (`{}`) following a `New` clause. In this case, \\<type2> is of the form '1-dimensional array of \\<type>'.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30311  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure the expression can be converted to the destination data type.  \n  \n-   If \\<type2> is an array, make sure the `New` clause contains both parentheses and braces following the type name. The following code illustrates correct initialization of an array.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Dim anIntArray As Integer() = New Integer() {}  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Type Conversions in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-conversions.md)\n- [How to: Initialize an Array Variable in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/how-to-initialize-an-array-variable.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,217],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Value of type '<type1>' cannot be converted to '<type2>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30311\"\n  - \"vbc30311\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30311\"\nms.assetid: e3a513d4-2a1e-46d6-b592-b2e756b89d7d","nodes":[{"content":"Value of type '<type1>' cannot be converted to '<type2>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"Value of type '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;type1&gt;</ph>' cannot be converted to '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;type2&gt;</ph>'","source":"Value of type '<type1>' cannot be converted to '<type2>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[224,282],"content":"Value of type '\\<type1>' cannot be converted to '\\<type2>'","linkify":"Value of type '\\<type1>' cannot be converted to '\\<type2>'","nodes":[{"content":"Value of type '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>type1&gt;' cannot be converted to '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>type2&gt;'","pos":[0,58],"source":"Value of type '\\<type1>' cannot be converted to '\\<type2>'"}]},{"content":"A statement attempts to convert one data type to another in a way that is not defined.","pos":[283,369]},{"content":"Possible causes of this error include the following:","pos":[370,422]},{"content":"A conversion specifies two data types between which no conversion exists.","pos":[432,505]},{"content":"An example of this is a conversion from a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Boolean`</ph> value to the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Date`</ph> type.","pos":[506,583],"source":" An example of this is a conversion from a `Boolean` value to the `Date` type."},{"content":"An initialization of an array does not include braces (<ph id=\"ph1\">`{}`</ph>) following a <ph id=\"ph2\">`New`</ph> clause.","pos":[593,679],"source":"An initialization of an array does not include braces (`{}`) following a `New` clause."},{"content":"In this case, <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>type2&gt; is of the form '1-dimensional array of <ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>type&gt;'.","pos":[680,751],"source":" In this case, \\<type2> is of the form '1-dimensional array of \\<type>'."},{"pos":[758,779],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30311","source":"**Error ID:** BC30311"},{"pos":[788,809],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Make sure the expression can be converted to the destination data type.","pos":[819,890]},{"content":"If <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>type2&gt; is an array, make sure the <ph id=\"ph2\">`New`</ph> clause contains both parentheses and braces following the type name.","pos":[900,1013],"source":"If \\<type2> is an array, make sure the `New` clause contains both parentheses and braces following the type name."},{"content":"The following code illustrates correct initialization of an array.","pos":[1014,1080]},{"pos":[1165,1173],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1177,1298],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Type Conversions in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-conversions.md)</ept>","source":"[Type Conversions in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-conversions.md)"},{"pos":[1301,1457],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Initialize an Array Variable in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/how-to-initialize-an-array-variable.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Initialize an Array Variable in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/how-to-initialize-an-array-variable.md)"}]}
