For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To add an ActiveX control to your Windows Form  \n  \n-   Double-click the control on the Toolbox.  \n  \n     Visual Studio adds all references to the control in your project.
