If the computer is configured to require algorithms to be compliant with FIPS, and a class implements an algorithm that is not compliant with FIPS, any attempt to create an instance of that class throws an exception. Constructors throw an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception, and `Create` methods throw a <xref:System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException> exception with an inner <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception.  \n  \n If your application runs on computers whose configurations require compliance with FIPS, and your application uses an algorithm that is not compliant with FIPS, you can use this element in your configuration file to prevent the common language runtime (CLR) from enforcing FIPS compliance. This element was introduced in the [!INCLUDE[net_v20SP1_long](../../../../../includes/net-v20sp1-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to prevent the CLR from enforcing FIPS compliance.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n    <runtime>  \n        <enforceFIPSPolicy enabled=\"false\"/>  \n    </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Runtime
