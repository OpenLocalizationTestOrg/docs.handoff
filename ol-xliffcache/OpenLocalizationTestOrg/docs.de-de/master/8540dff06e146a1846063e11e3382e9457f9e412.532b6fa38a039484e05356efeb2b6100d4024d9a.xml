By using the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method to separate the fields, it is very easy to query and manipulate CSV files by using LINQ. In fact, the same technique can be used to reorder the parts of any structured line of text; it is not limited to CSV files.  \n  \n In the following example, assume that the three columns represent students' \"last name,\" \"first name\", and \"ID.\" The fields are in alphabetical order based on the students' last names. The query produces a new sequence in which the ID column appears first, followed by a second column that combines the student's first name and last name. The lines are reordered according to the ID field. The results are saved into a new file and the original data is not modified.  \n  \n### To create the data file  \n  \n1.  Copy the following lines into a plain text file that is named spreadsheet1.csv. Save the file in your project folder.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Adams,Terry,120  \n    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  \n    Feng,Hanying,117  \n    Garcia,Cesar,114  \n    Garcia,Debra,115  \n    Garcia,Hugo,118  \n    Mortensen,Sven,113  \n    O'Donnell,Claire,112  \n    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  \n    Tucker,Lance,119  \n    Tucker,Michael,122  \n    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \nClass CSVFiles  \n  \n    Shared Sub Main()  \n  \n        ' Create the IEnumerable data source.  \n        Dim lines As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(\"../../../spreadsheet1.csv\")  \n  \n        ' Execute the query.
