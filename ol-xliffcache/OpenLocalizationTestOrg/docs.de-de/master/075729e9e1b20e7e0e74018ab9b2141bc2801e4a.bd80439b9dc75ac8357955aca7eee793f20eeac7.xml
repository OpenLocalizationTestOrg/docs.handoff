This value must be 0 (zero).|  \n|`guidScheme`|The entity that adds the reference. This field can have one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   FUSION_REFCOUNT_MSI_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that was installed using the Microsoft Windows Installer. The `szIdentifier` field is set to `MSI`, and the `szNonCanonicalData` field is set to `Windows Installer`. This scheme is used for Windows side-by-side assemblies.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_UNINSTALL_SUBKEY_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that appears in the **Add/Remove Programs** interface. The `szIdentifier` field provides the token that registers the application with the **Add/Remove Programs** interface.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_FILEPATH_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that is represented by a file in the file system. The `szIdentifier` field provides the path to this file.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_OPAQUE_STRING_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that is represented only by an opaque string. The `szIdentifier` field provides this opaque string. The global assembly cache does not check for the existence of opaque references when you remove this value.<br />-   FUSION_REFCOUNT_OSINSTALL_GUID: This value is reserved.|  \n|`szIdentifier`|A unique string that identifies the application that installed the assembly in the global assembly cache. Its value depends upon the value of the `guidScheme` field.|  \n|`szNonCanonicalData`|A string that is understood only by the entity that adds the reference.
