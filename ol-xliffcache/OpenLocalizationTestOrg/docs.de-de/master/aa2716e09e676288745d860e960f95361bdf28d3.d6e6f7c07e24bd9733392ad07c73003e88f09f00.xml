There are two ways to specify how a service should publish metadata, using a configuration file and using code. This topic shows how to publish metadata for a service using a configuration file.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  This topic shows how to publish metadata in an unsecure manner. Any client can retrieve the metadata from the service. If you require your service to publish metadata in a secure manner, see [Custom Secure Metadata Endpoint](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-secure-metadata-endpoint.md).  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] publishing metadata in code, see [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md). Publishing metadata allows clients to retrieve the metadata using a WS-Transfer GET request or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string. To be sure that the code is working, create a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service. For simplicity, a basic self-hosted service is provided in the following code.  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;  \nusing System.ServiceModel;  \nusing System.ServiceModel.Description;  \n  \nnamespace Metadata.Samples  \n{  \n    [ServiceContract]  \n    public interface ISimpleService  \n    {  \n        [OperationContract]  \n        string SimpleMethod(string msg);  \n    }  \n  \n    class SimpleService : ISimpleService  \n    {  \n        public string SimpleMethod(string msg)  \n        {  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The caller passed in \" + msg);  \n            return \"Hello \" + msg;  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    class Program  \n    {  \n        static void Main(string[] args)  \n        {  \n            ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(SimpleService),  \n                new Uri(\"http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample\"));   \n            try  \n            {  \n                // Open the service host to accept incoming calls  \n                host.Open();  \n  \n                // The service can now be accessed.  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"The service is ready.\");  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate service.\");  \n                Console.WriteLine();  \n                Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n                // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  \n                host.Close();  \n            }  \n            catch (CommunicationException commProblem)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"There was a communication problem. \" + commProblem.Message);  \n                Console.Read();  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This service is a self-hosted service, which is configured using a configuration file. The following configuration file serves as a starting point.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <services>  \n      <service name=\"Metadata.Example.SimpleService\">  \n        <endpoint address=\"\"  \n                  binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"  \n                  contract=\"Metadata.Example.ISimpleService\" />  \n      </service>  \n    </services>  \n    <behaviors>  \n  \n    </behaviors>  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n  \n### To publish metadata for a WCF service using an application configuration file  \n  \n1.  Within the App.config file, after the closing `</services>` element, create a `<behaviors>` element.  \n  \n  \n  \n2.  Within the `<behaviors>` element, add a `<serviceBehaviors>` element.  \n  \n  \n  \n3.  Add a `<behavior>` element to the `<serviceBehaviors>` element and specify a value for the `name` attribute of the `<behavior>` element.  \n  \n  \n  \n4.  Add a `<serviceMetadata>` element to the `<behavior>` element. Set the `httpGetEnabled` attribute to `true` and the `policyVersion` attribute to Policy15. `httpGetEnabled` allows the service to respond to metadata requests made by an HTTP GET request. `policyVersion` tells the service to conform to WS-Policy 1.5 when generating metadata.  \n  \n  \n  \n5.  Add a `behaviorConfiguration` attribute to the `<service>` element and specify the `name` attribute of the `<behavior>` element added in step 1, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <services>  \n      <service  \n          name=\"Metadata.Example.SimpleService\"  \n          behaviorConfiguration=\"SimpleServiceBehavior\">  \n        ...  \n      </service>  \n    </services>  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"SimpleServiceBehavior\">  \n          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\" policyVersion=\"Policy15\" />  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Add one or more `<endpoint>` elements with the contract set to `IMetadataExchange`, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <services>  \n      <service  \n          name=\"Metadata.Example.SimpleService\"  \n          behaviorConfiguration=\"SimpleServiceBehavior\">  \n  \n        <endpoint address=\"\"  \n                  binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                  contract=\"Metadata.Example.ISimpleService\" />  \n  \n        <endpoint address=\"mex\"  \n                  binding=\"mexHttpBinding\"  \n                  contract=\"IMetadataExchange\" />  \n      </service>  \n    </services>  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  For the metadata endpoints added in the previous step, set the `binding` attribute to one of the following:  \n  \n    -   `mexHttpBinding` for HTTP publication.  \n  \n    -   `mexHttpsBinding` for HTTPS publication.  \n  \n    -   `mexNamedPipeBinding` for named pipe publication.  \n  \n    -   `mexTcpBinding` for TCP publication.  \n  \n8.  For the metadata endpoints added in a previous step, set the address equal to:  \n  \n    -   An empty string to use the host application's base address as the publication point if the base address is the same as the metadata binding.  \n  \n    -   A relative address if the host application has a base address.  \n  \n    -   An absolute address.  \n  \n9. Build and run the console application.  \n  \n10. Use Internet Explorer to browse to the base address of the service (http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample in this sample) and verify that the metadata publishing is turned on. If not, a message at the top of the resulting page displays: \"Metadata publishing for this service is currently disabled.\"  \n  \n### To use default endpoints  \n  \n1.  To configure metadata on a service that uses default endpoints, specify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> in the configuration file as in the previous example, but do not specify any endpoints. The configuration file would then look like this.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <configuration>  \n      <system.serviceModel>  \n        <behaviors>  \n          <serviceBehaviors>  \n            <behavior name=\"SimpleServiceBehavior\">  \n              <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\" policyVersion=\"Policy12\" />  \n            </behavior>  \n          </serviceBehaviors>  \n        </behaviors>  \n  \n      </system.serviceModel>  \n    </configuration>  \n    ```  \n  \n     Because the service has a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> with the `httpGetEnabled` set to `true`, the service has publishing metadata enabled, and because no endpoints were explicitly added, the runtime adds the default endpoints. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows the implementation of a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service and the configuration file that publishes metadata for the service.  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;  \nusing System.ServiceModel;  \nusing System.ServiceModel.Description;  \n  \nnamespace Metadata.Samples  \n{  \n    [ServiceContract]  \n    public interface ISimpleService  \n    {  \n        [OperationContract]  \n        string SimpleMethod(string msg);  \n    }  \n  \n    class SimpleService : ISimpleService  \n    {  \n        public string SimpleMethod(string msg)  \n        {  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The caller passed in \" + msg);  \n            return \"Hello \" + msg;  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    class Program  \n    {  \n        static void Main(string[] args)  \n        {  \n            ServiceHost host = new ServiceHost(typeof(SimpleService),  \n                new Uri(\"http://localhost:8001/MetadataSample\"));   \n            try  \n            {  \n                // Open the service host to accept incoming calls  \n                host.Open();  \n  \n                // The service can now be accessed.  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"The service is ready.\");  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate service.\");  \n                Console.WriteLine();  \n                Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n                // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  \n                host.Close();  \n            }  \n            catch (CommunicationException commProblem)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"There was a communication problem. \" + commProblem.Message);  \n                Console.Read();  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"SimpleServiceBehavior\">  \n          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled=\"True\" policyVersion=\"Policy12\" />  \n          <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults=\"False\" />  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior>   \n [How to: Host a WCF Service in a Managed Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-host-a-wcf-service-in-a-managed-application.md)   \n [Self-Host](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/self-host.md)   \n [Metadata Architecture Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/metadata-architecture-overview.md)   \n [Using Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-metadata.md)   \n [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: f061443f-92df-4824-b36a-609c4cd14a17\ncaps.latest.revision: 24\nauthor: \"Erikre\"\nms.author: \"erikre\"\nmanager: \"erikre\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,82],"content":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,82]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[393,458],"content":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File","linkify":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File","pos":[0,65]}]},{"content":"This is one of two how-to topics that demonstrate publishing metadata for a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> service.","pos":[459,599],"source":"This is one of two how-to topics that demonstrate publishing metadata for a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service."},{"content":"There are two ways to specify how a service should publish metadata, using a configuration file and using code.","pos":[600,711]},{"content":"This topic shows how to publish metadata for a service using a configuration file.","pos":[712,794]},{"pos":[802,1116],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n This topic shows how to publish metadata in an unsecure manner.
