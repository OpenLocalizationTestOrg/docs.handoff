{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Navigation property - ADO.NET\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: d0bf1a6a-1d84-484c-b7c3-b410fd8dc0b1\n---\n# Navigation property\n\nA *navigation property* is an optional property on an [entity type](entity-type.md) that allows for navigation from one [end](association-end.md) of an [association](association-type.md) to the other end. Unlike other [properties](property.md), navigation properties do not carry data.\n\nA navigation property definition includes the following:\n\n- A name. (Required)\n\n- The association that it navigates. (Required)\n\n- The ends of the association that it navigates. (Required)\n\nNote that navigation properties are optional on both entity types at the ends of an association. If you define a navigation property on one entity type at the end of an association, you do not have to define a navigation property on the entity type at the other end of the association.\n\nThe data type of a navigation property is determined by the [multiplicity](association-end-multiplicity.md) of its remote [association end](association-end.md). For example, suppose a navigation property, `OrdersNavProp`, exists on a `Customer` entity type and navigates a one-to-many association between `Customer` and `Order`. Because the remote association end for the navigation property has multiplicity of many (\\*), its data type is a collection (of `Order`). Similarly, if a navigation property, `CustomerNavProp`, exists on the `Order` entity type, its data type would be `Customer`, because the multiplicity of the remote end is one (1).\n\n## Example\n\nThe diagram below shows a conceptual model with three entity types: `Book`, `Publisher`, and `Author`. Navigation properties, `Publisher` and `Authors`, are defined on the Book entity type. Navigation property `Books` is defined on both the Publisher entity type and the `Author` entity type.\n\n ![Diagram showing a conceptual model with three entity types.](./media/navigation-property/conceptual-model-entity-types-associations.gif)  \n\nThe [ADO.NET Entity Framework](./ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](./ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines the `Book` entity type shown in the diagram above:\n\n[!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#EntityExample](~/samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books.edmx#entityexample)]\n\nNote that XML attributes are used to communicate the information necessary to define a navigation property: The attribute `Name` contains the name of the property, `Relationship` contains the name of the association it navigates, and `FromRole` and `ToRole` contain the ends of the association.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)\n- [Entity Data Model](entity-data-model.md)\n- [Relationships,
