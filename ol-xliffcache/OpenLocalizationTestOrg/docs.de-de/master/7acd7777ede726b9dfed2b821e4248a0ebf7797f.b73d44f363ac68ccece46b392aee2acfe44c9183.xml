For example, you can configure the control to automatically resize the width of its columns based only on the values in rows that are currently displayed. With this, you can avoid inefficiency when working with large numbers of rows, although in this case, you might want to use sizing methods such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoResizeColumns%2A> to adjust sizes at times of your choosing.  \n  \n For more information about automatic resizing, see [Sizing Options in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](sizing-options-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates the options available for automatic resizing.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing#0](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing/CPP/autosizing.cpp#0)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing#0](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing/CS/autosizing.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing#0](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AutoSizing/VB/autosizing.vb#0)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n-   For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
