You can add it to the **DataSet** by using the **Add** method to add it to the **DataTable** object's **Tables** collection.  \n  \n You can also create **DataTable** objects within a **DataSet** by using the **Fill** or **FillSchema** methods of the **DataAdapter** object, or from a predefined or inferred XML schema using the **ReadXml**, **ReadXmlSchema**, or **InferXmlSchema** methods of the **DataSet**. Note that after you have added a **DataTable** as a member of the **Tables** collection of one **DataSet**, you cannot add it to the collection of tables of any other **DataSet**.  \n  \n When you first create a **DataTable**, it does not have a schema (that is, a structure). To define the schema of the table, you must create and add <xref:System.Data.DataColumn> objects to the **Columns** collection of the table. You can also define a primary key column for the table, and create and add **Constraint** objects to the **Constraints** collection of the table. After you have defined the schema for a **DataTable**, you can add rows of data to the table by adding **DataRow** objects to the **Rows** collection of the table.  \n  \n You are not required to supply a value for the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.TableName%2A> property when you create a **DataTable**; you can specify the property at another time, or you can leave it empty. However, when you add a table without a **TableName** value to a **DataSet**, the table will be given an incremental default name of Table*N*, starting with \"Table\" for Table0.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  We recommend that you avoid the \"Table*N*\" naming convention when you supply a **TableName** value, because the name you supply may conflict with an existing default table name in the **DataSet**. If the supplied name already exists, an exception is thrown.  \n  \n The following example creates an instance of a **DataTable** object and assigns it the name \"Customers.\"  \n  \n```vb  \nDim workTable as DataTable = New DataTable(\"Customers\")  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataTable workTable = new DataTable(\"Customers\");  \n```  \n  \n The following example creates an instance of a **DataTable** by adding it to the **Tables** collection of a **DataSet**.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim customers As DataSet = New DataSet  \nDim customersTable As DataTable = _  \n   customers.Tables.Add(\"CustomersTable\")  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataSet customers = new DataSet();  \nDataTable customersTable = customers.Tables.Add(\"CustomersTable\");  \n```  \n  \n## See
