You might want to find the second element, or you might want to find the third through the fifth element.  \n  \n The XPath expression is:  \n  \n `Test[position() >= 2 and position() <= 4]`  \n  \n There are two approaches to writing this [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] query in a lazy way. You can use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Skip%2A> and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Take%2A> operators, or you can use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> overload that takes an index. When you use the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> overload, you use a lambda expression that takes two arguments. The following example shows both methods of selecting based on position.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example finds the second through the fourth `Test` element. The result is a collection of elements.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Test Configuration (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-test-configuration-linq-to-xml.md).  \n  \n```vb  \nDim testCfg As XElement = XElement.Load(\"TestConfig.xml\")  \n  \n' LINQ to XML query  \nDim list1 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = _  \n    testCfg.Elements(\"Test\").Skip(1).Take(3)  \n  \n'LINQ to XML query  \nDim list2 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = _  \n    testCfg.Elements(\"Test\"). _  \n    Where(Function(ByVal el, ByVal idx) idx >= 1 And idx <= 3)  \n  \n' XPath expression  \nDim list3 As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = _  \n    testCfg.XPathSelectElements(\"Test[position() >= 2 and position() <= 4]\")  \n  \nIf list1.Count() = list2.Count() And _  \n       list1.Count() = list3.Count() And _  \n       list1.Intersect(list2).Count() = list1.Count() And _  \n       list1.Intersect(list3).Count() = list1.Count() Then  \n  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results are identical\")  \nElse  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results differ\")  \nEnd If  \n  \nFor Each el As XElement In list1  \n    Console.WriteLine(el)  \nNext  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nResults are identical  \n<Test TestId=\"0002\" TestType=\"CMD\">  \n  <Name>Find succeeding characters</Name>  \n  <CommandLine>Examp2.EXE</CommandLine>  \n  <Input>abc</Input>  \n  <Output>def</Output>  \n</Test>  \n<Test TestId=\"0003\" TestType=\"GUI\">  \n  <Name>Convert multiple numbers to strings</Name>  \n  <CommandLine>Examp2.EXE /Verbose</CommandLine>  \n  <Input>123</Input>  \n  <Output>One Two Three</Output>  \n</Test>  \n<Test TestId=\"0004\" TestType=\"GUI\">  \n  <Name>Find correlated key</Name>  \n  <CommandLine>Examp3.EXE</CommandLine>  \n  <Input>a1</Input>  \n  <Output>b1</Output>  \n</Test>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to XML for XPath Users (Visual
