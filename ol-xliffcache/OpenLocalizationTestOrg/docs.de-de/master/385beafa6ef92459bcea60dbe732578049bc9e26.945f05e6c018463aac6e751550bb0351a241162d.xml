For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control usually displays a caption indicating what action will be performed when the button is clicked. For all controls, you can set or return the text by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property. You can change the font by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property. You can also set the text using the designer.  Also see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233673\\(v=vs.110\\)), [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233665\\(v=vs.110\\)), [How to: Set the Image Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233656\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n### To set the text displayed by a control programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property to a string.  \n  \n     To create an underlined access key, includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the access key.  \n  \n2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property to an object of type <xref:System.Drawing.Font>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Text = \"Click here to save changes\"  \n    Button1.Font = New Font(\"Arial\", 10, FontStyle.Bold, GraphicsUnit.Point)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Text = \"Click here to save changes\";  \n    button1.Font = new Font(\"Arial\", 10, FontStyle.Bold,  \n       GraphicsUnit.Point);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp#  \n    button1->Text = \"Click here to save changes\";  \n    button1->Font = new System::Drawing::Font(\"Arial\",  \n       10, FontStyle::Bold, GraphicsUnit::Point);  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can use an escape character to display a special character in user-interface elements that would normally interpret them differently, such as menu items. For example, the following line of code sets the menu item's text to read \"& Now For Something Completely Different\":  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MPMenuItem.Text = \"&& Now For Something Completely Different\"  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    mpMenuItem.Text = \"&& Now For Something Completely Different\";  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp#  \n    mpMenuItem->Text = \"&& Now For Something Completely Different\";  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md)   \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,939],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
