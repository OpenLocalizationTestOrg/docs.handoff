If the `ValueName`,  \"Name\" in the following example, does not exist, `Nothing` is returned.  \n  \n The `GetValue` method can also be used to determine whether a given value exists in a specific registry key.  \n  \n When code reads the registry from a Web application, the current user is determined by the authentication and impersonation that is implemented in the Web application.  \n  \n### To read a value from a registry key  \n  \n-   Use the `GetValue` method, specifying the path and name) to read a value from registry key. The following example reads the value `Name` from `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\MyApp` and displays it in a message box.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#4](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-a-value-from-a-registry-key_1.vb)]  \n  \n This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Operating System > Registry**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n### To determine whether a value exists in a registry key  \n  \n-   Use the `GetValue` method to retrieve the value. The following code checks whether the value exists and returns a message if it does not.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbResourceTasks#12](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-a-value-from-a-registry-key_2.vb)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The registry holds top-level, or root, keys that are used to store data. For instance, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE root key is used for storing machine-level settings used by all users, while HKEY_CURRENT_USER is used for storing data specific to an individual user.  \n  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The name of the key is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have permissions to read from registry keys (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n-   The key name exceeds the 255-character limit (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n To run this process, your assembly requires a privilege level granted by the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.RegistryPermission> class. If you are running in a partial-trust context, the process might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges. Similarly, the user must have the correct ACLs for creating or writing to settings. For example, a local application that has the code access security permission might not have operating system permission.
