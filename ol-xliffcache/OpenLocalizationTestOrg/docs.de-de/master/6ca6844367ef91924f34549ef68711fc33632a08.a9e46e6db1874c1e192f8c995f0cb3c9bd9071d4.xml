In [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, however, service contracts specify what error information is returned to clients by declaring SOAP faults in the service contract. For an overview of the relationship between exceptions and faults, see [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md).  \n  \n### Create a service contract that specifies a SOAP fault  \n  \n1.  Create a service contract that contains at least one operation. For an example, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md).  \n  \n2.  Select an operation that can specify an error condition about which clients can expect to be notified. To decide which error conditions justify returning SOAP faults to clients, see [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md).  \n  \n3.  Apply a <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> to the selected operation and pass a serializable fault type to the constructor. For details about creating and using serializable types, see [Specifying Data Transfer in Service Contracts](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/specifying-data-transfer-in-service-contracts.md). The following example shows how to specify that the `SampleMethod` operation can result in a `GreetingFault`.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[FaultContractAttribute#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/faultcontractattribute/cs/services.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[FaultContractAttribute#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/faultcontractattribute/vb/services.vb#4)]  \n  \n4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all operations in the contract that communicate error conditions to clients.  \n  \n## Implementing an Operation to Return a Specified SOAP Fault  \n Once an operation has specified that a specific SOAP fault can be returned (such as in the preceding procedure) to communicate an error condition to a calling application, the next step is to implement that specification.  \n  \n#### Throw the specified SOAP fault in the operation  \n  \n1.  When a <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultContractAttribute>-specified error condition occurs in an operation, throw a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.FaultException%601?displayProperty=fullName> where the specified SOAP fault is the type parameter. The following example shows how to throw the `GreetingFault` in the `SampleMethod` shown in the preceding procedure and in the following Code section.  \n  \n

[!code-vb[FaultContractAttribute#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/faultcontractattribute/vb/services.vb#5)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows an implementation of a single operation that specifies a `GreetingFault` for the `SampleMethod` operation.  \n  \n
