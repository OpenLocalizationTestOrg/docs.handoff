The guessing game selects a random number and the player has to guess that number. When the player submits an incorrect guess, the workflow provides a hint whether to guess higher or lower. If the player guesses the number in less than 7 attempts, a special congratulations is displayed to the user.  \n  \n## Custom Activities in this Sample  \n  \n### ReadLine  \n Reads a line of text from the console. This activity derives from the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> class and creates a bookmark that is resumed by the console application when a line is read.  \n  \n### PromptInt  \n Prompts the user to type in a number and then reads it from a console window. The activity derives from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601> and uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> and `ReadLine` activities.  \n  \n##### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the GuessingGame.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
