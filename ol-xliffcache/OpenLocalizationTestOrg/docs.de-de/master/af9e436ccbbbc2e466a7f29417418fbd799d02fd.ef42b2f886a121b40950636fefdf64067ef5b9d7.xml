A graceful abort includes attempts to run all `finally` blocks, any `catch` blocks related to thread aborts, and finalizers.|  \n|`eDisableRuntime`|Specifies that the CLR should enter a disabled state. No further managed code can be executed in the affected process, and threads are blocked from entering the CLR.|  \n|`eExitProcess`|Specifies that the CLR should attempt a graceful exit of the process, including running finalizers and performing cleanup and logging operations.|  \n|`eFastExitProcess`|Specifies that the CLR should exit the process immediately, without running finalizers or performing cleanup and logging operations. Nowever, notification is sent to the debugger.|  \n|`eNoAction`|Specifies that no action should be taken.|  \n|`eRudeAbortThread`|Specifies that the CLR should perform a rude thread abort. Only those `catch` and `finally` blocks marked with <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.MustRunInClientContextAttribute> are executed.|  \n|`eRudeExitProcess`|Specifies that the CLR should exit the process without running finalizers or logging operations.|  \n|`eRudeUnloadAppDomain`|Specifies that the CLR should perform a rude unload of the <xref:System.AppDomain>. Only finalizers marked with <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.MustRunInClientContextAttribute> are executed. Similarly, all threads with this <xref:System.AppDomain> in their stack receive a `ThreadAbortException`, but only those `catch` and `finally` blocks marked with <xref:System.EnterpriseServices.MustRunInClientContextAttribute> are executed.|  \n|`eThrowException`|Specifies that an exception appropriate to the condition, such as out-of-memory, buffer overflow, and so forth, should be thrown.|  \n|`eUnloadAppDomain`|Specifies that the <xref:System.AppDomain> should be unloaded. The CLR attempts to run finalizers.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The host sets policy actions by calling methods of the [ICLRPolicyManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrpolicymanager-interface.md) interface. For information about rude and graceful aborts, see the [EClrOperation](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/eclroperation-enumeration.md) enumeration.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n
