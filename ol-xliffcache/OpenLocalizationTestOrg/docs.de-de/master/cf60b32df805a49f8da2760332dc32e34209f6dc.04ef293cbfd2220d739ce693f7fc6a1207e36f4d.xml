All drawing done by a given <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object is restricted to the clip region of that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. You can set the clip region by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs a path that consists of a single polygon. Then the code constructs a region, based on that path. The region is passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, and then two strings are drawn.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the clipped strings.  \n  \n ![Clip](./media/clip1.png \"clip1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#41](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#41](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Regions in GDI+](regions-in-gdi.md)\n- [Using Regions](using-regions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,273],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Clipping with a Region\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"regions [Windows Forms], clipping\"\n  - \"regions [Windows Forms], restricting drawing surface\"\nms.assetid: 43d121b4-e14c-4901-b25c-2d6c25ba4e29","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","pos":[0,34]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[280,314],"content":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","linkify":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Clipping with a Region","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"One of the properties of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class is the clip region.","pos":[315,400],"source":"One of the properties of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class is the clip region."},{"content":"All drawing done by a given <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object is restricted to the clip region of that <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[401,546],"source":" All drawing done by a given <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object is restricted to the clip region of that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object."},{"content":"You can set the clip region by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[547,639],"source":" You can set the clip region by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method."},{"pos":[648,655],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example constructs a path that consists of a single polygon.","pos":[659,733]},{"content":"Then the code constructs a region, based on that path.","pos":[734,788]},{"content":"The region is passed to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A&gt;</ph> method of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> object, and then two strings are drawn.","pos":[789,941],"source":" The region is passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.SetClip%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, and then two strings are drawn."},{"content":"The following illustration shows the clipped strings.","pos":[948,1001]},{"pos":[1008,1042],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Clip<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/clip1.png \"</bpt>clip1<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Clip](./media/clip1.png \"clip1\")"},{"pos":[1353,1371],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1375,1571],"content":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`e`</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1580,1588],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1592,1628],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Regions in GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](regions-in-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[Regions in GDI+](regions-in-gdi.md)"},{"pos":[1631,1664],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Regions<ept id=\"p1\">](using-regions.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Regions](using-regions.md)"}]}
