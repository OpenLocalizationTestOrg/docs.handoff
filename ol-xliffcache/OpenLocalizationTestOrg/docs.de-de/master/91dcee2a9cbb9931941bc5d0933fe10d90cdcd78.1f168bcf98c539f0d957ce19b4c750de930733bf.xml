When you bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to such a collection, each public property is displayed in its own column unless the property has been marked non-browsable with a <xref:System.ComponentModel.BrowsableAttribute>. For example, a collection of `Customer` objects would have columns such as **Name** and **Address**.  \n  \n If these objects contain additional information and code that you want to access, you can reach it through row objects. In the following code example, users can select multiple rows and click a button to send an invoice to each of the corresponding customers.  \n  \n### To access row-bound objects  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow.DataBoundItem%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding/CS/datagridviewobjectbinding.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewObjectBinding/VB/datagridviewobjectbinding.vb#10)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The complete code example includes a simple `Customer` implementation and binds the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> containing a few `Customer` objects.
