The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A> property indicates whether the row for new records is present at the bottom of the control, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToDeleteRows%2A> property indicates whether rows can be removed. The following code example uses these properties and also sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ReadOnly%2A> property to make the control entirely read-only.  \n  \n There is support for this task in Visual Studio. Also see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#090](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/CS/datagridviewmisc.cs#090)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#090](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/VB/datagridviewmisc.vb#090)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control named `dataGridView1`.  \n  \n-   References to the <xref:System?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType> assemblies.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ReadOnly%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToDeleteRows%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Basic Column, Row, and Cell Features in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](basic-column-row-and-cell-features-wf-datagridview-control.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,396],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
