Create a new class using [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], C#, or any other common language runtime language.  \n  \n2.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> class to the class.  \n  \n3.  Create methods in the class.  \n  \n4.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each method that must be exposed as part of the public [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] contract.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows a class that defines a service contract.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithClass#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithclass/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithClass#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithclass/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n The methods that have the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class applied use a request-reply message pattern by default. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] this message pattern, see [How to: Create a Request-Reply Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-request-reply-contract.md). You can also create and use other message patterns by setting properties of the attribute.
