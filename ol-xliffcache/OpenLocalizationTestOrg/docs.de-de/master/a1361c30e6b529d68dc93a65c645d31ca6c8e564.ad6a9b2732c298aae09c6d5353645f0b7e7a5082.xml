The **dotnet-svcutil** tool as a .NET Core CLI tool, is available cross-platform on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> You should only reference services from a trusted source. Adding references from an untrusted source may compromise security.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n# [dotnet-svcutil 2.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil2x)\n* [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later versions\n* Your favorite code editor\n\n# [dotnet-svcutil 1.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil1x)\n* [.NET Core 1.0.4 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later versions\n* Your favorite code editor\n\n---\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe following example walks you through the steps required to add a web service reference to a .NET Core web project and invoke the service. You'll create a .NET Core web application named _HelloSvcutil_ and add a reference to a web service that implements the following contract:\n\n```csharp\n[ServiceContract]\npublic interface ISayHello\n{\n    [OperationContract]\n    string Hello(string name);\n}\n```\n\nFor this example, let's assume the web service will be hosted at the following address: `http://contoso.com/SayHello.svc`\n\nFrom a Windows, macOS, or Linux command window perform the following steps:\n\n1. Create a directory named _HelloSvcutil_ for your project and make it your current directory, as in the following example:\n\n```console\nmkdir HelloSvcutil\ncd HelloSvcutil\n```\n\n2. Create a new C# web project in that directory using the [`dotnet new`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) command as follows:\n\n```console\ndotnet new web\n```\n\n3. Install the [`dotnet-svcutil` NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/dotnet-svcutil) as a CLI tool:\n# [dotnet-svcutil 2.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil2x)\n```console\ndotnet tool install --global dotnet-svcutil\n```\n\n# [dotnet-svcutil 1.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil1x)\nOpen the `HelloSvcutil.csproj` project file in your editor, edit the `Project` element, and add the [`dotnet-svcutil` NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/dotnet-svcutil) as a CLI tool reference, using the following code:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <DotNetCliToolReference Include=\"dotnet-svcutil\" Version=\"1.0.*\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThen restore the _dotnet-svcutil_ package using the [`dotnet restore`](../tools/dotnet-restore.md) command as follows:\n\n```console\ndotnet restore\n```\n\n---\n\n4. Run the _dotnet-svcutil_ command to generate the web service reference file as follows:\n# [dotnet-svcutil 2.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil2x)\n```console\ndotnet-svcutil http://contoso.com/SayHello.svc\n```\n\n# [dotnet-svcutil 1.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil1x)\n```console\ndotnet svcutil http://contoso.com/SayHello.svc\n```\n---\n\nThe generated file is saved as _HelloSvcutil/ServiceReference/Reference.cs_. The _dotnet-svcutil_ tool also adds to the project the appropriate WCF packages required by the proxy code as package references.\n\n## Using the Service Reference\n\n1. Restore the WCF packages using the [`dotnet restore`](../tools/dotnet-restore.md) command as follows:\n\n```console\ndotnet restore\n```\n\n2. Find the name of the client class and operation you want to use. `Reference.cs` will contain a class that inherits from `System.ServiceModel.ClientBase`, with methods that can be used to call operations on the service. In this example, you want to call the _SayHello_ service's _Hello_ operation. `ServiceReference.SayHelloClient` is the name of the client class, and has a method called `HelloAsync` that can be used to call the operation.\n\n3. Open the `Startup.cs` file in your editor, and add a using statement for the service reference namespace at the top:\n\n```csharp\nusing ServiceReference;\n```\n\n 4. Edit the `Configure` method to invoke the web service. You do this by creating an instance of the class that inherits from `ClientBase` and calling the method on the client object:\n\n```csharp\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)\n{\n    if (env.IsDevelopment())\n    {\n        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();\n    }\n\n    app.Run(async (context) =>\n    {\n        var client = new SayHelloClient();\n        var response = await client.HelloAsync();\n        await context.Response.WriteAsync(response);\n    });\n}\n\n```\n\n5. Run the application using the [`dotnet run`](../tools/dotnet-run.md) command as follows:\n\n```console\ndotnet run\n```\n\n6. Navigate to the URL listed in the console (for example, `http://localhost:5000`) in your web browser.\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\"Hello dotnet-svcutil!\"\n\nFor a detailed description of the `dotnet-svcutil` tool parameters, invoke the tool passing the help parameter as follows:\n# [dotnet-svcutil 2.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil2x)\n```console\ndotnet-svcutil --help\n```\n\n# [dotnet-svcutil 1.x](#tab/dotnetsvcutil1x)\n```console\ndotnet svcutil --help\n```\n---\n\n## Feedback & questions\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf/issues/new).
