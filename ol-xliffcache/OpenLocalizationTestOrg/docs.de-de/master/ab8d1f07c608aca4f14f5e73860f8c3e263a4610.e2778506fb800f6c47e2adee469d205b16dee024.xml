If you have special needs that go beyond the capabilities of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle> class, however, you can also implement owner drawing for the control or extend its capabilities by creating custom cells, columns, and rows.  \n  \n To paint cells and rows yourself, you can handle various `DataGridView` painting events. To modify existing functionality or provide new functionality, you can create your own types derived from the existing `DataGridViewCell`, `DataGridViewColumn`, and `DataGridViewRow` types. You can also provide new editing capabilities by creating derived types that display a control of your choosing when a cell is in edit mode.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Customize the Appearance of Cells in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](customize-the-appearance-of-cells-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellPainting> event in order to paint cells manually.  \n  \n [How to: Customize the Appearance of Rows in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](customize-the-appearance-of-rows-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPostPaint> events in order to paint rows with a custom, gradient background and content that spans multiple columns.  \n  \n [How to: Customize Cells and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control by Extending Their Behavior and Appearance](customize-cells-and-columns-in-the-datagrid-by-extending-behavior.md)  \n Describes how to create custom types derived from `DataGridViewCell` and `DataGridViewColumn` in order to highlight cells when the mouse pointer rests on them.  \n  \n [How to: Disable Buttons in a Button Column in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](disable-buttons-in-a-button-column-in-the-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to create custom types derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonColumn> in order to display disabled buttons in a button column.  \n  \n [How to: Host Controls in Windows Forms DataGridView Cells](how-to-host-controls-in-windows-forms-datagridview-cells.md)  \n Describes how to implement the `IDataGridViewEditingControl` interface and create custom types derived from `DataGridViewCell` and `DataGridViewColumn` in order to display a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control when a cell is in edit mode.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>  \n
