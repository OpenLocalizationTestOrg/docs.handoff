It implements a panel control named `DemoFlowPanel`, which overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LayoutEngine%2A> property to provide an instance of the `DemoFlowLayout` class.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/cpp/DemoFlowLayout.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/CS/DemoFlowLayout.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine/VB/DemoFlowLayout.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LayoutEngine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,409],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"layout engines [Windows Forms], custom\"\n  - \"TableLayoutPanel control [Windows Forms], layout engine\"\n  - \"layout engines [Windows Forms], implementing\"\n  - \"FlowLayoutPanel control [Windows Forms], layout engine\"\nms.assetid: f91aa91c-29f4-4089-95ca-5d48b774b00e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","pos":[0,40]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[416,456],"content":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","linkify":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"The following code example demonstrates how to create a custom layout engine that performs a simple flow layout.","pos":[457,569]},{"content":"It implements a panel control named <ph id=\"ph1\">`DemoFlowPanel`</ph>, which overrides the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LayoutEngine%2A&gt;</ph> property to provide an instance of the <ph id=\"ph3\">`DemoFlowLayout`</ph> class.","pos":[570,757],"source":" It implements a panel control named `DemoFlowPanel`, which overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LayoutEngine%2A> property to provide an instance of the `DemoFlowLayout` class."},{"pos":[766,773],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1297,1305],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
