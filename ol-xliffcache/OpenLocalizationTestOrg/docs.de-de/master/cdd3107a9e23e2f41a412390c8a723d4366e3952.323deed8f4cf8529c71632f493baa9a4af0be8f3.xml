For more information, see [Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md), [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md) and [Indexers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/indexers/index.md).  \n  \nThe following example defines both a `get` and a `set` accessor for a property named `Seconds`. It uses a private field named `_seconds` to back the property value.  \n \n [!code-cs[get#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-1.cs)]  \n  \nOften, the `get` accessor consists of a single statement that returns a value, as it did in the previous example. Starting with C# 7, you can implement the `get` accessor as an expression-bodied member. The following example implements both the `get` and the `set` accessor as expression-bodied members.\n\n [!code-cs[get#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-3.cs)]   \n \nFor simple cases in which a property's `get` and `set` accessors perform no other operation than setting or retrieving a value in a private backing field, you can take advantage of the C# compiler's support for auto-implemented properties. The following example implements `Hours` as an auto-implemented property. \n  \n [!code-cs[get#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/get/get-2.cs)]  \n  \n## C# Language Specification\n\n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Keywords](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md)\n [Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,556],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"get (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2017-03-10\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
