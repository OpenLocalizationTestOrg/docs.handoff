Any `Boolean` or numeric expression.  \n  \n `expression`  \n Required. Any `Boolean` or numeric expression.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n For `Boolean` expressions, the following table illustrates how `result` is determined.  \n  \n|If `expression` is|The value of `result` is|  \n|------------------------|------------------------------|  \n|`True`|`False`|  \n|`False`|`True`|  \n  \n For numeric expressions, the `Not` operator inverts the bit values of any numeric expression and sets the corresponding bit in `result` according to the following table.  \n  \n|If bit in `expression` is|The bit in `result` is|  \n|-------------------------------|----------------------------|  \n|1|0|  \n|0|1|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Since the logical and bitwise operators have a lower precedence than other arithmetic and relational operators, any bitwise operations should be enclosed in parentheses to ensure accurate execution.  \n  \n## Data Types  \n For a Boolean negation, the data type of the result is `Boolean`. For a bitwise negation, the result data type is the same as that of `expression`. However, if expression is `Decimal`, the result is `Long`.  \n  \n## Overloading  \n The `Not` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when its operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `Not` operator to perform logical negation on a `Boolean` expression. The result is a `Boolean` value that represents the reverse of the value of the expression.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#33](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/not-operator_1.vb)]  \n  \n The preceding example produces results of `False` and `True`, respectively.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `Not` operator to perform logical negation of the individual bits of a numeric expression. The bit in the result pattern is set to the reverse of the corresponding bit in the operand pattern, including the sign bit.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#34](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/not-operator_2.vb)]  \n  \n The preceding example produces results of –11, –9, and –7, respectively.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Logical/Bitwise Operators (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/logical-bitwise-operators.md)   \n [Operator Precedence in Visual
