This topic provides an overview of the scheme, covers how to construct pack              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)] for a variety of scenarios, discusses absolute and relative              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)] and              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] resolution, before showing how to use pack              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)] from both markup and code.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"The_Pack_URI_Scheme\"></a>   \n## The Pack URI Scheme  \n The pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] scheme is used by the                  [Open Packaging Conventions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=71255) (OPC) specification, which describes a model for organizing and identifying content. The key elements of this model are packages and parts, where a                  *package* is a logical container for one or more logical                  *parts*. The following figure illustrates this concept.  \n  \n ![Package and Parts diagram](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/wpfpackurischemefigure1.PNG \"WPFPackURISchemeFigure1\")  \n  \n To identify parts, the OPC specification leverages the extensibility of RFC 2396 (Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax) to define the pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] scheme.  \n  \n The scheme that is specified by a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] is defined by its prefix; http, ftp, and file are well-known examples. The pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] scheme uses \"pack\" as its scheme, and contains two components: authority and path. The following is the format for a pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)].  \n  \n pack://                 *authority*/                 *path*  \n  \n The                  *authority* specifies the type of package that a part is contained by, while the                  *path* specifies the location of a part within a package.  \n  \n This concept is illustrated by the following figure:  \n  \n ![Relationship among package, authority, and path](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/wpfpackurischemefigure2.PNG \"WPFPackURISchemeFigure2\")  \n  \n Packages and parts are analogous to applications and files, where an application (package) can include one or more files (parts), including:  \n  \n-   Resource files that are compiled into the local assembly.  \n  \n-   Resource files that are compiled into a referenced assembly.  \n  \n-   Resource files that are compiled into a referencing assembly.  \n  \n-   Content files.  \n  \n-   Site of origin files.  \n  \n To access these types of files,                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] supports two authorities: application:/// and siteoforigin:///. The application:/// authority identifies application data files that are known at compile time, including resource and content files. The siteoforigin:/// authority identifies site of origin files. The scope of each authority is shown in the following figure.  \n  \n ![Pack URI diagram](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/wpfpackurischemefigure4.png \"WPFPackURISchemeFigure4\")  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The authority component of a pack                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] is an embedded                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that points to a package and must conform to RFC 2396. Additionally, the \"/\" character must be replaced with the \",\" character, and reserved characters such as \"%\" and \"?\" must be escaped. See the OPC for details.  \n  \n The following sections explain how to construct pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)] using these two authorities in conjunction with the appropriate paths for identifying resource, content, and site of origin files.  \n  \n<a name=\"Resource_File_Pack_URIs___Local_Assembly\"></a>   \n## Resource File Pack URIs  \n Resource files are configured as                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`Resource` items and are compiled into assemblies.

This is used when two or more referenced assemblies with the same short name are loaded.  \n  \n    -   **;PublicKey** [optional]: the public key that was used to sign the referenced assembly. This is used when two or more referenced assemblies with the same short name are loaded.  \n  \n    -   **;component**: specifies that the assembly being referred to is referenced from the local assembly.  \n  \n    -   **/Path**: the name of the resource file, including its path, relative to the root of the referenced assembly's project folder.  \n  \n The following example shows the pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for a                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] resource file that is located in the root of the referenced assembly's project folder.  \n  \n `pack://application:,,,/ReferencedAssembly;component/ResourceFile.xaml`  \n  \n The following example shows the pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for a                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] resource file that is located in a subfolder of the referenced assembly's project folder.  \n  \n `pack://application:,,,/ReferencedAssembly;component/Subfolder/ResourceFile.xaml`  \n  \n The following example shows the pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for a                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] resource file that is located in the root folder of a referenced, version-specific assembly's project folder.  \n  \n `pack://application:,,,/ReferencedAssembly;v1.0.0.1;component/ResourceFile.xaml`  \n  \n Note that the pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] syntax for referenced assembly resource files can be used only with the application:/// authority.

As a simplification for developers,                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] elements typically allow you to set appropriate attributes with a relative pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)], which includes only the path.  \n  \n For example, consider the following absolute pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] for a resource file in the local assembly.  \n  \n `pack://application:,,,/ResourceFile.xaml`  \n  \n The relative pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that refers to this resource file would be the following.  \n  \n `/ResourceFile.xaml`  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because site of origin files are not associated with assemblies, they can only be referred to with absolute pack                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)].  \n  \n By default, a relative pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] is considered relative to the location of the markup or code that contains the reference. If a leading backslash is used, however, the relative pack                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] reference is then considered relative to the root of the application.
