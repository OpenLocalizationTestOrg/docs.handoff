The Properties object exposes all of the default settings for the project via the Properties.Settings.Default member.  \n  \n### To Read Settings at Run Time with C#  \n  \n-   Access the appropriate setting via the Properties.Settings.Default member. The following example shows how to assign a setting named `myColor` to a BackColor property. It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named `myColor` of type `System.Drawing.Color`. For information about creating a Settings file, see [How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n    ```  \n    // C#  \n    this.BackColor = Properties.Settings.Default.myColor;  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)   \n [How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md)   \n [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[582,623],"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","linkify":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"You can read both Application-scoped and User-scoped settings at run time via the Properties object.","pos":[626,726]},{"content":"The Properties object exposes all of the default settings for the project via the Properties.Settings.Default member.","pos":[727,844]},{"pos":[854,890],"content":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","linkify":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","nodes":[{"content":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"Access the appropriate setting via the Properties.Settings.Default member.","pos":[900,974]},{"content":"The following example shows how to assign a setting named <ph id=\"ph1\">`myColor`</ph> to a BackColor property.","pos":[975,1067],"source":" The following example shows how to assign a setting named `myColor` to a BackColor property."},{"content":"It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named <ph id=\"ph1\">`myColor`</ph> of type <ph id=\"ph2\">`System.Drawing.Color`</ph>.","pos":[1068,1195],"source":" It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named `myColor` of type `System.Drawing.Color`."},{"content":"For information about creating a Settings file, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md)</ept>.","pos":[1196,1386],"source":" For information about creating a Settings file, see [How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md)."},{"pos":[1490,1498],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Settings and User Settings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1502,1643],"source":"[Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1646,1797],"source":" [How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Application Settings Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1800,1911],"source":" [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)"}]}
