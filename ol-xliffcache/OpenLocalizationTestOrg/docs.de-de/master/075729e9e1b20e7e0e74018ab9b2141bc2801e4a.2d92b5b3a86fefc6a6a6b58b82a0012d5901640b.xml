This field can have one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   FUSION_REFCOUNT_MSI_GUID: The assembly is referenced by an application that was installed using the Microsoft Windows Installer. The `szIdentifier` field is set to `MSI`, and the `szNonCanonicalData` field is set to `Windows Installer`.
