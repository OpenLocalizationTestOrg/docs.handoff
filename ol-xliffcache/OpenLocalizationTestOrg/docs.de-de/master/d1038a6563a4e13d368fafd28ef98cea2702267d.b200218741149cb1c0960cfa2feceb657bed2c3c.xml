This walkthrough shows how you can use data binding in hybrid applications that include both              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] and              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  \n  \n-   Creating the project.  \n  \n-   Defining the data template.  \n  \n-   Specifying the form layout.  \n  \n-   Specifying data bindings.  \n  \n-   Displaying data by using interoperation.  \n  \n-   Adding the data source to the project.  \n  \n-   Binding to the data source.  \n  \n For a complete code listing of the tasks illustrated in this walkthrough, see              [Data Binding in Hybrid Applications Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159983).  \n  \n When you are finished, you will have an understanding of data binding features in hybrid applications.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)].  \n  \n-   Access to the                          Northwind                          sample database running on Microsoft SQL Server.  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n  \n#### To create and set up the project  \n  \n1.  Create a WPF Application project named                                  `WPFWithWFAndDatabinding`.  \n  \n2.  In Solution Explorer, add references to the following assemblies.  \n  \n    -   WindowsFormsIntegration  \n  \n    -   System.Windows.Forms  \n  \n3.  Open MainWindow.xaml in the                                  [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n4.  In the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window> element, add the following                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] namespaces mapping.  \n  \n    ```xaml  \n  \n    xmlns:wf=\"clr-namespace:System.Windows.Forms;assembly=System.Windows.Forms\"  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Name the default                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element                                  `mainGrid` by assigning the                                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#8)]  \n  \n## Defining the Data Template  \n The master list of customers is displayed in a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The following code example defines a                  <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> object named                  `ListItemsTemplate` that controls the visual tree of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. This                  <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> is assigned to the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control's                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemTemplate%2A> property.  \n  \n#### To define the data template  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#3)]  \n  \n## Specifying the Form Layout  \n The layout of the form is defined by a grid with three rows and three columns.                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> controls are provided to identify each column in the Customers table.  \n  \n#### To set up the Grid layout  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#4)]  \n  \n#### To set up the Label controls  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#5)]  \n  \n## Specifying Data Bindings  \n The master list of customers is displayed in a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The attached                  `ListItemsTemplate` binds a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control to the                  `ContactName` field from the database.  \n  \n The details of each customer record are displayed in several                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls.  \n  \n#### To specify data bindings  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     The                                  <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> class binds the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls to the appropriate fields in the database.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#6)]  \n  \n## Displaying Data by Using Interoperation  \n The orders corresponding to the selected customer are displayed in a                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView?displayProperty=fullName> control named                  `dataGridView1`. The                  `dataGridView1` control is bound to the data source in the code-behind file. A                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control is the parent of this                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control.  \n  \n#### To display data in the DataGridView control  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#7)]  \n  \n## Adding the Data Source to the Project  \n With                  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], you can easily add a data source to your project. This procedure adds a strongly typed data set to your project. Several other support classes, such as table adapters for each of the chosen tables, are also added.  \n  \n#### To add the data source  \n  \n1.  From the                                  **Data** menu, select                                  **Add New Data Source**.  \n  \n2.  In the                                  **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, create a connection to the Northwind database by using a dataset. For more information, see                                  [How to: Connect to Data in a Database](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6c56e54e-8834-4297-85aa-cc1a443ba556).  \n  \n3.  When you are prompted by the                                  **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, save the connection string as                                  `NorthwindConnectionString`.  \n  \n4.  When you are prompted to choose your database objects, select the                                  `Customers` and                                  `Orders` tables, and name the generated data set                                  `NorthwindDataSet`.  \n  \n## Binding to the Data Source  \n The                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource?displayProperty=fullName> component provides a uniform interface for the application's data source. Binding to the data source is implemented in the code-behind file.  \n  \n#### To bind to the data source  \n  \n1.  Open the code-behind file, which is named MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs.  \n  \n2.  Copy the following code into the                                  `MainWindow` class definition.  \n  \n     This code declares the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component and associated helper classes that connect to the database.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#11)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#11)]  \n  \n3.  Copy the following code into the constructor.  \n  \n     This code creates and initializes the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#12)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#12)]  \n  \n4.  Open MainWindow.xaml.  \n  \n5.  In Design view or XAML view, select the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window> element.  \n  \n6.  In the Properties window, click the                                  **Events** tab.  \n  \n7.  Double-click the                                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.  \n  \n8.  Copy the following code into the                                  <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler.  \n  \n     This code assigns the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component as the data context and populates the                                  `Customers` and                                  `Orders` adapter objects.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#13)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#13)]  \n  \n9. Copy the following code into the                                  `MainWindow` class definition.  \n  \n     This method handles the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionView.CurrentChanged> event and updates the current item of the data binding.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#14)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#14)]  \n  \n10.
