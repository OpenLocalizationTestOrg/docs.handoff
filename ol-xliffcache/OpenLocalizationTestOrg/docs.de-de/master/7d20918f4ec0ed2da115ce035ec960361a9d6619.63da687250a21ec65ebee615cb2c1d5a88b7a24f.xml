You can use tracing instead of a debugger to understand how an application is behaving, or why it faults. You can also correlate faults and processing across components to provide an end-to-end experience.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] outputs the following data for diagnostic tracing:  \n  \n-   Traces for process milestones across all components of the applications, such as operation calls, code exceptions, warnings and other significant processing events.\"  \n  \n-   Windows error events when the tracing feature malfunctions.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Configuring Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/configuring-tracing.md)  \n  \n This topic describes how you can configure tracing at different levels to suit your specific need.  \n  \n [End-to-End Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing.md)  \n  \n This section describes how you can use Activity Tracing and Propagation for end-to-end correlation to assist debugging.  \n  \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)  \n  \n This section describes how you can use tracing to debug your application.  \n  \n [Security Concerns and Useful Tips for Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/security-concerns-and-useful-tips-for-tracing.md)  \n  \n This topic describes how you can protect sensitive information from being exposed, as well as useful tips when using WebHost.  \n  \n [Traces Reference](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/traces-reference.md)  \n  \n This topic lists all the traces generated by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,328],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Tracing | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
