Create your assembly. For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md).  \n  \n2.  Assign a strong name to your assembly. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md).  \n  \n3.  Assign version information to your assembly. For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/51ket42z).  \n  \n4.  Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md).  \n  \n5.  Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications.
