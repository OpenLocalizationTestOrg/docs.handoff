elements.  \n  \n### Attributes  \n None.  \n  \n### Child Elements  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|[\\<state>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/states.md)|A subscribed state from the tracked workflow instance when the tracking record is created.|  \n  \n### Parent Elements  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|[\\<workflowInstanceQuery>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/workflowinstancequery.md)|A query that tracks workflow instance life cycle changes such as a started or completed event.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The returned records are filtered by the states in this collection.  \n  \n Possible state values are described in the following table.  \n  \n|State|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|Aborted|The workflow instance is aborted.|  \n|Completed|The workflow instance is completed.|  \n|Deleted|The workflow instance is deleted.|  \n|Idle|The workflow instance is idle.|  \n|Persisted|The workflow instance is persisted.|  \n|Resumed|The workflow instance is resumed.|  \n|Started|The workflow instance is started.|  \n|UnhandledException|The workflow instance encountered an unhandled exception.|  \n|Unloaded|The workflow instance is unloaded.|  \n|Canceled|The workflow instance is canceled.|  \n|Suspended|The workflow instance is suspended.|  \n|Terminated|The workflow instance is terminated.|  \n|Unsuspended|The workflow instance is unsuspended.|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following configuration subscribes to workflow instance-level tracking records for the `Started` instance state using this query.  \n  \n```xml  \n<workflowInstanceQueries>  \n    <workflowInstanceQuery>  \n      <states>  \n        <state name=\"Started\"/>  \n      </states>  \n    </workflowInstanceQuery>  \n</workflowInstanceQueries>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
