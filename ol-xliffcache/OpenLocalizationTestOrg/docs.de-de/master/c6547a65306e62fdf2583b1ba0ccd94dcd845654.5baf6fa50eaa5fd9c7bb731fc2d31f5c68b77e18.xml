This topic discusses methods for collection of ink in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)].  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n To use the following examples, you must first install [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu2005](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu2005-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfxsdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfxsdk-md.md)]. You should also understand how to write applications for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. For more information about getting started with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)], see [Walkthrough: My First WPF Desktop Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/getting-started/walkthrough-my-first-wpf-desktop-application.md).  \n  \n## Using the InkCanvas Element  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element provides the easiest way to collect ink in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element is similar to the [Microsoft.Ink.InkOverlay](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.ink.inkoverlay\\(v=vs.90\\).aspx) object from the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_tpclssdk](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-tpclssdk-md.md)] and earlier versions.  \n  \n Use an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> element to receive and display ink input. You commonly input ink through the use of a stylus, which interacts with a digitizer to produce ink strokes. In addition, a mouse can be used in place of a stylus. The created strokes are represented as <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke> objects, and they can be manipulated both programmatically and by user input. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> enables users to select, modify, or delete an existing <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke>.  \n  \n By using XAML, you can set up ink collection as easily as adding an `InkCanvas` element to your tree. The following example adds an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> to a default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] project created in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu2005](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu2005-md.md)].  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#6)]  \n  \n The `InkCanvas` element can also contain child elements, making it possible to add ink annotation capabilities to almost any type of XAML element. For example, to add inking capabilities to a text element, simply make it a child of an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#5)]  \n  \n Adding support for marking up an image with ink is just as easy.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DigitalInkTopics#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window2.xaml#7)]  \n  \n### InkCollection Modes  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> provides support for various input modes through its <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.EditingMode%2A> property.  \n  \n### Manipulating Ink  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> provides support for many ink editing operations. For example, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> supports back-of-pen erase with no additional code needed to add the functionality to the element.  \n  \n#### Selection  \n Setting selection mode is as simple as setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvasEditingMode> property to **Select**. The following code sets the editing mode based on the value of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox>:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#8)]  \n  \n#### DrawingAttributes  \n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke.DrawingAttributes%2A> property to change the appearance of ink strokes. For instance, the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes.Color%2A> member of <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes> sets the color of the rendered <xref:System.Windows.Ink.Stroke>. The following example changes the color of the selected strokes to red.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DigitalInkTopics#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[DigitalInkTopics#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DigitalInkTopics/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#9)]  \n  \n### DefaultDrawingAttributes  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> property provides access to properties such as the height, width, and color of the strokes to be created in an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>. Once you change the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A>, all future strokes entered into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> are rendered with the new property values.  \n  \n In addition to modifying the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> in the code-behind file, you can use XAML syntax for specifying <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas.DefaultDrawingAttributes%2A> properties. The following XAML code demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes.Color%2A> property. To use this code, create a new [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] project called \"HelloInkCanvas\" in Visual Studio 2005. Replace the code in the Window1.xaml file with the following code.  \n  \n [!code-xml[HelloInkCanvas#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HelloInkCanvas/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n Next, add the following button event handlers to the code behind file, inside the Window1 class.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HelloInkCanvas#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HelloInkCanvas/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#2)]  \n  \n After copying this code, press **F5** in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 to run the program in the debugger.  \n  \n Notice how the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> places the buttons on top of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>. If you try to ink over the top of the buttons, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> collects and renders the ink behind the buttons. This is because the buttons are siblings of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas> as opposed to children. Also, the buttons are higher in the z-order, so the ink is rendered behind them.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Ink.DrawingAttributes>   \n
