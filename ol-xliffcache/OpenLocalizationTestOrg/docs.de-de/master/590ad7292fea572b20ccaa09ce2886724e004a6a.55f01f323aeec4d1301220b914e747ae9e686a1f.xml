Often localizers need to re-size and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called `auto layout`.  \n  \n The following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text. Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to `Auto`; therefore the cell that contains the button with an image adjusts to fit the image. Because the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element can adjust to its content it can be useful when taking the automatic layout approach to designing applications that can be localized.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use a grid.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[LocalizationGrid#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationGrid/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the output of the code sample.  \n  \n ![Grid example](./media/glob-grid.png \"glob_grid\")  \nGrid  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Use Automatic Layout Overview](use-automatic-layout-overview.md)\n- [Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button](how-to-use-automatic-layout-to-create-a-button.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,220],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"grids [WPF], automatic layout\"\n  - \"automatic layout [WPF], grid use\"\nms.assetid: ab9de407-e0c1-4047-bdf0-24951bf73879","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[227,266],"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","linkify":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use a Grid for Automatic Layout","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"This example describes how to use a grid in the automatic layout approach to creating a localizable application.","pos":[267,379]},{"content":"Localization of a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> can be a time consuming process.","pos":[386,502],"source":"Localization of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process."},{"content":"Often localizers need to re-size and reposition elements in addition to translating text.","pos":[503,592]},{"content":"In the past each language that a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> was adapted for required adjustment.","pos":[593,730],"source":" In the past each language that a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment."},{"content":"Now with the capabilities of <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment.","pos":[731,900],"source":" Now with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment."},{"content":"The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called <ph id=\"ph1\">`auto layout`</ph>.","pos":[901,1012],"source":" The approach to writing applications that can be more easily re-sized and repositioned is called `auto layout`."},{"content":"The following <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text.","pos":[1019,1171],"source":"The following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text."},{"content":"Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Auto`</ph>;
