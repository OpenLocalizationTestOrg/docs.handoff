In the case of a unary operator, the sole operand must be of the type of that class or structure.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33020  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the parameter type to the type of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.  \n  \n-   If you want to take one data type as a parameter and return a different data type as the result of the operation, define a conversion operator instead.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,239],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '<typename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc33020\"\n  - \"bc33020\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33020\"\nms.assetid: 9c2c2c5b-6f18-49d2-bd6e-e735a6bced77","nodes":[{"content":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '<typename>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,78],"content":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;typename&gt;</ph>'","source":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '<typename>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[246,325],"content":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '\\<typename>'","linkify":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '\\<typename>'","nodes":[{"content":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>typename&gt;'","pos":[0,79],"source":"Parameter type of this unary operator must be the containing type '\\<typename>'"}]},{"content":"A definition of a unary operator specifies a parameter with a type other than that of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.","pos":[326,468]},{"content":"When you define an operator in a class or structure, at least one of the parameters must be of the type of that class or structure.","pos":[475,606]},{"content":"In the case of a unary operator, the sole operand must be of the type of that class or structure.","pos":[607,704]},{"pos":[711,732],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33020","source":"**Error ID:** BC33020"},{"pos":[741,762],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Change the parameter type to the type of the class or structure in which the operator is defined.","pos":[772,869]},{"content":"If you want to take one data type as a parameter and return a different data type as the result of the operation, define a conversion operator instead.","pos":[879,1030]},{"pos":[1039,1047],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1051,1162],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[1165,1257],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1260,1384],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define an Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1387,1531],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define a Conversion Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)"}]}
