The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control makes this easy by exposing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError> event, which is raised when the data store detects a constraint violation or a broken business rule.  \n  \n In this walkthrough, you will retrieve rows from the `Customers` table in the Northwind sample database and display them in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. When a duplicate `CustomerID` value is detected in a new row or an edited existing row, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError> event will occur, which will be handled by displaying a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> that describes the exception.  \n  \n To copy the code in this topic as a single listing, see [How to: Handle Errors That Occur During Data Entry in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/handle-errors-that-occur-during-data-entry-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n In order to complete this walkthrough, you will need:  \n  \n-   Access to a server that has the Northwind SQL Server sample database.  \n  \n## Creating the Form  \n  \n#### To handle data-entry errors in the DataGridView control  \n  \n1.  Create a class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> and contains a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n     The following code example provides basic initialization and includes a `Main` method.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#01](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#01)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#01](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#01)]  \n    [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#02](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#02)]\n    [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#02](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#02)]  \n  \n2.  Implement a method in your form's class definition for handling the details of connecting to the database.  \n  \n     This code example uses a `GetData` method that returns a populated <xref:System.Data.DataTable> object. Be sure that you set the `connectionString` variable to a value that is appropriate for your database.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#30](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#30)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#30](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#30)]  \n  \n3.  Implement a handler for your form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event that initializes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> and sets up the data binding.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#10)]  \n  \n4.  Handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError> event on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>.  \n  \n     If the context for the error is a commit operation, display the error in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox>.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#20](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/CS/errorhandling.cs#20)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError#20](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataError/VB/errorhandling.vb#20)]  \n  \n## Testing the Application  \n You can now test the form to make sure it behaves as expected.  \n  \n#### To test the form  \n  \n-   Press F5 to run the application.  \n  \n     You will see a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control filled with data from the Customers table. If you enter a duplicate value for `CustomerID` and commit the edit, the cell value will revert automatically and you will see a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox> that displays the data entry error.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n This application gives you a basic understanding of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's capabilities. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control in several ways:  \n  \n-   Change border and header styles. For more information, see [How to: Change the Border and Gridline Styles in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/change-the-border-and-gridline-styles-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n-   Enable or restrict user input to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For more information, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-datagridview.md), and [How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-make-columns-read-only-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Validate user input to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Validating Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-validating-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Handle very large data sets using virtual mode. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Virtual Mode in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/implementing-virtual-mode-wf-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Customize the appearance of cells. For more information, see [How to: Customize the Appearance of Cells in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/customize-the-appearance-of-cells-in-the-datagrid.md) and [How to: Set Default Cell Styles for the Windows Forms DataGridView
