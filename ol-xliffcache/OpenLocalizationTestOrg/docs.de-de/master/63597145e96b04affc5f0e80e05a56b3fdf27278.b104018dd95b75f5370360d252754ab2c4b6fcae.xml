To iterate through an enumeration, you can move it into an array using the <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method. You could also iterate through an enumeration using a `For...Each` statement, using the <xref:System.Enum.GetNames%2A> or <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method to extract the string or numeric value.  \n  \n### To iterate through an enumeration  \n  \n-   Declare an array and convert the enumeration to it with the <xref:System.Enum.GetValues%2A> method before passing the array as you would any other variable. The following example displays each member of the enumeration <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FirstDayOfWeek> as it iterates through the enumeration.  \n  \n
