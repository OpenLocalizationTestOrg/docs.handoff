It is the same as the standard Save File dialog box used by Windows. It inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SaveFileDialog Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/savefiledialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog that users can use to save a file to a specified location.  \n  \n [How to: Save Files Using the SaveFileDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-save-files-using-the-savefiledialog-component.md)  \n Explains how to save a file via an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> component at run time.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> class  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes a set of controls and components that allow users to perform standard interactions with the application or system.  \n  \n [Essential Code for Windows Forms Dialog Boxes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=102575)  \n Discusses the Windows Forms dialog box controls and components and the code necessary for executing their basic functions.
