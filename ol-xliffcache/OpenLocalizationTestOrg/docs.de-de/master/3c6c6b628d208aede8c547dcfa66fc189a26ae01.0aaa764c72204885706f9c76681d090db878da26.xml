A binding contains the following elements:\n\n- The protocol stack determines the security, reliability, and context flow settings to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint.\n\n- The transport determines the underlying transport protocol to use when sending messages to the endpoint, for example, TCP or HTTP.\n\n- The encoding determines the wire encoding to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint. For example, text/XML, binary, or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).\n\n This article presents all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings. If none of these bindings meets the exact criteria for your application, you can create a custom binding. For more information about creating custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](./extending/custom-bindings.md).\n\n A secure and interoperable binding that supports the WS-Federation protocol enables organizations that are in a federation to efficiently authenticate and authorize users.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always select a binding that includes security. By default, all bindings except the [\\<basicHttpBinding>](../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md) element have security enabled. If you do not select a secure binding or disable security, be sure to protect your data in some other manner, such as storing in a secured data center or on an isolated network.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Never use duplex contracts with bindings that do not support security or that have security disabled unless you secure the data by some other means.\n\nThe following bindings ship with WCF:\n\n|Binding|Configuration Element|Description|\n|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>|[\\<basicHttpBinding>](../configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md)|A binding that is suitable for communicating with WS-Basic Profile-conformant Web services, for example, ASP.NET Web services (ASMX)-based services.

This behavior can be overridden using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebSocketTransportUsage> binding setting: WhenDuplex - This is the default value and behaves as described above. Never - This prevents WebSockets from being used. Attempting to use a duplex contract with this setting results in an exception.

Note that this feature requires support for Sessions in the binding.|\n|Encoding|Specifies the wire format of the message. Allowable values include:<br />- Text: for example UTF-8.<br />- Binary<br />- Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM): A method for efficiently encoding binary XML elements within the context of a SOAP envelope.|\n|Streaming|Specifies whether streaming is supported for incoming and outgoing messages. Use the `TransferMode` property on the binding to set the value. The allowable values include:<br />- <xref:System.ServiceModel.TransferMode.Buffered>: The request and response messages are both buffered.<br />- <xref:System.ServiceModel.TransferMode.Streamed>: The request and response messages are both streamed.<br />- <xref:System.ServiceModel.TransferMode.StreamedRequest>: The request message is streamed and the response message is buffered.<br />- <xref:System.ServiceModel.TransferMode.StreamedResponse>: The request message is buffered and the response message is streamed.|\n\n## See also\n\n- [Endpoint Creation Overview](endpoint-creation-overview.md)\n- [Using Bindings to Configure Services and Clients](using-bindings-to-configure-services-and-clients.md)\n- [Basic WCF Programming](basic-wcf-programming.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,271],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System-provided bindings\"\ndescription: \"Learn about all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings.\"\nms.date: \"06/05/2018\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"bindings [WCF], system-provided\"\nms.assetid: 2c243746-45ce-4588-995e-c17126a579a6","nodes":[{"content":"System-provided bindings","nodes":[{"pos":[0,24],"content":"System-provided bindings","nodes":[{"content":"System-provided bindings","pos":[0,24]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"Learn about all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,87],"content":"Learn about all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings.","nodes":[{"content":"Learn about all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings.","pos":[0,87]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[278,302],"content":"System-provided bindings","linkify":"System-provided bindings","nodes":[{"content":"System-provided bindings","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Bindings specify the communication mechanism to use when talking to an endpoint and indicate how to connect to an endpoint.","pos":[304,427]},{"content":"A binding contains the following elements:","pos":[428,470]},{"content":"The protocol stack determines the security, reliability, and context flow settings to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint.","pos":[474,607]},{"content":"The transport determines the underlying transport protocol to use when sending messages to the endpoint, for example, TCP or HTTP.","pos":[611,741]},{"content":"The encoding determines the wire encoding to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint.","pos":[745,837]},{"content":"For example, text/XML, binary, or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).","pos":[838,923]},{"content":"This article presents all of the system-provided Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) bindings.","pos":[926,1023]},{"content":"If none of these bindings meets the exact criteria for your application, you can create a custom binding.","pos":[1024,1129]},{"content":"For more information about creating custom bindings, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Custom Bindings<ept id=\"p1\">](./extending/custom-bindings.md)</ept>.","pos":[1130,1237],"source":" For more information about creating custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](./extending/custom-bindings.md)."},{"content":"A secure and interoperable binding that supports the WS-Federation protocol enables organizations that are in a federation to efficiently authenticate and authorize users.","pos":[1240,1411]},{"pos":[1415,1799],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\nAlways select a binding that includes security.
