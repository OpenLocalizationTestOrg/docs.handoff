In addition, with its support for the WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT) protocol, applications can flow transactions to Web services built using either [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] or third-party technology.  \n  \n In a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service or application, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] transaction features provide attributes and configuration for declaratively specifying how and when the infrastructure should create, flow, and synchronize transactions.  \n  \n## System.Transactions Transactions  \n The <xref:System.Transactions> namespace provides both an explicit programming model based on the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction> class, as well as an implicit programming model using the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> class, in which the infrastructure automatically manages transactions.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to create a transactional application using these two models, see [Writing a Transactional Application](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94947).  \n  \n In a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service or application, <xref:System.Transactions> provides the programming model for creating transactions within a client application and for explicitly interacting with a transaction, when required, within a service.  \n  \n## MSDTC Transactions  \n The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a transaction manager that provides support for distributed transactions.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] the [DTC Programmer's Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94948).  \n  \n In a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service or application, MSDTC provides the infrastructure for the coordination of transactions created within a client or service.","nodes":[{"pos":[4,338],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Transaction Models | Microsoft
