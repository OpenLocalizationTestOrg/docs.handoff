These workflows are typically client workflows but could also be workflow services that are hosted in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>.  \n  \n By default, in a workflow hosted by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, the cache used by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> messaging activities is shared across all workflow instances in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost> (host-level caching). For a client workflow that is not hosted by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, the cache is available only to the workflow instance (instance-level caching). Caching is disabled by default for any send activity in your workflow that has endpoints defined in configuration.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to change the default cache sharing levels and cache settings for the channel factory and channel cache, see [Changing the Cache Sharing Levels for Send Activities](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/changing-the-cache-sharing-levels-for-send-activities.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n In a hosted workflow service, you can specify the factory cache and channel cache settings in the application configuration file. To do so, add a service behavior that contains the cache settings for the factory and channel cache and add this service behavior to your service. The following example shows the contents of a configuration file that contains the **MyChannelCacheBehavior**  service behavior with the custom factory cache and channel cache settings. This service behavior is added to the service through the **behaviorConfiguarion** attribute.  \n  \n```  \n  \n<configuration>    \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <!-- List of other config sections here -->   \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"MyChannelCacheBehavior\">  \n          <sendMessageChannelCache allowUnsafeCaching =\"false\" >  \n            <!-- Control only the host level settings -->   \n            <factorySettings maxItemsInCache = \"8\" idleTimeout = \"00:05:00\" leaseTimeout=\"10:00:00\" />  \n            <channelSettings maxItemsInCache = \"32\" idleTimeout = \"00:05:00\" leaseTimeout=\"00:06:00\" />  \n          </sendMessageChannelCache>  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    <services>  \n      <service name=\"MyService\" behaviorConfiguration=\"MyChannelCacheBehavior\" />  \n    </services>  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n
