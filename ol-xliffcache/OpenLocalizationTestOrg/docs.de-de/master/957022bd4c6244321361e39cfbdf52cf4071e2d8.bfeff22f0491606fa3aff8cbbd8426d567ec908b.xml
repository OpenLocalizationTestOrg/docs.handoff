Each text line is stored into the string `line` and displayed on the screen.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \nint counter = 0;  \nstring line;  \n  \n// Read the file and display it line by line.  \nSystem.IO.StreamReader file =   \n    new System.IO.StreamReader(@\"c:\\test.txt\");  \nwhile((line = file.ReadLine()) != null)  \n{  \n    System.Console.WriteLine (line);  \n    counter++;  \n}  \n  \nfile.Close();  \nSystem.Console.WriteLine(\"There were {0} lines.\", counter);  \n// Suspend the screen.  \nSystem.Console.ReadLine();  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Copy the code and paste it into the `Main` method of a console application.  \n  \n Replace `\"c:\\test.txt\"` with the actual file name.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The file may not exist.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file. For example, the file `myFile.cs` may not be a C# source file.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,84],"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[622,677],"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","linkify":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"This example reads the contents of a text file, one line at a time, into a string using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReadLine`</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`StreamReader`</ph> class.","pos":[678,816],"source":"This example reads the contents of a text file, one line at a time, into a string using the `ReadLine` method of the `StreamReader` class."},{"content":"Each text line is stored into the string <ph id=\"ph1\">`line`</ph> and displayed on the screen.","pos":[817,893],"source":" Each text line is stored into the string `line` and displayed on the screen."},{"pos":[902,909],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1342,1360],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1364,1439],"content":"Copy the code and paste it into the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method of a console application.","source":"Copy the code and paste it into the `Main` method of a console application."},{"pos":[1446,1496],"content":"Replace <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"c:\\test.txt\"`</ph> with the actual file name.","source":"Replace `\"c:\\test.txt\"` with the actual file name."},{"pos":[1505,1523],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1527,1575]},{"content":"The file may not exist.","pos":[1585,1608]},{"pos":[1617,1640],"content":".NET Framework Security","linkify":".NET Framework Security","nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Security","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file.","pos":[1644,1727]},{"content":"For example, the file <ph id=\"ph1\">`myFile.cs`</ph> may not be a C# source file.","pos":[1728,1790],"source":" For example, the file `myFile.cs` may not be a C# source file."},{"pos":[1799,1807],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1856,1924],"source":" [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1927,2037],"source":" [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)"}]}
