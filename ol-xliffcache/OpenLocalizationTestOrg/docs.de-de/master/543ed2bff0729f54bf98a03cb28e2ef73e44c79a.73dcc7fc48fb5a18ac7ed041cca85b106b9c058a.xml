The query partitions the source into tasks that are executed asynchronously on multiple threads. The order in which each task completes depends not only on the amount of work involved to process the elements in the partition, but also on external factors such as how the operating system schedules each thread. This example is intended to demonstrate usage, and might not run faster than the equivalent sequential LINQ to Objects query. For more information about speedup, see [Understanding Speedup in PLINQ](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/understanding-speedup-in-plinq.md). For more information about how to preserve the ordering of elements in a query, see [How to: Control Ordering in a PLINQ Query](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/how-to-control-ordering-in-a-plinq-query.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,418],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"PLINQ queries, how to create\"\nms.assetid: 983b4213-bddd-4a44-9262-cbe59186df4c\ncaps.latest.revision: 14\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[425,472],"content":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query","linkify":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create and Execute a Simple PLINQ Query","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to create a simple Parallel LINQ query by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsParallel%2A&gt;</ph> extension method on the source sequence, and executing the query by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.ForAll%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[473,742],"source":"The following example shows how to create a simple Parallel LINQ query by using the <xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.AsParallel%2A> extension method on the source sequence, and executing the query by using the <xref:System.Linq.ParallelEnumerable.ForAll%2A> method."},{"pos":[750,1031],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation uses lambda expressions to define delegates in PLINQ.
