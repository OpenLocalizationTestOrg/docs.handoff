You can use them anywhere a delegate value is expected, that is, wherever an anonymous method can be used. The following example shows how to use a lambda expression in a Windows Forms event handler. Notice that the types of the inputs (<xref:System.Object> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs>) are inferred by the compiler and do not have to be explicitly given in the lambda input parameters.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic partial class Form1 : Form  \n{  \n    public Form1()  \n    {  \n        InitializeComponent();  \n        // Use a lambda expression to define an event handler.  \n       this.Click += (s, e) => { MessageBox.Show(((MouseEventArgs)e).Location.ToString());};  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md)\n- [Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md)\n- [Language Integrated Query (LINQ))](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,234],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ - C# Programming Guide\"\nms.custom: seodec18\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"lambda expressions [C#], outside LINQ\"\nms.assetid: 2b519274-6ee4-4455-ab2e-aed67dbfd07c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"pos":[0,66],"content":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ - C# Programming Guide","pos":[0,66]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[241,307],"content":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Lambda Expressions Outside LINQ (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"Lambda expressions are not limited to <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)]</ph> queries.","pos":[308,404],"source":"Lambda expressions are not limited to [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](~/includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] queries."},{"content":"You can use them anywhere a delegate value is expected, that is, wherever an anonymous method can be used.","pos":[405,511]},{"content":"The following example shows how to use a lambda expression in a Windows Forms event handler.","pos":[512,604]},{"content":"Notice that the types of the inputs (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Object&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs&gt;</ph>) are inferred by the compiler and do not have to be explicitly given in the lambda input parameters.","pos":[605,810],"source":" Notice that the types of the inputs (<xref:System.Object> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs>) are inferred by the compiler and do not have to be explicitly given in the lambda input parameters."},{"pos":[819,826],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1130,1138],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1142,1252],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md)</ept>","source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md)"},{"pos":[1255,1363],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Anonymous Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md)"},{"pos":[1366,1459],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language Integrated Query (LINQ))<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Language Integrated Query (LINQ))](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)"}]}
