This technology allows them to take advantage of the runtime security protections provided by Code Access Security, provided that they are digitally signed with a trusted certificate. The certificate used to sign the ClickOnce application must reside in the Trusted Publisher store, and the local security policy on the client machine must be configured to grant Full Trust permissions to applications signed with the publisher's certificate.  \n  \n For information on configuring ClickOnce applications and trusted publishers, see [Configuring ClickOnce Trusted Publishers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94774).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Trusted Application Deployment Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94775)   \n [ClickOnce Deployment for Windows Forms Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94776)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[368,409],"content":"Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce","linkify":"Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce","nodes":[{"content":"Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"Client applications using <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> may be deployed using ClickOnce technology.","pos":[410,532],"source":"Client applications using [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] may be deployed using ClickOnce technology."},{"content":"This technology allows them to take advantage of the runtime security protections provided by Code Access Security, provided that they are digitally signed with a trusted certificate.","pos":[533,716]},{"content":"The certificate used to sign the ClickOnce application must reside in the Trusted Publisher store, and the local security policy on the client machine must be configured to grant Full Trust permissions to applications signed with the publisher's certificate.","pos":[717,975]},{"pos":[982,1153],"content":"For information on configuring ClickOnce applications and trusted publishers, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Configuring ClickOnce Trusted Publishers<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94774)</ept>.","source":"For information on configuring ClickOnce applications and trusted publishers, see [Configuring ClickOnce Trusted Publishers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94774)."},{"pos":[1162,1170],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Trusted Application Deployment Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94775)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1174,1262],"source":"[Trusted Application Deployment Overview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94775) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>ClickOnce Deployment for Windows Forms Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94776)</ept>","pos":[1265,1365],"source":" [ClickOnce Deployment for Windows Forms Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94776)"}]}
