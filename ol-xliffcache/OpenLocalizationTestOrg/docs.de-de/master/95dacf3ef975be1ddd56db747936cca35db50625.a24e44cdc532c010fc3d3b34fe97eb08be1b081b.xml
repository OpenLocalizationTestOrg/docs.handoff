The topics in this section show you how this is done.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n [Custom Credential and Credential Validation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-credential-and-credential-validation.md)  \n Explains how the Identity Model is used when validating custom credentials.  \n  \n [Custom Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-tokens.md)  \n Issued tokens from a Security Token Service (STS) are typically SAML tokens. This topic explains how to create a custom token type.  \n  \n [Custom Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-authorization.md)  \n Explains how to implement custom authorization.  \n  \n [Overriding the Identity of a Service for Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/overriding-the-identity-of-a-service-for-authentication.md)  \n Describes how to override the identity of a service for authentication.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Custom Client Identity Verifier](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-client-identity-verifier.md)  \n Demonstrates how to validate a custom endpoint identity.  \n  \n [How to: Use Separate X.509 Certificates for Signing and Encryption](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-use-separate-x-509-certificates-for-signing-and-encryption.md)  \n Messages are typically signed and encrypted with a single certificate. This topic explains how two certificates can be used, when required.  \n  \n [How to: Change the Cryptographic Provider for an X.509 Certificate's Private Key](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/change-cryptographic-provider-x509-certificate-private-key.md)  \n Explains how to change the cryptographic provider used to provide an X.509 certificate's private key and how to integrate the provider into the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager>
