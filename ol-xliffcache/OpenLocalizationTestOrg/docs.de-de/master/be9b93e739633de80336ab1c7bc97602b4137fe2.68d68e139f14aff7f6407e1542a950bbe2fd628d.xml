[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] text rendering typically offers better performance and more accurate text measuring than [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class are not supported for printing. When printing, always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to draw text on multiple lines within a rectangle using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples/CS/Form1.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples#7](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples/VB/Form1.vb#7)]  \n  \n To render text with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class, you need an <xref:System.Drawing.IDeviceContext>, such as a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> and a <xref:System.Drawing.Font>, a location to draw the text, and the color in which it should be drawn. Optionally, you can specify the text formatting by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextFormatFlags> enumeration.  \n  \n For more information about obtaining a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, see [How to: Create Graphics Objects for Drawing](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-graphics-objects-for-drawing.md).
