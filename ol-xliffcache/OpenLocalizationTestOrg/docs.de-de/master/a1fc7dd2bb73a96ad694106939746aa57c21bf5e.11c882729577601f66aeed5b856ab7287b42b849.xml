The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects to a device, such as a screen or printer.  \n  \n### To print graphics  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  \n  \n2.  In the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler, use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class to instruct the printer on what kind of graphics to print.  \n  \n     The following code example shows an event handler used to create a blue ellipse within a bounding rectangle. The rectangle has the following location and dimensions: beginning at 100, 150 with a width of 250 and a height of 250.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  \n       e.Graphics.FillEllipse(Brushes.Blue, New Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250))  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Blue,   \n         new Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250));  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Blue,  \n             Rectangle(100, 150, 250, 250));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.Brush>   \n [Windows Forms Print Support](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[494,533],"content":"How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Frequently, you will want to print graphics in your Windows-based application.","pos":[534,612]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class provides methods for drawing objects to a device, such as a screen or printer.","pos":[613,732],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides methods for drawing objects to a device, such as a screen or printer."},{"pos":[742,759],"content":"To print graphics","linkify":"To print graphics","nodes":[{"content":"To print graphics","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Add a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component to your form.","pos":[769,843],"source":"Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form."},{"content":"In the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage&gt;</ph> event handler, use the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A&gt;</ph> property of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs&gt;</ph> class to instruct the printer on what kind of graphics to print.","pos":[853,1130],"source":"In the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler, use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class to instruct the printer on what kind of graphics to print."},{"content":"The following code example shows an event handler used to create a blue ellipse within a bounding rectangle.","pos":[1141,1249]},{"content":"The rectangle has the following location and dimensions: beginning at 100, 150 with a width of 250 and a height of 250.","pos":[1250,1369]},{"pos":[2205,2400],"content":"(<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]</ph>) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.","source":"([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler."},{"pos":[2763,2771],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph>","pos":[2775,2805],"source":"<xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> "},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Brush&gt;</ph>","pos":[2810,2837],"source":" <xref:System.Drawing.Brush> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Windows Forms Print Support<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)</ept>","pos":[2841,2948],"source":" [Windows Forms Print Support](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)"}]}
