Each instance is instantiated on demand. You can access these Web services through the properties of the `My.WebServices` object. The name of the property is the same as the name of the Web service that the property accesses. Any class that inherits from <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol> is a Web service.  \n  \n## Tasks  \n The following table lists possible ways to access Web services referenced by an application.  \n  \n|To|See|  \n|---|---|   \n|Call a Web service|[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)|  \n|Call a Web service asynchronously and handle an event when it completes|[How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)|  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,286],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Web services [Visual Basic], My.WebServices object\"\n  - \"My.WebServices object\"\n  - \"applications [Visual Basic], Web services\"\nms.assetid: 8ad5405b-e771-42b1-82d3-ce97af2cea9e","nodes":[{"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,49]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[293,342],"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.WebServices`</ph> object provides an instance of each Web service referenced by the current project.","pos":[343,446],"source":"The `My.WebServices` object provides an instance of each Web service referenced by the current project."},{"content":"Each instance is instantiated on demand.","pos":[447,487]},{"content":"You can access these Web services through the properties of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.WebServices`</ph> object.","pos":[488,576],"source":" You can access these Web services through the properties of the `My.WebServices` object."},{"content":"The name of the property is the same as the name of the Web service that the property accesses.","pos":[577,672]},{"content":"Any class that inherits from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol&gt;</ph> is a Web service.","pos":[673,779],"source":" Any class that inherits from <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol> is a Web service."},{"pos":[788,793],"content":"Tasks","linkify":"Tasks","nodes":[{"content":"Tasks","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"The following table lists possible ways to access Web services referenced by an application.","pos":[797,889]},{"content":"To","pos":[896,898]},{"content":"See","pos":[899,902]},{"content":"Call a Web service","pos":[920,938]},{"pos":[939,1037],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>My.WebServices Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)</ept>","source":"[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)"},{"content":"Call a Web service asynchronously and handle an event when it completes","pos":[1042,1113]},{"pos":[1114,1252],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)"},{"pos":[1262,1270],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1274,1372],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>My.WebServices Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)</ept>","source":"[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)"}]}
