Synchronous server sockets are not suitable for applications that make heavy use of the network in their operation, but they can be suitable for simple network applications.  \n  \n After a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> is set to listen on an endpoint using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Listen%2A> methods, it is ready to accept incoming connection requests using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Accept%2A> method. The application is suspended until a connection request is received when the **Accept** method is called.  \n  \n When a connection request is received, **Accept** returns a new **Socket** instance that is associated with the connecting client. The following example reads data from the client, displays it on the console, and echoes the data back to the client. The **Socket** does not specify any messaging protocol, so the string \"\\<EOF>\" marks the end of the message data. It assumes that a **Socket** named `listener` has been initialized and bound to an endpoint.  \n  \n```vb  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Waiting for a connection...\")  \nDim handler As Socket = listener.Accept()  \nDim data As String = Nothing  \n  \nWhile True  \n    bytes = New Byte(1024) {}  \n    Dim bytesRec As Integer = handler.Receive(bytes)  \n    data += Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes, 0, bytesRec)  \n    If data.IndexOf(\"<EOF>\") > - 1 Then  \n        Exit While  \n    End If  \nEnd While  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Text received : {0}\", data)  \n  \nDim msg As Byte() = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data)  \nhandler.Send(msg)  \nhandler.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both)  \nhandler.Close()  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Waiting for a connection...\");  \nSocket handler = listener.Accept();  \nString data = null;  \n  \nwhile (true) {  \n    bytes = new byte[1024];  \n    int bytesRec = handler.Receive(bytes);  \n    data += Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes,0,bytesRec);  \n    if (data.IndexOf(\"<EOF>\") > -1) {  \n        break;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine( \"Text received : {0}\", data);  \n  \nbyte[] msg = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);  \nhandler.Send(msg);  \nhandler.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both);  \nhandler.Close();  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using an Asynchronous Server Socket](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-an-asynchronous-server-socket.md)   \n [Synchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md)   \n [Listening with Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/listening-with-sockets.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[768,801],"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket","linkify":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket","nodes":[{"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Synchronous server sockets suspend the execution of the application until a connection request is received on the socket.","pos":[802,923]},{"content":"Synchronous server sockets are not suitable for applications that make heavy use of the network in their operation, but they can be suitable for simple network applications.","pos":[924,1097]},{"content":"After a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket&gt;</ph> is set to listen on an endpoint using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Listen%2A&gt;</ph> methods, it is ready to accept incoming connection requests using the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Accept%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1104,1395],"source":"After a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> is set to listen on an endpoint using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Listen%2A> methods, it is ready to accept incoming connection requests using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Accept%2A> method."},{"content":"The application is suspended until a connection request is received when the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Accept<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> method is called.","pos":[1396,1501],"source":" The application is suspended until a connection request is received when the **Accept** method is called."},{"content":"When a connection request is received, <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Accept<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> returns a new <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> instance that is associated with the connecting client.","pos":[1508,1638],"source":"When a connection request is received, **Accept** returns a new **Socket** instance that is associated with the connecting client."},{"content":"The following example reads data from the client, displays it on the console, and echoes the data back to the client.","pos":[1639,1756]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> does not specify any messaging protocol, so the string \"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>EOF&gt;\" marks the end of the message data.","pos":[1757,1870],"source":" The **Socket** does not specify any messaging protocol, so the string \"\\<EOF>\" marks the end of the message data."},{"content":"It assumes that a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> named <ph id=\"ph1\">`listener`</ph> has been initialized and bound to an endpoint.","pos":[1871,1963],"source":" It assumes that a **Socket** named `listener` has been initialized and bound to an endpoint."},{"pos":[3092,3100],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using an Asynchronous Server Socket<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-an-asynchronous-server-socket.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[3104,3226],"source":"[Using an Asynchronous Server Socket](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-an-asynchronous-server-socket.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Synchronous Server Socket Example<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[3229,3348],"source":" [Synchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Listening with Sockets<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/listening-with-sockets.md)</ept>","pos":[3351,3447],"source":" [Listening with Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/listening-with-sockets.md)"}]}
