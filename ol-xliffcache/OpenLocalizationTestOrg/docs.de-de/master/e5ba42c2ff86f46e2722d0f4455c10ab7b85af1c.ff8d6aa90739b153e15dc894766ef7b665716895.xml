You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n-
