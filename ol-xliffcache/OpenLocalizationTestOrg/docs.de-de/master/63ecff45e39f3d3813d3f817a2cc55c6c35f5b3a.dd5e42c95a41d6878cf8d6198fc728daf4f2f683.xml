Use one of the following options to block your application's main thread while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete:  \n  \n-   Call the asynchronous operations **End**_OperationName_ method. This approach is demonstrated in this topic.  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> returned by the asynchronous operation's **Begin**_OperationName_ method. For an example that demonstrates this approach, see [Blocking Application Execution Using an AsyncWaitHandle](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/blocking-application-execution-using-an-asyncwaithandle.md).  \n  \n Applications that use the **End**_OperationName_ method to block until an asynchronous operation is complete will typically call the **Begin**_OperationName_ method, perform any work that can be done without the results of the operation, and then call **End**_OperationName_.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System information for a user-specified computer. Note that `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic) is passed for the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A>`requestCallback` and `stateObject` parameters because these arguments are not required when using this approach.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[AsyncDesignPattern#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AsyncDesignPattern/CS/Async_EndBlock.cs#1)]\n
