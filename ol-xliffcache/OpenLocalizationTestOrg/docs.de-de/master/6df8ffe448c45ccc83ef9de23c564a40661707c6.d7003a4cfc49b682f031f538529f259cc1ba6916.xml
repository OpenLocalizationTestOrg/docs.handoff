The operands must be of the same type (or the right-hand operand must be implicitly convertible to the type of the left-hand operand).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The assignment operator cannot be overloaded. However, you can define implicit conversion operators for a type, which enable you to use the assignment operator with those types.
