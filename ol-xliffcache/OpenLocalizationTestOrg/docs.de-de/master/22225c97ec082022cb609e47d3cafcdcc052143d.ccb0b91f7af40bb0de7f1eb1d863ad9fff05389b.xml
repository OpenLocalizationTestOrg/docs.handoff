To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To position a control on the design surface of the Windows Forms Designer  \n  \n-   Drag the control to the appropriate location with the mouse.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Select the control and move it with the ARROW keys to position it more precisely. Also, *snaplines* assist you in placing controls precisely on your form. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md).  \n  \n### To position a control using the Properties window  \n  \n1.  Click the control you want to position.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, type values for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property, separated by a comma, to position the control within its container.  \n  \n     The first number (X) is the distance from the left border of the container; the second number (Y) is the distance from the upper border of the container area, measured in pixels.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can expand the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to type the **X** and **Y** values individually.  \n  \n### To position a control programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property of the control to a <xref:System.Drawing.Point>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Location = new Point(100, 100);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Location = Point(100, 100);  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Change the X coordinate of the control's location using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Left = 300  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Left = 300;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Left = 300;  \n    ```  \n  \n### To increment a control's location programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty to increment the X coordinate of the control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Left += 200  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Left += 200;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Left += 200;  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to set a control's X and Y positions simultaneously. To set a position individually, use the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> (**X**) or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Top%2A> (**Y**) subproperty. Do not try to implicitly set the X and Y coordinates of the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure that represents the button's location, because this structure contains a copy of the button's coordinates.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Windows Forms Controls](index.md)\n- [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)\n- [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a TableLayoutPanel](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-tablelayoutpanel.md)\n- [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a FlowLayoutPanel](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-flowlayoutpanel.md)\n- [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)\n- [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)\n- [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)\n- [Windows Forms Controls by Function](windows-forms-controls-by-function.md)\n- [How to: Set the Screen Location of Windows Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/52aha046(v=vs.100))\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,385],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"Location\"\n  - \"Location.Y\"\n  - \"Location.X\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], moving\"\n  - \"snaplines\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], positioning\"\nms.assetid: 4693977e-34a4-4f19-8221-68c3120c2b2b","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","pos":[0,42]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[392,434],"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[435,561],"content":"To position controls, use the Windows Forms Designer, or specify the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A&gt;</ph> property.","source":"To position controls, use the Windows Forms Designer, or specify the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property."},{"pos":[569,914],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
