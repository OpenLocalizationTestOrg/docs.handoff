The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A> property indicates whether the row for new records is present at the bottom of the control, while the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToDeleteRows%2A> property indicates whether rows can be removed. The following code example uses these properties and also sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ReadOnly%2A> property to make the control entirely read-only.  \n  \n There is support for this task in Visual Studio.  Also see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k5c88sw3\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#090](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/CS/datagridviewmisc.cs#090)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#090](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/VB/datagridviewmisc.vb#090)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control named `dataGridView1`.  \n  \n-   References to the <xref:System?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=fullName> assemblies.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ReadOnly%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToDeleteRows%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [Basic Column, Row, and Cell Features in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/basic-column-row-and-cell-features-wf-datagridview-control.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,606],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
