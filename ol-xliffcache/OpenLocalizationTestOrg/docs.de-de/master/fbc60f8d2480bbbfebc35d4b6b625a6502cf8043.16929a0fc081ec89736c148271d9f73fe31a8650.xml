As a result, the `new` keyword cannot be used to create a new <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object. Instead, <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> objects are instantiated either by retrieving information on predefined time zones from the registry or by creating a custom time zone. This topic discusses instantiating a time zone from data stored in the registry. In addition, `static` (`shared` in Visual Basic) properties of the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> class provide access to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the local time zone.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For time zones that are not defined in the registry, you can create custom time zones by calling the overloads of the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.CreateCustomTimeZone%2A> method. Creating a custom time zone is discussed in the [How to: Create time zones without adjustment rules](../../../docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-without-adjustment-rules.md) and [How to: Create time zones with adjustment rules](../../../docs/standard/datetime/create-time-zones-with-adjustment-rules.md) topics. In addition, you can instantiate a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object by restoring it from a serialized string with the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.FromSerializedString%2A> method. Serializing and deserializing a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object is discussed in the [How to: Save time zones to an embedded resource](../../../docs/standard/datetime/save-time-zones-to-an-embedded-resource.md) and [How to: Restore Time Zones from an Embedded Resource](../../../docs/standard/datetime/restore-time-zones-from-an-embedded-resource.md) topics.\n\n## Accessing individual time zones\n\nThe <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> class provides two predefined time zone objects that represent the UTC time and the local time zone. They are available from the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.Utc%2A> and <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.Local%2A> properties, respectively. For instructions on accessing the UTC or local time zones, see [How to: Access the predefined UTC and local time zone objects](../../../docs/standard/datetime/access-utc-and-local.md).\n\nYou can also instantiate a <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object that represents any time zone defined in the registry. For instructions on instantiating a specific time zone object, see [How to: Instantiate a TimeZoneInfo object](../../../docs/standard/datetime/instantiate-time-zone-info.md).\n\n## Time zone identifiers\n\nThe time zone identifier is a key field that uniquely identifies the time zone. While most keys are relatively short, the time zone identifier is comparatively long. In most cases, its value corresponds to the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.StandardName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, which is used to provide the name of the time zone's standard time. However, there are exceptions. The best way to make sure that you supply a valid identifier is to enumerate the time zones available on your system and note their associated identifiers.\n\n## See also\n\n[Dates, times, and time zones](../../../docs/standard/datetime/index.md)\n[How to: Access the predefined UTC and local time zone objects](../../../docs/standard/datetime/access-utc-and-local.md)\n[How to: Instantiate a TimeZoneInfo object](../../../docs/standard/datetime/instantiate-time-zone-info.md)\n[Converting times between time zones](../../../docs/standard/datetime/converting-between-time-zones.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,77],"content":"Finding the time zones defined on a local system | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Finding the time zones defined on a local system | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,65]}]},{"pos":[708,756],"content":"Finding the time zones defined on a local system","linkify":"Finding the time zones defined on a local system","nodes":[{"content":"Finding the time zones defined on a local system","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.TimeZoneInfo&gt;</ph> class does not expose a public constructor.","pos":[758,832],"source":"The <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> class does not expose a public constructor."},{"content":"As a result, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`new`</ph> keyword cannot be used to create a new <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.TimeZoneInfo&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[833,929],"source":" As a result, the `new` keyword cannot be used to create a new <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> object."},{"content":"Instead, <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.TimeZoneInfo&gt;</ph> objects are instantiated either by retrieving information on predefined time zones from the registry or by creating a custom time zone.","pos":[930,1101],"source":" Instead, <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> objects are instantiated either by retrieving information on predefined time zones from the registry or by creating a custom time zone."},{"content":"This topic discusses instantiating a time zone from data stored in the registry.","pos":[1102,1182]},{"content":"In addition, <ph id=\"ph1\">`static`</ph> (<ph id=\"ph2\">`shared`</ph> in Visual Basic) properties of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.TimeZoneInfo&gt;</ph> class provide access to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the local time zone.","pos":[1183,1358],"source":" In addition, `static` (`shared` in Visual Basic) properties of the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo> class provide access to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and the local time zone."},{"pos":[1362,2404],"content":"[!NOTE]\nFor time zones that are not defined in the registry, you can create custom time zones by calling the overloads of the <xref:System.TimeZoneInfo.CreateCustomTimeZone%2A> method.
