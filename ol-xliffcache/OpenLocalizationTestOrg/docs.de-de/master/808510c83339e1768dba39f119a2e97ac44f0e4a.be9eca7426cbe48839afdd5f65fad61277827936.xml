\n|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Conversion>|Contains members that convert decimal numbers to other bases, numbers to strings, strings to numbers, and one data type to another.|  \n|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.DateAndTime>|Contains members that get the current date or time, perform date calculations, return a date or time, set the date or time, or time the duration of a process.|  \n|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ErrObject>|Contains information about run-time errors and methods to raise or clear an error.|  \n|<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem>|Contains members
