You can query for information, and insert, update, and delete information from tables.  \n  \n## Selecting  \n Selecting (*projection*) is achieved by just writing a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] query in your own programming language, and then executing that query to retrieve the results. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] itself translates all the necessary operations into the necessary SQL operations that you are familiar with. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/index.md).  \n  \n In the following example, the company names of customers from London are retrieved and displayed in the console window.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqGettingStarted#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/cs/Program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqGettingStarted#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/vb/Module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Inserting  \n To execute a SQL `Insert`, just add objects to the object model you have created, and call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> on the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>.  \n  \n In the following example, a new customer and information about the customer is added to the `Customers` table by using <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601.InsertOnSubmit%2A>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqGettingStarted#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/cs/Program.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqGettingStarted#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqGettingStarted/vb/Module1.vb#2)]  \n  \n## Updating  \n To `Update` a database entry, first retrieve the item and edit it directly in the object model. After you have modified the object, call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> on the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> to update the database.  \n  \n In the following example, all customers who are from London are retrieved.
