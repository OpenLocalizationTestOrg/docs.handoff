Instead, the sample calls the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices.Load%2A> method. The sample is a [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] client application that loads XAML workflows using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class and executes them. After they have been loaded using the <xref:System.Activities.XamlIntegration.ActivityXamlServices> class, a <xref:System.Activities.DynamicActivity%601> is returned that can be executed.  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the LoadFromXAML.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
