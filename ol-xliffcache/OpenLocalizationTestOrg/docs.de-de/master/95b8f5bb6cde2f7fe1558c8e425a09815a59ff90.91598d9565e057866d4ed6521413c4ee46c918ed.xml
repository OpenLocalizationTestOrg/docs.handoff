In addition, you can use the `transactionFlow` element and its `transactionProtocol` attribute to build your own custom binding. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] setting the configuration elements, see [\\<binding>](../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md) and [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  \n  \n The `transactionFlow` attribute specifies whether transaction flow is enabled for service endpoints that use the binding.  \n  \n## Configuring transactionProtocol  \n The `transactionProtocol` attribute specifies the transaction protocol to use with service endpoints that use the binding.  \n  \n The following is an example of a configuration section that configures the specified binding to support transaction flow, as well as a use the WS-AtomicTransaction protocol.  \n  \n```  \n<netNamedPipeBinding>  \n   <binding name=\"test\"  \n      closeTimeout=\"00:00:10\"  \n      openTimeout=\"00:00:20\"   \n      receiveTimeout=\"00:00:30\"  \n      sendTimeout=\"00:00:40\"  \n      transactionFlow=\"true\"  \n      transactionProtocol=\"WSAtomicTransactionOctober2004\"  \n      hostNameComparisonMode=\"WeakWildcard\"  \n      maxBufferSize=\"1001\"  \n      maxConnections=\"123\"   \n      maxReceivedMessageSize=\"1000\">  \n   </binding>  \n</netNamedPipeBinding>  \n```  \n  \n## Configuring transactionTimeout  \n You can configure the `transactionTimeout` attribute for your [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service in the `behavior` element of the configuration file. The following code demonstrates how to do this.  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n   <system.serviceModel>  \n      <behaviors>  \n         <behavior name=\"NewBehavior\" transactionTimeout=\"00:01:00\" /> <!-- 1 minute timeout -->  \n      </behaviors>  \n   </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n The `transactionTimeout` attribute specifies the time period within which a new transaction created at the service must complete. It is used as the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> time-out for any operation that establishes a new transaction, and if <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> is applied, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A> property is set to `true`.  \n  \n The time-out specifies the duration of time from the creation of the transaction to the completion of phase 1 in the two-phase commit protocol.  \n  \n If this attribute is set within a `service` configuration section, you should apply at least one method of the corresponding service with <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute>, in which the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A> property is set to `true`.  \n  \n Note that the time-out value used is the smaller value between this `transactionTimeout` configuration setting and any <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute.TransactionTimeout%2A> property.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<binding>](../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md)   \n [WCF Configuration
