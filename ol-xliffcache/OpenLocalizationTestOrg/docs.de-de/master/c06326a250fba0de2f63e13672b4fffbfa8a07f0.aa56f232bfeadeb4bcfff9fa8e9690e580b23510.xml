By default, `-warnaserror-` is in effect; warnings do not prevent the compiler from producing an output file. The `-warnaserror` option, which is the same as `-warnaserror+`, causes warnings to be treated as errors.|  \n|`numberList`|Optional. Comma-delimited list of the warning ID numbers to which the `-warnaserror` option applies. If no warning ID is specified, the `-warnaserror` option applies to all warnings.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `-warnaserror` option treats all warnings as errors. Any messages that would ordinarily be reported as warnings are instead reported as errors. The compiler reports subsequent occurrences of the same warning as warnings.  \n  \n By default, `-warnaserror-` is in effect, which causes the warnings to be informational only. The `-warnaserror` option, which is the same as `-warnaserror+`, causes warnings to be treated as errors.  \n  \n If you want only a few specific warnings to be treated as errors, you may specify a comma-separated list of warning numbers to treat as errors.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-warnaserror` option does not control how warnings are displayed. Use the [-nowarn](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/nowarn.md) option to disable warnings.  \n  \n|To set -warnaserror to treat all warnings as errors in the Visual Studio IDE|  \n|---|  \n|1.  Have a project selected in **Solution Explorer**. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. <br />2.  Click the **Compile** tab.<br />3.  Make sure the **Disable all warnings** check box is unchecked.<br />4.
