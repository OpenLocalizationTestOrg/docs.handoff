The `TextFieldType` property defines whether it is a delimited file or one with fixed-width fields of text.  \n  \n### To parse a comma delimited text file  \n  \n1.  Create a new `TextFieldParser`. The following code creates the `TextFieldParser` named `MyReader` and opens the file `test.txt`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIORead#15](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files_1.vb)]  \n  \n2.  Define the `TextField` type and delimiter. The following code defines the `TextFieldType` property as `Delimited` and the delimiter as \",\".  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIORead#16](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files_2.vb)]  \n  \n3.  Loop through the fields in the file. If any lines are corrupt, report an error and continue parsing. The following code loops through the file, displaying each field in turn and reporting any fields that are formatted incorrectly.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIORead#17](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files_3.vb)]  \n  \n4.  Close the `While` and `Using` blocks with `End While` and `End Using`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIORead#18](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files_4.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example reads from the file `test.txt`.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbFileIORead#19](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files_5.vb)]  \n  \n## Robust programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   A row cannot be parsed using the specified format (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.MalformedLineException>). The exception message specifies the line causing the exception, while the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.TextFieldParser.ErrorLine%2A> property is assigned the text contained in the line.  \n  \n-   The specified file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   A partial-trust situation in which the user does not have sufficient permissions to access the file.
