This is an overloaded method which, in its simplest form, accepts a single parameter, a **DataReader**. In this form, it simply loads the **DataTable** with rows. Optionally, you can specify the **LoadOption** parameter to control how data is added to the **DataTable**.  \n  \n The **LoadOption** parameter is particularly useful in cases where the **DataTable** already contains rows of data, because it describes how incoming data from the data source will be combined with the data already in the table. For example, **PreserveCurrentValues** (the default) specifies that in cases where a row is marked as **Added** in the **DataTable**, the **Original** value or each column is set to the contents of the matching row from the data source. The **Current** value will retain the values assigned when the row was added, and the **RowState** of the row will be set to **Changed**.  \n  \n The following table gives a short description of the <xref:System.Data.LoadOption> enumeration values.  \n  \n|LoadOption value|Description|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|  \n|**OverwriteRow**|If incoming rows have the same **PrimaryKey** value as a row already in the **DataTable**, the **Original** and **Current** values of each column are replaced with the values in the incoming row, and the **RowState** property is set to **Unchanged**.<br /><br /> Rows from the data source that do not already exist in the **DataTable** are added with a **RowState** value of **Unchanged**.<br /><br /> This option in effect refreshes the contents of the **DataTable** so that it matches the contents of the data source.|  \n|**PreserveCurrentValues (default)**|If incoming rows have the same **PrimaryKey** value as a row already in the **DataTable**, the **Original** value is set to the contents of the incoming row, and the **Current** value is not changed.<br /><br /> If the **RowState** is **Added** or **Modified**, it is set to **Modified**.<br /><br /> If the **RowState** was **Deleted**, it remains **Deleted**.<br /><br /> Rows from the data source that do not already exist in the **DataTable** are added, and the **RowState** is set to **Unchanged**.|  \n|**UpdateCurrentValues**|If incoming rows have the same **PrimaryKey** value as the row already in the **DataTable**, the **Current** value is copied to the **Original** value, and the **Current** value is then set to the contents of the incoming row.<br /><br /> If the **RowState** in the **DataTable** was **Added**, the **RowState** remains **Added**. For rows marked as **Modified** or **Deleted**, the **RowState** is **Modified**.<br /><br /> Rows from the data source that do not already exist in the **DataTable** are added, and the **RowState** is set to **Added**.|  \n  \n The following sample uses the **Load** method to display a list of birthdays for the employees in the **Northwind** database.  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate Sub LoadBirthdays(ByVal connectionString As String)  \n    ' Assumes that connectionString is a valid connection string  \n    ' to the Northwind database on SQL Server.  \n    Dim queryString As String = _  \n    \"SELECT LastName, FirstName, BirthDate \" & _  \n      \" FROM dbo.Employees \" & _  \n      \"ORDER BY BirthDate, LastName, FirstName\"  \n  \n    ' Open and fill a DataSet.   \n    Dim adapter As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter( _  \n        queryString, connectionString)  \n    Dim employees As New DataSet  \n    adapter.Fill(employees, \"Employees\")  \n  \n    ' Create a SqlDataReader for use with the Load Method.  \n    Dim reader As DataTableReader = employees.GetDataReader()  \n  \n    ' Create an instance of DataTable and assign the first  \n    ' DataTable in the DataSet.Tables collection to it.  \n    Dim dataTableEmp As DataTable = employees.Tables(0)  \n  \n    ' Fill the DataTable with data by calling Load and  \n    ' passing the SqlDataReader.  \n    dataTableEmp.Load(reader, LoadOption.OverwriteRow)  \n  \n    ' Loop through the rows collection and display the values  \n    ' in the console window.  \n    Dim employeeRow As DataRow  \n    For Each employeeRow In dataTableEmp.Rows  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"{0:MM\\\\dd\\\\yyyy}\" & ControlChars.Tab & _  \n          \"{1}, {2}\", _  \n          employeeRow(\"BirthDate\"), _  \n          employeeRow(\"LastName\"), _  \n          employeeRow(\"FirstName\"))  \n    Next employeeRow  \n  \n    ' Keep the window opened to view the contents.  \n    Console.ReadLine()  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n
