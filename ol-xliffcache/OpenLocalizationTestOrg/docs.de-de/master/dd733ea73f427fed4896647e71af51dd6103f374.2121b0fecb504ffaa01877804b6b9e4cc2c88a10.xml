However, you may want the flexibility to develop services that internally use transactional components hosted within Enterprise Services. Because the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Transactions feature is built on the <xref:System.Transactions> infrastructure, the process for integrating Enterprise Services with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is identical to that for specifying interoperability between <xref:System.Transactions> and Enterprise Services, as outlined in [Interoperability with Enterprise Services and COM+ Transactions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94949).  \n  \n To provide the desired level of interoperability between the incoming flowed transaction and the COM+ context transaction, the service implementation must create a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance and use the appropriate value from the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> enumeration.  \n  \n## Integrating Enterprise Services with a Service Operation  \n The following code demonstrates an operation, with Allowed transaction flow, that creates a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> with the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> option. The following conditions apply in this scenario:  \n  \n-   If the client flows a transaction, the operation, including the call to the Enterprise Services component, is executed within the scope of that transaction. Using <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> ensures that the transaction is synchronized with the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> context, which means that the ambient transaction for <xref:System.Transactions> and the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> is the same.  \n  \n-   If the client does not flow a transaction, setting <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute.TransactionScopeRequired%2A> to `true` creates a new transaction scope for the operation. Similarly, using <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> ensures that the operation’s transaction is the same as the transaction used inside the <xref:System.EnterpriseServices> component's context.  \n  \n Any additional method calls also occur within the scope of the same operation’s transaction.  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract()]  \npublic interface ICustomerServiceContract  \n{  \n   [OperationContract]  \n   [TransactionFlow(TransactionFlowOption.Allowed)]  \n   void UpdateCustomerNameOperation(int customerID, string newCustomerName);  \n}  \n  \n[ServiceBehavior(TransactionIsolationLevel = System.Transactions.IsolationLevel.Serializable)]  \npublic class CustomerService : ICustomerServiceContract  \n{  \n   [OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true, TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  \n   public void UpdateCustomerNameOperation(int customerID, string newCustomerName)  \n   {  \n   // Create a transaction scope with full ES interop  \n      using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope(  \n                     TransactionScopeOption.Required,  \n                     new TransactionOptions(),  \n                     EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full))  \n      {  \n         // Create an Enterprise Services component  \n         // Call UpdateCustomer method on an Enterprise Services   \n         // component   \n  \n         // Call UpdateOtherCustomerData method on an Enterprise   \n         // Services component   \n         ts.Complete();  \n      }  \n  \n      // Do UpdateAdditionalData on an non-Enterprise Services  \n      // component  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n If no synchronization is required between an operation’s current transaction and calls to transactional Enterprise Services components, then use the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> option when instantiating the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance.  \n  \n## Integrating Enterprise Services with a Client  \n The following code demonstrates client code using a <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> instance with the <xref:System.Transactions.EnterpriseServicesInteropOption> setting. In this scenario, calls to service operations that support transaction flow occur within the scope of the same transaction as the calls to Enterprise Services components.  \n  \n```  \nstatic void Main()  \n{  \n    // Create a client  \n    CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  \n  \n    // Create a transaction scope with full ES interop  \n    using (TransactionScope ts = new TransactionScope(  \n          TransactionScopeOption.Required,  \n          new TransactionOptions(),  \n          EnterpriseServicesInteropOption.Full))  \n    {  \n        // Call Add calculator service operation  \n  \n        // Create an Enterprise Services component  \n  \n        // Call UpdateCustomer method on an Enterprise Services   \n        // component   \n  \n        ts.Complete();  \n    }  \n  \n    // Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and   \n    // cleans up resources  \n    client.Close();  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Integrating with
