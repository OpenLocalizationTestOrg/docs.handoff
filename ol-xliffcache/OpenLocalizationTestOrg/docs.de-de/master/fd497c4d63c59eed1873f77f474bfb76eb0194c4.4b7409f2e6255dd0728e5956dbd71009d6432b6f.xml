You might want to filter based on preceding or following sibling elements. You might want to filter based on child or ancestor elements.  \n  \n You can do this by writing a query and using the results of the query in the `where` clause. If you have to first test against null, and then test the value, it is more convenient to do the query in a `let` clause, and then use the results in the `where` clause.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example selects all `p` elements that are immediately followed by a `ul` element.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim doc As XElement = _  \n    <Root>  \n        <p id='1'/>  \n        <ul>abc</ul>  \n        <Child>  \n            <p id='2'/>  \n            <notul/>  \n            <p id='3'/>  \n            <ul>def</ul>  \n            <p id='4'/>  \n        </Child>  \n        <Child>  \n            <p id='5'/>  \n            <notul/>  \n            <p id='6'/>  \n            <ul>abc</ul>  \n            <p id='7'/>  \n        </Child>  \n    </Root>  \n  \nDim items As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = _  \n    From e In doc...<p> _  \n    Let z = e.ElementsAfterSelf().FirstOrDefault() _  \n    Where z IsNot Nothing AndAlso z.Name.LocalName = \"ul\" _  \n    Select e  \n  \nFor Each e As XElement In items  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"id = {0}\", e.@<id>)  \nNext  \n  \n```  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nid = 1  \nid = 3  \nid = 6  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows the same query for XML that is in a namespace.
