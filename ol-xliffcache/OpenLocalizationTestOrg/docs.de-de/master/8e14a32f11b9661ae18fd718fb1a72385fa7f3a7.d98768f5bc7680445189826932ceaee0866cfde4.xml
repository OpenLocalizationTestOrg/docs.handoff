For more information about its use in extension methods, see [Extension Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md).  \n  \n The following are common uses of `this`:  \n  \n-   To qualify members hidden by similar names, for example:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsAccess#4](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/this_1.cs)]  \n  \n-   To pass an object as a parameter to other methods, for example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    CalcTax(this);  \n    ```  \n  \n-   To declare indexers, for example:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsAccess#5](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/this_2.cs)]  \n  \n Static member functions, because they exist at the class level and not as part of an object, do not have a `this` pointer. It is an error to refer to `this` in a static method.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, `this` is used to qualify the `Employee` class members, `name` and `alias`, which are hidden by similar names. It is also used to pass an object to the method `CalcTax`, which belongs to another class.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsAccess#3](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/this_3.cs)]  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Keywords](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md)   \n [base](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/base.md)   \n [Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,48],"content":"this (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"this (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[63,90],"content":"this keyword (C# Reference)","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"this keyword (C# Reference)","pos":[0,27]}]},{"pos":[101,196],"content":"this (C#), this keyword (C#), this keyword (C# reference), this keyword (C# language reference)","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"this (C#), this keyword (C#), this keyword (C# reference), this keyword (C# language reference)","pos":[0,95]}]},{"pos":[728,747],"content":"this (C# Reference)","linkify":"this (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"this (C# Reference)","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[748,888],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`this`</ph> keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.","source":"The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method."},{"pos":[896,1127],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This article discusses the use of `this` with class instances.
