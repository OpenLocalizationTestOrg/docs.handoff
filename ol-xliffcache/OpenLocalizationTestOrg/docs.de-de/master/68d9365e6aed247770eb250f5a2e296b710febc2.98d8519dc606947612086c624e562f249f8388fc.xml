You can use any of these tools and frameworks: \n\n* [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps)\n* [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](../../docs/framework/wpf/index.md)\n* [Windows Forms](../../docs/framework/winforms/index.md)\n\nThis section contains topics that describe how to create Windows-based applications by using Windows Presentation Foundation or by using Windows Forms. However, you can also create web applications using the .NET Framework, and client applications for computers or devices that you make available through the Microsoft Store.\n \n## In this section\n\n[Windows Presentation Foundation](../../docs/framework/wpf/index.md)  \nProvides information about developing applications by using WPF.\n\n[Windows Forms](../../docs/framework/winforms/index.md)  \nProvides information about developing applications by using Windows Forms.\n\n[Common Client Technologies](../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/index.md)  \nProvides information about additional technologies that can be used when developing client applications.\n\n## Related

Store.\n\n[.NET for UWP apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185501.aspx)  \nDescribes the .NET Framework support for Store apps, which can be deployed to Windows computers and

with Windows Phone Silverlight.\n  \n[Developing for Multiple Platforms](../../docs/standard/cross-platform/index.md)  \nDescribes the different methods you can use the .NET Framework to target multiple client app types.\n\n[Get Started with ASP.NET Web Sites](https://www.asp.net/get-started/websites)  \nDescribes the ways you can develop web apps using ASP.NET.\n\n## See also\n\n- [.NET
