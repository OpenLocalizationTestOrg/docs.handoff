It then reads the remaining characters in the string, stores them in the array starting at the sixth element, and displays the contents of the array.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[Conceptual.StringReader#1](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.stringreader/cpp/source.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.StringReader#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.stringreader/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.StringReader#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.stringreader/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The next example reads all the characters asynchronously from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control, and stores them in an array.
