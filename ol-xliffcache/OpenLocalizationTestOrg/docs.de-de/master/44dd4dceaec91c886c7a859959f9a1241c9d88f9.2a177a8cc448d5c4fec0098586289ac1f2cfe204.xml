This distinction is important because of the methods used to navigate sibling, parent, and child nodes of the XML Document Object Model (DOM). For example, the **PreviousSibling** and **NextSibling** methods are not used to navigate from an element to an attribute or between attributes. Instead, an attribute is a property of an element and is owned by an element, has an **OwnerElement** property and not a **parentNode** property, and has distinct methods of navigation.  \n  \n When the current node is an element, use the **HasAttribute** method to see if there are any attributes associated with the element. Once it is known that an element has attributes, there are multiple methods for accessing attributes. To retrieve a single attribute from the element, you can use the **GetAttribute** and **GetAttributeNode** methods of the **XmlElement** or you can obtain all the attributes into a collection. Obtaining the collection is useful if you need to iterate over the collection. If you want all attributes from the element, use the **Attributes** property of the element to retrieve all the attributes into a collection.  \n  \n## Retrieving All Attributes into a Collection  \n If you want all the attributes of an element node put into a collection, call the **XmlElement.Attributes** property. This gets the **XmlAttributeCollection** that contains all the attributes of an element. The **XmlAttributeCollection** class inherits from the **XmlNamedNode** map. Therefore, the methods and properties available on the collection include those available on a named node map in addition to methods and properties specific to the **XmlAttributeCollection** class, such as the **ItemOf** property or the **Append** method. Each item in the attribute collection represents an **XmlAttribute** node. To find the number of attributes on an element, get the **XmlAttributeCollection**, and use the **Count** property to see how many **XmlAttribute** nodes are in the collection.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to retrieve an attribute collection and, using the **Count** method for the looping index, iterate over it. The code then shows how to retrieve a single attribute from the collection and display its value.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \n  \nPublic Class Sample  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n  \n        Dim doc As XmlDocument = New XmlDocument()  \n        doc.LoadXml(\"<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861001-57-5' misc='sale item'>\" & _  \n               \"<title>The Handmaid's Tale</title>\" & _  \n               \"<price>14.95</price>\" & _  \n               \"</book>\")  \n  \n        ' Move to an element.   \n        Dim myElement As XmlElement = doc.DocumentElement  \n  \n        ' Create an attribute collection from the element.  \n        Dim attrColl As XmlAttributeCollection = myElement.Attributes  \n  \n        ' Show the collection by iterating over it.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Display all the attributes in the collection...\")  \n        Dim i As Integer  \n        For i = 0 To attrColl.Count - 1  \n            Console.Write(\"{0} = \", attrColl.ItemOf(i).Name)  \n            Console.Write(\"{0}\", attrColl.ItemOf(i).Value)  \n            Console.WriteLine()  \n        Next  \n  \n        ' Retrieve a single attribute from the collection; specifically, the  \n        ' attribute with the name \"misc\".  \n        Dim attr As XmlAttribute = attrColl(\"misc\")  \n  \n        ' Retrieve the value from that attribute.  \n        Dim miscValue As String = attr.InnerXml  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Display the attribute information.\")  \n        Console.WriteLine(miscValue)  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.IO;  \nusing System.Xml;  \n  \npublic class Sample  \n{  \n  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n        XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();  \n        doc.LoadXml(\"<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861001-57-5' misc='sale item'>\" +  \n                      \"<title>The Handmaid's Tale</title>\" +  \n                      \"<price>14.95</price>\" +  \n                      \"</book>\");  \n  \n        // Move to an element.  \n        XmlElement myElement = doc.DocumentElement;  \n  \n        // Create an attribute collection from the element.  \n        XmlAttributeCollection attrColl = myElement.Attributes;  \n  \n        // Show the collection by iterating over it.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Display all the attributes in the collection...\");  \n        for (int i = 0; i < attrColl.Count; i++)  \n        {  \n            Console.Write(\"{0} = \", attrColl[i].Name);  \n            Console.Write(\"{0}\", attrColl[i].Value);  \n            Console.WriteLine();  \n        }  \n  \n        // Retrieve a single attribute from the collection; specifically, the  \n        // attribute with the name \"misc\".  \n        XmlAttribute attr = attrColl[\"misc\"];  \n  \n        // Retrieve the value from that attribute.  \n        String miscValue = attr.InnerXml;  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Display the attribute information.\");  \n        Console.WriteLine(miscValue);  \n  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This example displays the following output:  \n  \n **Output**  \n  \n Display all the attributes in the collection.  \n  \n```  \ngenre = novel  \nISBN = 1-861001-57-5  \nmisc = sale item  \nDisplay the attribute information.  \nsale item  \n```  \n  \n The information in an attribute collection can be retrieved by name or index number. The example above shows how to retrieve data by name. The next example shows how to retrieve data by index number.  \n  \n Because the **XmlAttributeCollection** is a collection and can be iterated over by name or index, this example shows selecting the first attribute out of the collection using a zero-based index and using the following file, **baseuri.xml**, as input.  \n  \n### Input  \n  \n```  \n<!-- XML fragment -->  \n<book genre=\"novel\">  \n  <title>Pride And Prejudice</title>  \n</book>  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nOption Explicit On  \nOption Strict On  \n  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \n  \nPublic Class Sample  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n        ' Create the XmlDocument.  \n        Dim doc As New XmlDocument()  \n        doc.Load(\"http://localhost/baseuri.xml\")  \n  \n        ' Display information on the attribute node.

It returns an object of type **XmlAttribute**. Once you have an **XmlAttribute**, all the methods and properties available in the <xref:System.Xml.XmlAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> class are available on that object, such as finding the **OwnerElement**.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \n  \nPublic Class Sample  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n  \n        Dim doc As XmlDocument = New XmlDocument()  \n        doc.LoadXml(\"<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861001-57-5' misc='sale item'>\" & _  \n               \"<title>The Handmaid's Tale</title>\" & _  \n               \"<price>14.95</price>\" & _  \n               \"</book>\")  \n  \n        ' Move to an element.  \n        Dim root As XmlElement  \n        root = doc.DocumentElement  \n  \n        ' Get an attribute.  \n        Dim attr As XmlAttribute  \n        attr = root.GetAttributeNode(\"ISBN\")  \n  \n        ' Display the value of the attribute.  \n        Dim attrValue As String  \n        attrValue = attr.InnerXml  \n        Console.WriteLine(attrValue)  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.IO;  \nusing System.Xml;  \n  \n public class Sample  \n {  \n      public static void Main()  \n      {  \n    XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();  \n     doc.LoadXml(\"<book genre='novel' ISBN='1-861003-78' misc='sale item'>\" +  \n                   \"<title>The Handmaid's Tale</title>\" +  \n                   \"<price>14.95</price>\" +  \n                   \"</book>\");   \n  \n    // Move to an element.  \n     XmlElement root = doc.DocumentElement;  \n  \n    // Get an attribute.  \n     XmlAttribute attr = root.GetAttributeNode(\"ISBN\");  \n  \n    // Display the value of the attribute.  \n     String attrValue = attr.InnerXml;  \n     Console.WriteLine(attrValue);  \n  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n You can also do as shown in the previous example, where a single attribute node is retrieved from the attribute collection. The following code example shows how one line of code can be written to retrieve a single attribute by index number from the root of the XML document tree, also known as the **DocumentElement** property.  \n  \n```  \nXmlAttribute attr = doc.DocumentElement.Attributes[0];  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [XML Document Object Model
