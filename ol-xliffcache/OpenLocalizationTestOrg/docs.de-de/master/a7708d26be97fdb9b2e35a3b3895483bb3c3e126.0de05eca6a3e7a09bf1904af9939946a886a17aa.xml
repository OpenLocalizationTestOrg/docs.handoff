Hosts typically provide assembly stores to allow assemblies to be loaded from formats other than the file system.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the host does not implement `IHostAssemblyStore`, `GetAssemblyStore` should return an HRESULT value of E_NOINTERFACE, and should set `ppAssemblyStore` to null.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
