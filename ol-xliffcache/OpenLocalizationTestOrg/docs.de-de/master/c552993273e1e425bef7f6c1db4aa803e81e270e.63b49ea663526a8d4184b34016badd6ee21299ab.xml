Anonymous type members must be declared with a member assignment, simple name or member access.  \n  \n An anonymous type must be declared with a member assignment, simple name, or member access.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that your declaration uses only member assignment, simple names, or member access expressions.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code generates CS0746 in the declaration of `incorrect_1` and `incorrect_2`. The following declarations show two of the correct ways to declare an anonymous type.  \n  \n```  \n// cs0746.cs  \npublic class C  \n{  \n    public static int Main()  \n    {  \n        int i = 100;  \n        string s = \"Bottles of beer.\";  \n  \n        var incorrect_1 = new { a.b = 1 }; // CS0746   \n        var incorrect_2 = new {100, \"Bottles of beer.\"}; // CS0746  \n        var correct_1 = new { i, s }; //OK  \n        var correct_2 = new {num = i, message = s}; // OK  \n  \n        return 1;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Anonymous Types](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/anonymous-types.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0746 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0746 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS0746","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0746","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0746","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Invalid anonymous type member declarator.","pos":[587,628]},{"content":"Anonymous type members must be declared with a member assignment, simple name or member access.","pos":[629,724]},{"content":"An anonymous type must be declared with a member assignment, simple name, or member access.","pos":[731,822]},{"pos":[831,852],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that your declaration uses only member assignment, simple names, or member access expressions.","pos":[862,963]},{"pos":[972,979],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code generates CS0746 in the declaration of <ph id=\"ph1\">`incorrect_1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`incorrect_2`</ph>.","pos":[983,1073],"source":"The following code generates CS0746 in the declaration of `incorrect_1` and `incorrect_2`."},{"content":"The following declarations show two of the correct ways to declare an anonymous type.","pos":[1074,1159]},{"pos":[1593,1601],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1605,1693],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Anonymous Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/anonymous-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Anonymous Types](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/anonymous-types.md)"}]}
