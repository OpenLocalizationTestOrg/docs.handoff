Except for the differences shown in the following table, all the rules that are defined for property accessors apply to indexer accessors also.  \n  \n|Property|Indexer|  \n|--------------|-------------|  \n|Allows methods to be called as if they were public data members.|Allows elements of an internal collection of an object to be accessed by using array notation on the object itself.|  \n|Accessed through a simple name.|Accessed through an index.|  \n|Can be a static or an instance member.|Must be an instance member.|  \n|A [get](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/get.md) accessor of a property has no parameters.|A `get` accessor of an indexer has the same formal parameter list as the indexer.|  \n|A [set](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/set.md) accessor of a property contains the implicit `value` parameter.|A `set` accessor of an indexer has the same formal parameter list as the indexer, and also to the [value](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/value.md) parameter.|  \n|Supports shortened syntax with [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md).|Does not support shortened syntax.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming
