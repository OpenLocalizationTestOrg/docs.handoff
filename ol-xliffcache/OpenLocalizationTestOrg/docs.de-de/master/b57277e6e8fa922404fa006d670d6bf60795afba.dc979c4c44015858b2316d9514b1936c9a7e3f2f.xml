With the splitter control, the user can resize the docked control that is immediately before it. Therefore, to enable the user to resize a docked control at run time, dock the control to be resized to an edge of a container, and then dock a splitter control to the same side of that container.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>   \n [How to: Dock Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-dock-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,515],"nodes":[{"content":"Splitter Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"Splitter Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Splitter Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]}],"pos":[6,67],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Splitter Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
