The following articles provide overview of those classes:\n\n|Title|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[The managed thread pool](the-managed-thread-pool.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which provides a pool of worker threads that are managed by .NET.|  \n|[Timers](timers.md)|Describes .NET timers that can be used in a multithreaded environment.|\n|[Overview of synchronization primitives](overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md)|Describes types that can be used to synchronize access to a shared resource or control thread interaction.|\n|[EventWaitHandle](eventwaithandle.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.EventWaitHandle?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which represents a thread synchronization event.|\n|[CountdownEvent](countdownevent.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which represents a thread synchronization event that becomes set when its count is zero.|\n|[Mutexes](mutexes.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Mutex?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which grants exclusive access to a shared resource.|\n|[Semaphore and SemaphoreSlim](semaphore-and-semaphoreslim.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Semaphore?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which limits number of threads that can access a shared resource or a pool of resources concurrently.|\n|[Barrier](barrier.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.Barrier?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, which implements the barrier pattern for coordination of threads in phased operations.|\n|[SpinLock](spinlock.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure, which is a lightweight alternative to the <xref:System.Threading.Monitor?displayProperty=nameWithType> class for certain low-level locking scenarios.|\n|[SpinWait](spinwait.md)|Describes the <xref:System.Threading.SpinWait?displayProperty=nameWithType> structure, which provides support for spin-based waiting.|\n\n## See also\n\n-
