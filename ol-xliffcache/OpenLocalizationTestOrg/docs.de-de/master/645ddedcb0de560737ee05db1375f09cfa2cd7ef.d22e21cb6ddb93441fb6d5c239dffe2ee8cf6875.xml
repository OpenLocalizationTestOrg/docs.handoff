For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control typically displays a caption that indicates what action will be performed when the button is clicked. For all controls, you can set or return the text by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property. You can change the font by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property.  \n  \n### To set the text and font with the designer  \n  \n1.  In the Properties window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the control to an appropriate string.  \n  \n     To create an underlined shortcut key, includes an ampersand (&) before the letter that will be the shortcut key.  \n  \n2.  In the Properties window, click the ellipsis button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Font%2A> property.  \n  \n     In the standard font dialog box, select the font, font style, size, effects (such as strikeout or underline), and script that you want.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)\n- [Using Fonts and Text](../advanced/using-fonts-and-text.md)\n- [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,278],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
