When this happens, the system checks that the source you specified is registered with the event log to which the component is writing, and calls <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> if needed.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Remove the association of the source with the first log using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> method.  \n  \n2.  Register the source with the new log.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [My.Application.Log](xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase.Log)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,146],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Another event log has already registered a source with this name\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: e6f5cd95-bb3f-4845-84fb-ae623a9bd44e","nodes":[{"content":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","nodes":[{"content":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[153,217],"content":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","linkify":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","nodes":[{"content":"Another event log has already registered a source with this name","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"An attempt was made to write an entry to an event log where the specified source is registered with another event log.","pos":[218,336]},{"content":"You must set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A&gt;</ph> property of your <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog&gt;</ph> component instance before your component writes an entry to a log.","pos":[343,523],"source":"You must set the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property of your <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog> component instance before your component writes an entry to a log."},{"content":"When this happens, the system checks that the source you specified is registered with the event log to which the component is writing, and calls <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A&gt;</ph> if needed.","pos":[524,735],"source":" When this happens, the system checks that the source you specified is registered with the event log to which the component is writing, and calls <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> if needed."},{"pos":[744,765],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[775,967],"content":"Remove the association of the source with the first log using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A&gt;</ph> or the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A&gt;</ph> method.","source":"Remove the association of the source with the first log using the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> or the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.DeleteEventSource%2A> method."},{"content":"Register the source with the new log.","pos":[977,1014]},{"pos":[1023,1031],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1035,1123],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>My.Application.Log<ept id=\"p1\">](xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase.Log)</ept>","source":"[My.Application.Log](xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase.Log)"}]}
