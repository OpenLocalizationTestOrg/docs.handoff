The following procedure generates the error by using a [response file](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n### To generate this error  \n  \n1.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    /target:exe /out:cs|2032.exe cs2032.cs  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want.  \n  \n3.  Open the **Start** menu. Locate and select the [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](../../../framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md).\n  \n4.  Change the current directory to `C:\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\Documents`.  \n  \n5.  Run the following command from the command prompt: `csc @cs2032.rsp`  \n  \n6.  The CS2032 error message appears because the response file, CS2032.rsp, contains a pipe character.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS2032\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS2032\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS2032\"\nms.assetid: 534e2d2f-d209-43dd-abc9-e5ea5b01efc4","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","linkify":"Compiler Error CS2032","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Character 'character' is not allowed on the command-line or in response files","pos":[194,271]},{"pos":[278,420],"content":"Response files and the command line options for csc.exe cannot contain ASCII control characters in the range 0-31 or the pipe (<ph id=\"ph1\">`|`</ph>) character.","source":"Response files and the command line options for csc.exe cannot contain ASCII control characters in the range 0-31 or the pipe (`|`) character."},{"content":"Compiler error CS2032 is difficult to demonstrate from the command line because the command line processor and the integrated development environment (IDE) filter out characters that are not valid.","pos":[427,624]},{"content":"The following procedure generates the error by using a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>response file<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md)</ept>.","pos":[625,782],"source":" The following procedure generates the error by using a [response file](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md)."},{"pos":[792,814],"content":"To generate this error","linkify":"To generate this error","nodes":[{"content":"To generate this error","pos":[0,22]}]},{"pos":[824,953],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>My Documents<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:","source":"In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:"},{"pos":[1037,1148],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>My Documents<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want.","source":"In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want."},{"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[1158,1182],"source":"Open the **Start** menu."},{"content":"Locate and select the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md)</ept>.","pos":[1183,1311],"source":" Locate and select the [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](../../../framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md)."},{"pos":[1319,1388],"content":"Change the current directory to <ph id=\"ph1\">`C:\\Users\\\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\Documents`</ph>.","source":"Change the current directory to `C:\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\Documents`."},{"pos":[1398,1466],"content":"Run the following command from the command prompt: <ph id=\"ph1\">`csc @cs2032.rsp`</ph>","source":"Run the following command from the command prompt: `csc @cs2032.rsp`"},{"content":"The CS2032 error message appears because the response file, CS2032.rsp, contains a pipe character.","pos":[1476,1574]}]}
