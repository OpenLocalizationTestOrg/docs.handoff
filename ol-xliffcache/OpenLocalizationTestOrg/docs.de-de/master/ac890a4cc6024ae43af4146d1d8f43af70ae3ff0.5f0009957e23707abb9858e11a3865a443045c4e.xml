The `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method allows the application to play only one background sound at a time; when the application plays a new background sound, it stops playing the previous background sound. You can also play a sound and wait for it to complete.  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When `AudioPlayMode.WaitToComplete` is specified, `My.Computer.Audio.Play` waits until the sound completes before calling code continues. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#15](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#15)]  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#16](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#16)]  \n  \n## Playing Looping Sounds  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#12)]  \n  \n The preceding code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Forms Applications > Sound**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should eventually stop the sound.  \n  \n## Stopping the Playing of Sounds in the Background  \n Use the `My.Computer.Audio.Stop` method to stop the application's currently playing background or looping sound.  \n  \n In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should stop the sound at some point.  \n  \n The following example stops a sound that is playing in the background.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#18](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#18)]  \n  \n The preceding code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet.

For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n## Playing System Sounds  \n Use the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play the specified system sound.  \n  \n The `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method takes as a parameter one of the shared members from the <xref:System.Media.SystemSound> class. The system sound <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk%2A> generally denotes errors.  \n  \n The following example uses the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play a system sound.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#17](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#17)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.Play%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.PlaySystemSound%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.Stop%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.AudioPlayMode>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,341],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"system sounds, playing\"\n  - \"system sounds\"\n  - \"playing sounds, Visual Basic\"\n  - \"sound loops\"\n  - \"My.Computer.Audio object, tasks\"\n  - \"sounds, playing\"\n  - \"sounds, background\"\n  - \"playing sounds\"\nms.assetid: f0d9e4ab-57c7-47b6-86d3-99ff07078040","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[348,377],"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[378,445],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.Computer.Audio`</ph> object provides methods for playing sounds.","source":"The `My.Computer.Audio` object provides methods for playing sounds."},{"pos":[454,468],"content":"Playing Sounds","linkify":"Playing Sounds","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"Background playing lets the application execute other code while the sound plays.","pos":[472,553]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.Computer.Audio.Play`</ph> method allows the application to play only one background sound at a time;
