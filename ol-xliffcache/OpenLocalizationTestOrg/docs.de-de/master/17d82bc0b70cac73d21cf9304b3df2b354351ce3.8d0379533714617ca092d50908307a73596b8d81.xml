If you are writing entries to an event log, you must specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property registers your component with the event log as a valid source of entries. A single source can be associated with (and therefore write entries to) only one event log at a time.  \n  \n By default, if you try to write an entry without first having registered your component as a valid source, the system automatically registers the source with the event log, using the value of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property as the source string.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure the source is registered to the correct log. To do this, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method or one of its overloads to specify a string that uniquely identifies your component to the event log.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Administering Event Logs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/35f53238-bdd2-417b-acd8-2fd9f7397f18)   \n [Event Log References](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4af0661c-6c96-49f4-961d-b26ed9bc3e87)   \n [How to: Add Your Application as a Source of Event Log Entries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/948ff920-a739-4e66-a191-ee951512d42c)   \n [How to: Remove an Event Source](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bc66c900-4b8a-426a-b8e2-17031a20167e)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,563],"nodes":[{"content":"Source name specified in EventLogSource is registered to a log other than that specified in EventLogName | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,121],"content":"Source name specified in EventLogSource is registered to a log other than that specified in EventLogName | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Source name specified in EventLogSource is registered to a log other than that specified in EventLogName | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,121]}]}],"pos":[6,130],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Source name specified in EventLogSource is registered to a log other than that specified in EventLogName | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  -
