The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class. Any procedure that has matching parameters of compatible types and return types can be used to create an instance of this delegate type.  \n  \n **Error ID**: BC36563  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [AddressOf Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)\n- [Delegate Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)\n- [Overload Resolution](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,222],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc36563\"\n  - \"vbc36563\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36563\"\nms.assetid: 3ca8b873-e98d-419b-95f2-d75bd2a9eb6c","nodes":[{"content":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","nodes":[{"content":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[229,290],"content":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","linkify":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","nodes":[{"content":"Method does not have a signature compatible with the delegate","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"There is an incompatibility between the signatures of the method and the delegate you are trying to use.","pos":[291,395]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Delegate`</ph> statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class.","pos":[396,486],"source":" The `Delegate` statement defines the parameter types and return types of a delegate class."},{"content":"Any procedure that has matching parameters of compatible types and return types can be used to create an instance of this delegate type.","pos":[487,623]},{"pos":[630,651],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>: BC36563","source":"**Error ID**: BC36563"},{"pos":[660,668],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[672,766],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[AddressOf Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)"},{"pos":[769,864],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Delegate Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)"},{"pos":[867,981],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overload Resolution<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)</ept>","source":"[Overload Resolution](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)"},{"pos":[984,1102],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Generic Types in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)"}]}
