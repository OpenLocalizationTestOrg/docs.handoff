When implementing the <xref:System.Windows.Data.IValueConverter> interface, it is a good practice to decorate the implementation with a <xref:System.Windows.Data.ValueConversionAttribute> attribute to indicate to development tools the data types involved in the conversion, as in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DataBindingLab#18](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DataBindingLab/CSharp/DateConverter.cs#18)]\n [!code-vb[DataBindingLab#18](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DataBindingLab/VisualBasic/DateConverter.vb#18)]  \n  \n Once you have created a converter, you can add it as a resource in your [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file. In the following example, *src* maps to the namespace in which *DateConverter* is defined.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DataBindingLab#15](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DataBindingLab/CSharp/DataBindingLabApp.xaml#15)]  \n  \n Finally, you can use the converter in your binding using the following syntax. In the following example, the text content of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> is bound to *StartDate*, which is a property of an external data source.  \n  \n [!code-xml[DataBindingLab#17](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DataBindingLab/CSharp/DataBindingLabApp.xaml#17)]  \n  \n The style resources referenced in the above example are defined in a resource section not shown in this topic.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Implement Binding Validation](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-implement-binding-validation.md)   \n [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md)   \n [How-to Topics](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-how-to-topics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,491],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Convert Bound Data | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
