It passes data to the custom activity by binding [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] variables to the dependency properties exposed by the custom activity.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n  \n1.

This sample includes a [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)] custom activity that invokes a <!--zz <xref:System.Workflow.Activities.Policy> --> `System.Workflow.Activities.Policy` activity.  \n  \n## TravelRuleLibrary  \n Opening TravelRuleSet.cs in the designer shows a custom sequential activity that contains a Policy activity as follows  \n  \n ![Interop Activity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/media/interoprulespolicy.jpg \"InteropRulesPolicy\")  \n  \n Double-click the **DiscountPolicy** policy activity to examine the rules. The Rules editor appears to show the rules.  \n  \n ![Rule Set Editor](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/media/interoprulesruleseteditor.jpg \"InteropRulesRuleSetEditor\")  \n  \n Right-click the **DiscountPolicy** activity and select the **View Code** option to examine the code-beside C# code that goes with this activity. Observe the dependency property setting for `DiscountLevel`. This is equivalent to an <xref:System.Activities.Argument> in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n```  \npublic static DependencyProperty DiscountLevelProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(\"DiscountLevel\", typeof(int), typeof(TravelRuleSet));  \n  \n[DescriptionAttribute(\"DiscountLevel\")]  \n[CategoryAttribute(\"DiscountLevel Category\")]  \n[BrowsableAttribute(true)]  \n[DesignerSerializationVisibilityAttribute(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Visible)]  \npublic int DiscountLevel  \n{  \n   get  \n   {  \nreturn ((int)base.GetValue(TravelRuleSet.DiscountLevelProperty)));  \n   }  \n   set  \n   {  \nbase.SetValue(TravelRuleSet.DiscountLevelProperty, value);  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## InteropWith35RuleSet  \n This is a [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] sequential workflow project that uses the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Interop> activity to integrate with the custom rule set created in the TravelRuleLibrary project.
