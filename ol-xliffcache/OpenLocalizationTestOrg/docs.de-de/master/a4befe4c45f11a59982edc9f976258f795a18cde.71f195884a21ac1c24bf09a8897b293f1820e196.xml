By default, the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] implements an optimistic concurrency model.|  \n|direction|Refers to the asymmetrical nature of some associations. Direction is specified with `FromRole` and `ToRole` attributes of a `NavigationProperty` or `ReferentialConstraint` element in a schema.<br /><br /> For more information, see [NavigationProperty Element (CSDL)](/ef/ef6/modeling/designer/advanced/edmx/csdl-spec#navigationproperty-element-csdl) and [navigation property](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md).|  \n|eager loading|The process of loading a specific set of related objects along with the objects that were explicitly requested in the query.|  \n|.edmx file|An XML file that contains the conceptual model (in CSDL), the storage model (in SSDL), and the mappings between them (in MSL).

Frequently, POCO entities are existing domain objects that you use in an [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] application. These entities support persistence ignorance. For more information, see [Working with POCO Entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/dd456853(v=vs.100)).|  \n|proxy object|An object that derives from a POCO class and is generated by the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] to support change tracking and lazy loading.
