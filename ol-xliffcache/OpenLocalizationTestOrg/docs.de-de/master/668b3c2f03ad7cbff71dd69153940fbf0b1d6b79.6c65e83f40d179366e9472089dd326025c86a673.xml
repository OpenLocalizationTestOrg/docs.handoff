These properties affect how messages are formatted. By default, the message body is formatted with the style set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle>. These settings can be specified at either the service contract level or the operation contract level.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The <xref:System.ServiceModel.DataContractFormatAttribute.Style%2A> style property determines how the WSDL metadata for the service is formatted. Possible values are <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle>. RPC means that the WSDL representation of messages exchanged for an operation contains parameters as if it were a remote procedure call. The following is an example.  \n  \n```  \n<wsdl:message name=\"IUseAndStyleCalculator_Add_InputMessage\">  \n    <wsdl:part name=\"n1\" type=\"xsd:double\"/>  \n    <wsdl:part name=\"n2\" type=\"xsd:double\"/>  \n</wsdl:message>  \n```  \n  \n Setting the style to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle> means that the WSDL representation contains a single element that represents the document that is exchanged for an operation as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```  \n<wsdl:message name=\"IUseAndStyleCalculator_Add_InputMessage\">  \n    <wsdl:part name=\"parameters\" element=\"tns:Add\"/>  \n</wsdl:message>  \n```  \n  \n The <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> property determines the format of the message. Possible values are <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse>; the default value is <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse>. Literal means that the message is a literal instance of the schema in the WSDL as shown in the following Document/ Literal example.  \n  \n```  \n<Add xmlns=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\">  \n    <n1>100</n1>  \n    <n2>15.99</n2>  \n</Add>  \n```  \n  \n Encoded means that the schemas in the WSDL are abstract specifications that are encoded according to the rules found in SOAP 1.1 section 5. The following is an RPC/Encoded example.  \n  \n```  \n<q1:Add xmlns:q1=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\">  \n    <n1 xsi:type=\"xsd:double\" xmlns=\"\">100</n1>  \n    <n2 xsi:type=\"xsd:double\" xmlns=\"\">15.99</n2>  \n</q1:Add>  \n```  \n  \n The WS-I Basic Profile 1.0 prohibits the use of <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse> and you should only use it when required by legacy services. The `Encoded` message format is only available when using the XmlSerializer.  \n  \n To allow you to see the messages being sent and received, this sample is based on the [Tracing and Message Logging](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/tracing-and-message-logging.md). The service configuration and source code have been modified to enable and utilize tracing and message logging. In addition, the <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> has been configured without security, so the logged messages can be viewed in an unencrypted format. The resulting trace logs (System.ServiceModel.e2e and Message.log) should be viewed by using the [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md). The traces are configured to be created in the C:\\LOGS folder. Create the folder before running the sample. To view message contents in the Trace Viewer tool, select **Messages** in both the left and the right panes of the tool.  \n  \n The following code shows the service contract with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> property set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatUse> and the format of the message body changed from the default <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle> to <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationFormatStyle>.  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\"),  \nXmlSerializerFormat(Style = OperationFormatStyle.Rpc,   \n                                 Use = OperationFormatUse.Encoded)]  \npublic interface IUseAndStyleCalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Add(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Divide(double n1, double n2);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n To see the difference between the different <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Use%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.XmlSerializerFormatAttribute.Style%2A> settings, modify them in the service, regenerate the client, run the sample, and examine the c:\\logs\\message.logs file with the Service Trace Viewer tool. Also observe the impact on the metadata by viewing http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc?wsdl. The metadata for services is typically broken up into multiple pages. The main wsdl page contains the WSDL bindings, but view http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/service.svc?wsdl=wsdl0 to observe the message definitions.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  Create a C:\\LOGS directory for logging messages. Give the user Network Service write permissions for this directory.  \n  \n3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
