The cause of the error can be conversion between parameters or, when the method and delegate are functions, conversion in the return values.  \n  \n The following code illustrates failed conversions. The delegate is `FunDel`.  \n  \n```vb  \nDelegate Function FunDel(ByVal i As Integer, ByVal d As Double) As Integer  \n```  \n  \n The following functions each differ from `FunDel` in a way that will cause this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nFunction ExampleMethod1(ByVal m As Integer, ByVal aDate As Date) As Integer  \nEnd Function  \n  \nFunction ExampleMethod2(ByVal m As Integer, ByVal aDouble As Double) As Date  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n Each of the following assignment statements causes the error.  \n  \n```vb  \nSub Main()  \n    ' The second parameters of FunDel and ExampleMethod1, Double and Date,  \n    ' are not compatible.  \n    'Dim d1 As FunDel = AddressOf ExampleMethod1  \n  \n    ' The return types of FunDel and ExampleMethod2, Integer and Date,  \n    ' are not compatible.  \n    'Dim d2 As FunDel = AddressOf ExampleMethod2  \n  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31143  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Examine the corresponding parameters and, if they are present, return types to determine which pair is not compatible.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)   \n [NOT IN BUILD: Delegates and the AddressOf Operator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b2ed932-8598-4355-b2f7-5cedb23ee86f)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,146],"content":"Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &lt;&#39;delegatename&#39;&gt; | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Method &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>methodname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate <ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;lt;</ph>&amp;#39;delegatename&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph4\">&amp;gt;</ph> | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,134],"source":"Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &lt;&#39;delegatename&#39;&gt; | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[662,779],"content":"Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &lt;&#39;delegatename&#39;&gt;","linkify":"Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &lt;&#39;delegatename&#39;&gt;","nodes":[{"content":"Method &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>methodname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate <ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;lt;</ph>&amp;#39;delegatename&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph4\">&amp;gt;</ph>","pos":[0,117],"source":"Method &#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; does not have a signature compatible with delegate &lt;&#39;delegatename&#39;&gt;"}]},{"content":"This error occurs when a conversion is required between a method and a delegate that is not possible.","pos":[780,881]},{"content":"The cause of the error can be conversion between parameters or, when the method and delegate are functions, conversion in the return values.","pos":[882,1022]},{"content":"The following code illustrates failed conversions.","pos":[1029,1079]},{"content":"The delegate is <ph id=\"ph1\">`FunDel`</ph>.","pos":[1080,1105],"source":" The delegate is `FunDel`."},{"pos":[1206,1292],"content":"The following functions each differ from <ph id=\"ph1\">`FunDel`</ph> in a way that will cause this error.","source":"The following functions each differ from `FunDel` in a way that will cause this error."},{"content":"Each of the following assignment statements causes the error.","pos":[1506,1567]},{"pos":[1928,1949],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31143","source":"**Error ID:** BC31143"},{"pos":[1958,1979],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Examine the corresponding parameters and, if they are present, return types to determine which pair is not compatible.","pos":[1989,2107]},{"pos":[2116,2124],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Relaxed Delegate Conversion<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2128,2255],"source":"[Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Delegates and the AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b2ed932-8598-4355-b2f7-5cedb23ee86f)</ept>","pos":[2258,2381],"source":" [NOT IN BUILD: Delegates and the AddressOf Operator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b2ed932-8598-4355-b2f7-5cedb23ee86f)"}]}
