with identifiers and friendly names.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
