You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) in a configuration file. If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory. If the assembly has a strong name, the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) can specify any location on the computer or on a network.  \n  \n Similar rules apply to locating assemblies when working with unmanaged code or COM interop applications: if the assembly will be shared by multiple applications, it should be installed into the global assembly cache. Assemblies used with unmanaged code must be exported as a type library and registered. Assemblies used by COM interop must be registered in the catalog, although in some cases this registration occurs automatically.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)   \n [Configuring Apps](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md)   \n [Advanced COM Interoperability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3ada36e5-2390-4d70-b490-6ad8de92f2fb)   \n [Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,47],"content":"Assembly Placement | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Assembly Placement | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[512,530],"content":"Assembly Placement","linkify":"Assembly Placement","nodes":[{"content":"Assembly Placement","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"For most .NET Framework applications, you locate assemblies that make up an application in the application's directory, in a subdirectory of the application's directory, or in the global assembly cache (if the assembly is shared).","pos":[531,761]},{"content":"You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> in a configuration file.","pos":[762,974],"source":" You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) in a configuration file."},{"content":"If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory.","pos":[975,1216],"source":" If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory."},{"content":"If the assembly has a strong name, the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> can specify any location on the computer or on a network.","pos":[1217,1415],"source":" If the assembly has a strong name, the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) can specify any location on the computer or on a network."},{"content":"Similar rules apply to locating assemblies when working with unmanaged code or COM interop applications: if the assembly will be shared by multiple applications, it should be installed into the global assembly cache.","pos":[1422,1638]},{"content":"Assemblies used with unmanaged code must be exported as a type library and registered.","pos":[1639,1725]},{"content":"Assemblies used by COM interop must be registered in the catalog, although in some cases this registration occurs automatically.","pos":[1726,1854]},{"pos":[1863,1871],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How the Runtime Locates Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1875,1986],"source":"[How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Configuring Apps<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1989,2058],"source":" [Configuring Apps](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Advanced COM Interoperability<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3ada36e5-2390-4d70-b490-6ad8de92f2fb)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2061,2164],"source":" [Advanced COM Interoperability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3ada36e5-2390-4d70-b490-6ad8de92f2fb) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)</ept>","pos":[2167,2293],"source":" [Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)"}]}
