Use the [ICLRRuntimeInfo::LoadLibrary](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimeinfo-loadlibrary-method.md) method instead.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT LoadLibraryShim (  \n    [in]  LPCWSTR  szDllName,  \n    [in]  LPCWSTR  szVersion,  \n          LPVOID   pvReserved,  \n    [out] HMODULE *phModDll  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `szDllName`  \n [in] A zero-terminated string that represents the name of the DLL to be loaded from the .NET Framework library.  \n  \n `szVersion`  \n [in] A zero-terminated string that represents the version of the DLL to be loaded. If `szVersion` is null, the version selected for loading is the latest version of the specified DLL that is less than version 4. That is, all versions equal to or greater than version 4 are ignored if `szVersion` is null, and if no version less than version 4 is installed, the DLL fails to load. This is to ensure that installation of the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] does not affect pre-existing applications or components. See the entry [In-Proc SxS and Migration Quick Start](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=200329) in the CLR team blog.  \n  \n `pvReserved`  \n Reserved for future use.  \n  \n `phModDll`  \n [out] A pointer to the handle of the module.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n This method returns standard Component Object Model (COM) error codes, as defined in WinError.h, in addition to the following values.  \n  \n|Return code|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|The method completed successfully.|  \n|CLR_E_SHIM_RUNTIMELOAD|Loading `szDllName` requires loading the common language runtime (CLR), and the necessary version of the CLR cannot be loaded.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n This function is used to load DLLs that are included in the .NET Framework redistributable package. It does not load user-generated DLLs.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Beginning with the .NET Framework version 2.0, loading Fusion.dll causes the CLR to be loaded.
