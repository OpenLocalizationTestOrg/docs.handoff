This topic demonstrates how to create an activity that writes two messages to the console.\n\n### To create a custom Activity using the activity designer\n\n1.  Open Visual Studio 2012.\n\n2.  Select File, New, Project. Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node. Select **Activity Library** in the **Templates** window. Name the new project HelloActivity.\n\n3.  Open the new activity.  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface.\n\n4.  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. Enter `\"Hello World\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field.\n\n5.  Drag a second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, below the first one. Enter `\"Goodbye\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,136],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 7b7b1c66-f093-43c3-b4d1-7173b46516da","nodes":[{"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","nodes":[{"pos":[0,52],"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","nodes":[{"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","pos":[0,52]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[143,195],"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","linkify":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","nodes":[{"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","pos":[0,52]}]},{"content":"The most basic way to create an activity using Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)]</ph> is to create a class that inherits from <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Activity&gt;</ph> that creates functionality by assembling custom activities or activities from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Built-In Activity Library<ept id=\"p1\">](net-framework-4-5-built-in-activity-library.md)</ept>.","pos":[196,586],"source":"The most basic way to create an activity using Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] is to create a class that inherits from <xref:System.Activities.Activity> that creates functionality by assembling custom activities or activities from the [Built-In Activity Library](net-framework-4-5-built-in-activity-library.md)."},{"content":"This topic demonstrates how to create an activity that writes two messages to the console.","pos":[587,677]},{"pos":[683,738],"content":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","linkify":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","nodes":[{"content":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"Open Visual Studio 2012.","pos":[744,768]},{"content":"Select File, New, Project.","pos":[774,800]},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Workflow 4.0<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> under <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Visual C#<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> in the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Project Types<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> window, and select the <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>v2010<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept> node.","pos":[801,908],"source":" Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node."},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Activity Library<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Templates<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> window.","pos":[909,965],"source":" Select **Activity Library** in the **Templates** window."},{"content":"Name the new project HelloActivity.","pos":[966,1001]},{"content":"Open the new activity.","pos":[1007,1029]},{"content":"Drag a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface.","pos":[1031,1135],"source":"  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface."},{"content":"Drag a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine&gt;</ph> activity into the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity.","pos":[1141,1266],"source":"Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity."},{"content":"Enter <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"Hello World\"`</ph> (with quotes) into the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field.","pos":[1267,1327],"source":" Enter `\"Hello World\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field."},{"content":"Drag a second <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine&gt;</ph> activity into the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity, below the first one.","pos":[1333,1486],"source":"Drag a second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, below the first one."},{"content":"Enter <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"Goodbye\"`</ph> (with quotes) into the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field.","pos":[1487,1543],"source":" Enter `\"Goodbye\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field."}]}
