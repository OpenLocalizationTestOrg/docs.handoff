Execution continues with the statement following the `Loop` statement. `Exit Do` can be used only inside a `Do` loop. When used within nested `Do` loops, `Exit Do` exits the innermost loop and transfers control to the next higher level of nesting.  \n  \n `Exit For`  \n Immediately exits the `For` loop in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement following the `Next` statement. `Exit For` can be used only inside a `For`...`Next` or `For Each`...`Next` loop. When used within nested `For` loops, `Exit For` exits the innermost loop and transfers control to the next higher level of nesting.  \n  \n `Exit Function`  \n Immediately exits the `Function` procedure in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement following the statement that called the `Function` procedure. `Exit Function` can be used only inside a `Function` procedure.  \n  \n To specify a return value, you can assign the value to the function name on a line before the `Exit Function` statement. To assign the return value and exit the function in one statement, you can instead use the [Return Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md).  \n  \n `Exit Property`  \n Immediately exits the `Property` procedure in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement that called the `Property` procedure, that is, with the statement requesting or setting the property's value. `Exit Property` can be used only inside a property's `Get` or `Set` procedure.  \n  \n To specify a return value in a `Get` procedure, you can assign the value to the function name on a line before the `Exit Property` statement. To assign the return value and exit the `Get` procedure in one statement, you can instead use the `Return` statement.  \n  \n In a `Set` procedure, the `Exit Property` statement is equivalent to the `Return` statement.  \n  \n `Exit Select`  \n Immediately exits the `Select Case` block in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement following the `End Select` statement. `Exit Select` can be used only inside a `Select Case` statement.  \n  \n `Exit Sub`  \n Immediately exits the `Sub` procedure in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement following the statement that called the `Sub` procedure. `Exit Sub` can be used only inside a `Sub` procedure.  \n  \n In a `Sub` procedure, the `Exit Sub` statement is equivalent to the `Return` statement.  \n  \n `Exit Try`  \n Immediately exits the `Try` or `Catch` block in which it appears. Execution continues with the `Finally` block if there is one, or with the statement following the `End Try` statement otherwise. `Exit Try` can be used only inside a `Try` or `Catch` block, and not inside a `Finally` block.  \n  \n `Exit While`  \n Immediately exits the `While` loop in which it appears. Execution continues with the statement following the `End While` statement. `Exit While` can be used only inside a `While` loop. When used within nested `While` loops, `Exit While` transfers control to the loop that is one nested level above the loop where `Exit While` occurs.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Do not confuse `Exit` statements with `End` statements. `Exit` does not define the end of a statement.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the loop condition stops the loop when the `index` variable is greater than 100. The `If` statement in the loop, however, causes the `Exit Do` statement to stop the loop when the index variable is greater than 10.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#133](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/exit-statement_1.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example assigns the return value to the function name `myFunction`, and then uses `Exit Function` to return from the function.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#23](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/exit-statement_2.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the [Return Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md) to assign the return value and exit the function.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#24](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/exit-statement_3.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Continue Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/continue-statement.md)   \n [Do...Loop Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/do-loop-statement.md)   \n [End
