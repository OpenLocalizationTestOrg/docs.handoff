Because the methods of these objects are static or shared members, you can use them directly without creating an instance of the class first. Associated with these classes are the <xref:System.IO.FileInfo> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo> classes, which will be familiar to users of the `My` feature. To use these classes, you must fully qualify the names or import the appropriate namespaces by including the `Imports` statement(s) at the beginning of the affected code. For more information, see [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Other topics in this section use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object instead of `System.IO` classes to work with drives, files, and directories. The `My.Computer.FileSystem` object is intended primarily for use in Visual Basic programs. `System.IO` classes are intended for use by any language that supports the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], including Visual Basic.\n\n## Definition of a Stream\n\nThe [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] uses streams to support reading from and writing to files. You can think of a stream as a one-dimensional set of contiguous data, which has a beginning and an end, and where the cursor indicates the current position in the stream.\n\n![Cursor shows current position in the filestream.](./media/basics-of-net-framework-file-io-and-the-file-system/filestream-cursor-position.gif)\n\n## Stream Operations\n\nThe data contained in the stream may come from memory, a file, or a TCP/IP socket. Streams have fundamental operations that can be applied to them:\n\n- **Reading**. You can read from a stream, transferring data from the stream into a data structure, such as a string or an array of bytes.\n\n- **Writing**. You can write to a stream, transferring data from a data source into the stream.\n\n- **Seeking**. You can query and modify your position in the stream.\n\nFor more information, see [Composing Streams](../../../../standard/io/composing-streams.md).\n\n## Types of Streams\n\nIn the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], a stream is represented by the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class, which forms the abstract class for all other streams. You cannot directly create an instance of the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class, but must use one of the classes it implements.\n\nThere are many types of streams, but for the purposes of working with file input/output (I/O), the most important types are the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> class, which provides a way to read from and write to files, and the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream> class, which provides a way to create files and directories in isolated storage. Other streams that can be used when working with file I/O include:\n\n- <xref:System.IO.BufferedStream>\n\n- <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream>\n\n- <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream>\n\n- <xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream>.\n\nThe following table lists tasks commonly accomplished with a stream:\n\n|To|See|\n|---|---|\n|Read and write to a data file|[How to: Read and Write to a Newly Created Data File](../../../../standard/io/how-to-read-and-write-to-a-newly-created-data-file.md)|\n|Read text from a file|[How to: Read Text from a File](../../../../standard/io/how-to-read-text-from-a-file.md)|\n|Write text to a file|[How to: Write Text to a File](../../../../standard/io/how-to-write-text-to-a-file.md)|\n|Read characters from a string|[How to: Read Characters from a String](../../../../standard/io/how-to-read-characters-from-a-string.md)|\n|Write characters to a string|[How to: Write Characters to a String](../../../../standard/io/how-to-write-characters-to-a-string.md)|\n|Encrypt data|[Encrypting Data](../../../../standard/security/encrypting-data.md)|\n|Decrypt data|[Decrypting Data](../../../../standard/security/decrypting-data.md)|\n\n## File Access and Attributes\n\nYou can control how files are created, opened, and shared with the <xref:System.IO.FileAccess>, <xref:System.IO.FileMode>, and <xref:System.IO.FileShare> enumerations, which contain the flags used by the constructors of the <xref:System.IO.FileStream> class. For example, when you open or create a new <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, the <xref:System.IO.FileMode> enumeration allows you to specify whether the file is opened for appending, whether a new file is created if the specified file does not exist, whether the file is overwritten, and so forth.\n\nThe <xref:System.IO.FileAttributes> enumeration enables the gathering of file-specific information. The <xref:System.IO.FileAttributes> enumeration returns the file's stored attributes, such as whether it is compressed, encrypted, hidden, read-only, an archive, a directory, a system file, or a temporary file.\n\nThe following table lists tasks involving file access and file attributes:\n\n|To|See|\n|---|---|\n|Open and append text to a log file|[How to: Open and Append to a Log File](../../../../standard/io/how-to-open-and-append-to-a-log-file.md)|\n|Determine the attributes of a file|<xref:System.IO.FileAttributes>|\n\n## File Permissions\n\nControlling access to files and directories can be done with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission> class. This may be particularly important for developers working with Web Forms, which by default run within the context of a special local user account named ASPNET, which is created as part of the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](~/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] installations. When such an application requests access to a resource, the ASPNET user account has limited permissions, which may prevent the user from performing actions such as writing to a file from a Web application. For more information, see <xref:System.Security.Permissions.FileIOPermission>.\n\n## Isolated File Storage\n\nIsolated storage is an attempt to solve problems created when working with files where the user or code may lack necessary permissions. Isolated storage assigns each user a data compartment, which can hold one or more stores. Stores can be isolated from each other by user and by assembly. Only the user and assembly that created a store have access to it. A store acts as a complete virtual file systemâ€”within one store you can create and manipulate directories and files.\n\nThe following table lists tasks commonly associated with isolated file storage.\n\n|To|See|\n|---|---|\n|Create an isolated store|[How to: Obtain Stores for Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-obtain-stores-for-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Enumerate isolated stores|[How to: Enumerate Stores for Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-enumerate-stores-for-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Delete an isolated store|[How to: Delete Stores in Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-delete-stores-in-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Create a file or directory in isolated storage|[How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-create-files-and-directories-in-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Find a file in isolated storage|[How to: Find Existing Files and Directories in Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-find-existing-files-and-directories-in-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Read from or write to a file in isolated storage|[How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-read-and-write-to-files-in-isolated-storage.md)|\n|Delete a file or directory in isolated storage|[How to: Delete Files and Directories in Isolated Storage](../../../../standard/io/how-to-delete-files-and-directories-in-isolated-storage.md)|\n\n## File Events\n\nThe <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher> component allows you to watch for changes in files and directories on your system or on any computer to which you have network access. For example, if a file is modified, you might want to send a user an alert that the change has taken place. When changes occur, one or more events are raised, stored in a buffer, and handed to the <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher> component for processing.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Composing Streams](../../../../standard/io/composing-streams.md)\n- [File and Stream I/O](../../../../standard/io/index.md)\n- [Asynchronous File I/O](../../../../standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o.md)\n- [Classes Used in .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/classes-used-in-net-framework-file-io-and-the-file-system.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,351],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"file access, file I/O in Visual Basic\"\n  - \"file attributes, determining\"\n  - \"streams, fundamental operations\"\n  - \"file permissions\"\n  - \"streams\"\n  - \"streams, definition\"\nms.assetid: 49d837c0-cf28-416f-8606-4d83d7b479ef","nodes":[{"content":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,68]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[359,427],"content":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[429,524],"content":"Classes in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO&gt;</ph> namespace are used to work with drives, files, and directories.","source":"Classes in the <xref:System.IO> namespace are used to work with drives, files, and directories."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO&gt;</ph> namespace contains the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.File&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Directory&gt;</ph> classes, which provide the <ph id=\"ph4\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> functionality that manipulates files and directories.","pos":[526,757],"source":"The <xref:System.IO> namespace contains the <xref:System.IO.File> and <xref:System.IO.Directory> classes, which provide the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] functionality that manipulates files and directories."},{"content":"Because the methods of these objects are static or shared members, you can use them directly without creating an instance of the class first.","pos":[758,899]},{"content":"Associated with these classes are the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.FileInfo&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo&gt;</ph> classes, which will be familiar to users of the <ph id=\"ph3\">`My`</ph> feature.","pos":[900,1060],"source":" Associated with these classes are the <xref:System.IO.FileInfo> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo> classes, which will be familiar to users of the `My` feature."},{"content":"To use these classes, you must fully qualify the names or import the appropriate namespaces by including the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Imports`</ph> statement(s) at the beginning of the affected code.","pos":[1061,1231],"source":" To use these classes, you must fully qualify the names or import the appropriate namespaces by including the `Imports` statement(s) at the beginning of the affected code."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md)</ept>.","pos":[1232,1404],"source":" For more information, see [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md)."},{"pos":[1408,1808],"content":"[!NOTE]\nOther topics in this section use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object instead of `System.IO` classes to work with drives, files, and directories.
