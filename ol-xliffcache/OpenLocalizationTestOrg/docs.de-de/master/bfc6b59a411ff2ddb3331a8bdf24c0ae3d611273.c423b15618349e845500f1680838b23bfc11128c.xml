An interface can contain methods, properties, events, and indexers. An interface does not provide implementations of the members it defines—it merely specifies the members that must be supplied by classes or structs that implement the interface.\n\nInterfaces may employ ***multiple inheritance***. In the following example, the interface `IComboBox` inherits from both `ITextBox` and `IListBox`.\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesOne](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L5-L17)]\n\nClasses and structs can implement multiple interfaces. In the following example, the class `EditBox` implements both `IControl` and `IDataBound`.\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesTwo](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L19-L27)]\n\nWhen a class or struct implements a particular interface, instances of that class or struct can be implicitly converted to that interface type. For example\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesThree](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L33-L35)]\n\nIn cases where an instance is not statically known to implement a particular interface, dynamic type casts can be used. For example, the following statements use dynamic type casts to obtain an object’s `IControl` and `IDataBound` interface implementations. Because the run-time actual type of the object is `EditBox`, the casts succeed.\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesFour](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L40-L42)]\n\nIn the previous `EditBox` class, the `Paint` method from the `IControl` interface and the `Bind` method from the `IDataBound` interface are implemented using public members. C# also supports explicit ***interface member implementations***, enabling the class or struct to avoid making the members public. An explicit interface member implementation is written using the fully qualified interface member name. For example, the `EditBox` class could implement the `IControl.Paint` and `IDataBound.Bind` methods using explicit interface member implementations as follows.\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesFive](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L60-L64)]\n\nExplicit interface members can only be accessed via the interface type. For example, the implementation of `IControl.Paint` provided by the previous EditBox class can only be invoked by first converting the `EditBox` reference to the `IControl` interface type.\n\n[!code-csharp[InterfacesFive](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/interfaces/Program.cs#L71-L74)]\n\n>[!div
