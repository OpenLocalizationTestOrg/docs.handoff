Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,76],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[385,432],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","linkify":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures","pos":[433,494]},{"pos":[503,514],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[518,662]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[663,685]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[695,740]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[750,817]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[827,906]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[916,1004]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[1014,1048]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[1058,1167]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[1177,1230]}]}
