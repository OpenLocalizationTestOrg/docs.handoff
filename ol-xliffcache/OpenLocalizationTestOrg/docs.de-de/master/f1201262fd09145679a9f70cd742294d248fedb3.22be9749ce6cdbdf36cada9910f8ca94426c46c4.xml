If the filters are misconfigured, the logs might contain the wrong information. For more information about filtering, see [Walkthrough: Filtering My.Application.Log Output](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-filtering-my-application-log-output.md).  \n  \n However, if a log is configured incorrectly, you may need more information about its current configuration. You can get to this information through the log's advanced `TraceSource` property.  \n  \n### To determine the log listeners for the Log object in code  \n  \n1.  Import the <xref:System.Diagnostics> namespace at the beginning of the code file. For more information, see [Imports Statement (.NET Namespace and Type)](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/imports-statement-net-namespace-and-type.md).  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyApplicationLog#13](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyApplicationLog/VB/Form1.vb#13)]  \n  \n2.
