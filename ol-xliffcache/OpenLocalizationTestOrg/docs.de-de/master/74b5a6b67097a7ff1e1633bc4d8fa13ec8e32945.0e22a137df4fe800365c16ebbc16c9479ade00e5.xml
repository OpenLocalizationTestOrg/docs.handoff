The custom activity included in this sample functions like the C# `for` statement. T  \n  \n The `For` custom activity has properties named `InitAction`, `IterationAction`, `Condition`, and `Body` that correspond to the initialization statement, iterative statement, continuation condition, and body statement respectively found in the standard C# `For` statement.  \n  \n The following table describes the key files in the sample.  \n  \n|File|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|For.cs|Class definition for the `For` custom activity, which extends the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> class to provide the functionality of the C# `For` statement.|  \n|Program.cs|A client application that performs basic iterative work on a collection using the custom `For` activity.|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When using the `For` custom activity, ensure that the `Condition` property is set; otherwise an infinite loop could occur.  \n  \n## Demonstrates  \n Create a custom activity that inherits from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>.  \n  \n## Discussion  \n The following table describes the properties of the activity included in this sample.  \n  \n InitAction  \n Initialization statement  \n  \n IterationAction  \n Iterative statement  \n  \n Condition  \n Continuation statement  \n  \n Body  \n Body statement  \n  \n The activity inherits from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> to gain access to runtime features such as scheduling additional activities to run, using one of the `ScheduleActivity` methods of <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext>.  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open the For.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  Build the solution, by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  Run the solution, by pressing F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
