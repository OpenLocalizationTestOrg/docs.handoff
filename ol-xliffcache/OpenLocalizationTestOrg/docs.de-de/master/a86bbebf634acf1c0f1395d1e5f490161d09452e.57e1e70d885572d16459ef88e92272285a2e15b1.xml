Move the `Resume`statement into an error handler, or delete it.  \n  \n2.  Jumps to labels cannot occur across procedures, so search the procedure for the label that identifies the error handler. If you find a duplicate label specified as the target of a `GoTo` statement that isn't an `On Error GoTo` statement, change the line label to agree with its intended target.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Resume Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/resume-statement.md)   \n [On Error Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/on-error-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,49],"content":"Resume without error | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Resume without error | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]},{"pos":[536,556],"content":"Resume without error","linkify":"Resume without error","nodes":[{"content":"Resume without error","pos":[0,20]}]},{"pos":[557,688],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`Resume`</ph> statement appeared outside error-handling code, or the code jumped into an error handler even though there was no error.","source":"A `Resume` statement appeared outside error-handling code, or the code jumped into an error handler even though there was no error."},{"pos":[697,718],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[728,791],"content":"Move the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Resume`</ph>statement into an error handler, or delete it.","source":"Move the `Resume`statement into an error handler, or delete it."},{"content":"Jumps to labels cannot occur across procedures, so search the procedure for the label that identifies the error handler.","pos":[801,921]},{"content":"If you find a duplicate label specified as the target of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`GoTo`</ph> statement that isn't an <ph id=\"ph2\">`On Error GoTo`</ph> statement, change the line label to agree with its intended target.","pos":[922,1095],"source":" If you find a duplicate label specified as the target of a `GoTo` statement that isn't an `On Error GoTo` statement, change the line label to agree with its intended target."},{"pos":[1104,1112],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Resume Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/resume-statement.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1116,1208],"source":"[Resume Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/resume-statement.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>On Error Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/on-error-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1211,1307],"source":" [On Error Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/on-error-statement.md)"}]}
