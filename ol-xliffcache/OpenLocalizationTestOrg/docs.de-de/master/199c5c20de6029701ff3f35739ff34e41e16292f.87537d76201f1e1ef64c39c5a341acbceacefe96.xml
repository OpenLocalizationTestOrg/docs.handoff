[!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] sessions in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, see [Using Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-sessions.md).  \n  \n### To specify that a contract require its binding to support sessions  \n  \n1.  Create a service contract with at least one operation. For an example of how to create a service contract, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md).  \n  \n2.  Modify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> that declares the contract by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to either:  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract must be run within a session.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract can be run within a session.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode?displayProperty=fullName> if this contract must not be run within a session.  \n  \n3.  Configure your service endpoint to use a binding that supports sessions. The following configuration example shows the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding?displayProperty=fullName>, which supports a WS`-`ReliableMessaging session.  \n  \n
