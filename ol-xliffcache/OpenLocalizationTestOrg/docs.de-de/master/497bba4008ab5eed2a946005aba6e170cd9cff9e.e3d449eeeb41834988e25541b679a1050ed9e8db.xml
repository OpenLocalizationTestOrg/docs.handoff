However, the patterns demonstrated in this sample can be used with all of the Syndication classes that support extension data.  \n  \n The Syndication object model (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationItem>, and related classes) supports loosely-typed access to extension data by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.AttributeExtensions%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.ElementExtensions%2A> properties. This sample shows how to provide strongly-typed access to extension data by implementing custom derived classes of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationItem> that make available certain application-specific extensions as strongly-typed properties.  \n  \n As an example, this sample shows how to implement an extension element defined in the proposed Atom Threading Extensions RFC. This is for demonstration purposes only and this sample is not intended to be a full implementation of the proposed specification.  \n  \n## Sample XML  \n The following XML example shows an Atom 1.0 entry with an additional `<in-reply-to>` extension element.  \n  \n```xml  \n<entry>  \n    <id>tag:example.org,2005:1,2</id>  \n    <title type=\"text\">Another response to the original</title>  \n    <summary type=\"text\">  \n         This is a response to the original entry</summary>  \n    <updated>2006-03-01T12:12:13Z</updated>  \n    <link href=\"http://www.example.org/entries/1/2\" />  \n    <in-reply-to p3:ref=\"tag:example.org,2005:1\"   \n                 p3:href=\"http://www.example.org/entries/1\"   \n                 p3:type=\"application/xhtml+xml\"   \n                 xmlns:p3=\"http://contoso.org/syndication/thread/1.0\"   \n                 xmlns=\"http://contoso.org/syndication/thread/1.0\">  \n      <anotherElement xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">  \n                     Some more data</anotherElement>  \n      <aDifferentElement xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">  \n                     Even more data</aDifferentElement>  \n    </in-reply-to>  \n</entry>  \n```  \n  \n The `<in-reply-to>` element specifies three required attributes (`ref`, `type` and `href`) while also allowing for the presence of additional extension attributes and extension elements.  \n  \n## Modeling the In-Reply-To element  \n In this sample, the `<in-reply-to>` element is modeled as CLR that implements <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable>, which enables its use with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>. It also implements some methods and properties for accessing the elementâ€™s data, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \n[XmlRoot(ElementName = \"in-reply-to\", Namespace = \"http://contoso.org/syndication/thread/1.0\")]  \npublic class InReplyToElement : IXmlSerializable  \n{  \n    internal const string ElementName = \"in-reply-to\";  \n    internal const string NsUri =   \n                  \"http://contoso.org/syndication/thread/1.0\";  \n    private Dictionary<XmlQualifiedName, string> extensionAttributes;  \n    private Collection<XElement> extensionElements;  \n  \n    public InReplyToElement()  \n    {  \n        this.extensionElements = new Collection<XElement>();  \n        this.extensionAttributes = new Dictionary<XmlQualifiedName,   \n                                                          string>();  \n    }  \n  \n    public Dictionary<XmlQualifiedName, string> AttributeExtensions  \n    {  \n        get { return this.extensionAttributes; }  \n    }  \n  \n    public Collection<XElement> ElementExtensions  \n    {  \n        get { return this.extensionElements; }  \n    }  \n  \n    public Uri Href  \n    { get; set; }  \n  \n    public string MediaType  \n    { get; set; }  \n  \n    public string Ref  \n    { get; set; }  \n  \n    public Uri Source  \n    { get; set; }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The `InReplyToElement` class implements properties for the required attribute (`HRef`, `MediaType`, and `Source`) as well as collections to hold <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.AttributeExtensions%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.ElementExtensions%2A>.  \n  \n The `InReplyToElement` class implements the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.IXmlSerializable> interface, which allows direct control over how object instances are read from and written to XML. The `ReadXml` method first reads the values for the `Ref`, `HRef`, `Source`, and `MediaType` properties from the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> passed to it. Any unknown attributes are stored in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.AttributeExtensions%2A> collection. When all the attributes have been read, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadStartElement> is called to advance the reader to the next element. Because the element modeled by this class has no required children, the child elements get buffered into `XElement` instances and stored in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.ElementExtensions%2A> collection, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n```  \npublic void ReadXml(System.Xml.XmlReader reader)  \n{  \n    bool isEmpty = reader.IsEmptyElement;  \n  \n    if (reader.HasAttributes)  \n    {  \n        for (int i = 0; i < reader.AttributeCount; i++)  \n        {  \n            reader.MoveToNextAttribute();  \n  \n            if (reader.NamespaceURI == \"\")  \n            {  \n                if (reader.LocalName == \"ref\")  \n                {  \n                    this.Ref = reader.Value;  \n                }  \n                else if (reader.LocalName == \"href\")  \n                {  \n                    this.Href = new Uri(reader.Value);  \n                }  \n                else if (reader.LocalName == \"source\")  \n                {  \n                    this.Source = new Uri(reader.Value);  \n                }  \n                else if (reader.LocalName == \"type\")  \n                {  \n                    this.MediaType = reader.Value;  \n                }  \n                else  \n                {  \n                    this.AttributeExtensions.Add(new   \n                                 XmlQualifiedName(reader.LocalName,   \n                                 reader.NamespaceURI),   \n                                 reader.Value);  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    reader.ReadStartElement();  \n  \n    if (!isEmpty)  \n    {  \n        while (reader.IsStartElement())  \n        {  \n            ElementExtensions.Add(  \n                  (XElement) XElement.ReadFrom(reader));  \n        }  \n        reader.ReadEndElement();  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n In `WriteXml`, the `InReplyToElement` method first writes out the values of the `Ref`, `HRef`, `Source`, and `MediaType` properties as XML attributes (`WriteXml` is not responsible for writing the actual outer element itself, as that done by the caller of `WriteXml`). It also writes the contents of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.AttributeExtensions%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.SyndicationFeed.ElementExtensions%2A> to the writer, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n```  \npublic void WriteXml(System.Xml.XmlWriter writer)  \n{  \n    if (this.Ref != null)  \n    {  \n        writer.WriteAttributeString(\"ref\", InReplyToElement.NsUri,   \n                                            this.Ref);  \n    }  \n    if (this.Href != null)  \n    {  \n        writer.WriteAttributeString(\"href\", InReplyToElement.NsUri,   \n                                                this.Href.ToString());  \n    }  \n    if (this.Source != null)  \n    {  \n        writer.WriteAttributeString(\"source\", InReplyToElement.NsUri,   \n                                              this.Source.ToString());  \n    }  \n    if (this.MediaType != null)  \n    {  \n        writer.WriteAttributeString(\"type\", InReplyToElement.NsUri,   \n                                                    this.MediaType);  \n    }  \n  \n    foreach (KeyValuePair<XmlQualifiedName, string> kvp in   \n                                             this.AttributeExtensions)  \n    {  \n        writer.WriteAttributeString(kvp.Key.Name, kvp.Key.Namespace,   \n                                                   kvp.Value);  \n    }  \n  \n    foreach (XElement element in this.ElementExtensions)  \n    {  \n        element.WriteTo(writer);  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## ThreadedFeed and ThreadedItem  \n In the sample, `SyndicationItems` with `InReplyTo` extensions are modeled by the `ThreadedItem` class. Similarly, the `ThreadedFeed` class is a `SyndicationFeed` whose items are all instances of `ThreadedItem`.  \n  \n The `ThreadedFeed` class inherits from `SyndicationFeed` and overrides `OnCreateItem` to return a `ThreadedItem`. It also implements a method for accessing the `Items` collection as `ThreadedItems`, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n```  \npublic class ThreadedFeed : SyndicationFeed  \n{  \n    public ThreadedFeed()  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    public IEnumerable<ThreadedItem> ThreadedItems  \n    {  \n        get  \n        {  \n            return this.Items.Cast<ThreadedItem>();  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    protected override SyndicationItem CreateItem()  \n    {  \n        return new ThreadedItem();  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The class `ThreadedItem` inherits from `SyndicationItem` and makes `InReplyToElement` as a strongly-typed property. This provides for convenient programmatic access to the `InReplyTo` extension data. It also implements `TryParseElement` and `WriteElementExtensions` for reading and writing its extension data, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n```  \npublic class ThreadedItem : SyndicationItem  \n{  \n    private InReplyToElement inReplyTo;  \n    // Constructors  \n        public ThreadedItem()  \n        {  \n            inReplyTo = new InReplyToElement();  \n        }  \n  \n        public ThreadedItem(string title, string content, Uri itemAlternateLink, string id, DateTimeOffset lastUpdatedTime) : base(title, content, itemAlternateLink, id, lastUpdatedTime)  \n        {  \n            inReplyTo = new InReplyToElement();  \n        }  \n  \n    public InReplyToElement InReplyTo  \n    {  \n        get { return this.inReplyTo; }  \n    }  \n  \n    protected override bool TryParseElement(  \n                        System.Xml.XmlReader reader,   \n                        string version)  \n    {  \n        if (version == SyndicationVersions.Atom10 &&  \n            reader.NamespaceURI == InReplyToElement.NsUri &&  \n            reader.LocalName == InReplyToElement.ElementName)  \n        {  \n            this.inReplyTo = new InReplyToElement();  \n  \n            this.InReplyTo.ReadXml(reader);  \n  \n            return true;  \n        }  \n        else  \n        {  \n            return base.TryParseElement(reader, version);  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    protected override void WriteElementExtensions(XmlWriter writer,   \n                                                 string version)  \n    {  \n        if (this.InReplyTo != null &&   \n                     version == SyndicationVersions.Atom10)  \n        {  \n            writer.WriteStartElement(InReplyToElement.ElementName,   \n                                           InReplyToElement.NsUri);  \n            this.InReplyTo.WriteXml(writer);  \n            writer.WriteEndElement();  \n        }  \n  \n        base.WriteElementExtensions(writer, version);  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.
