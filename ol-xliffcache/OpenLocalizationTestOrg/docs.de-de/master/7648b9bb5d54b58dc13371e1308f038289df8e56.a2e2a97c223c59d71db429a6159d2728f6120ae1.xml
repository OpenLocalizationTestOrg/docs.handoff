Therefore, the `bool?` type cannot be used in conditionals such as with `if`, `for`, or `while`. For example, the following code causes a compiler error.  \n  \n```  \nbool? b = null;  \nif (b) // Error CS0266.  \n{  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This is not allowed because it is unclear what `null` means in the context of a conditional. To use a `bool?` in a conditional statement, first check its <xref:System.Nullable%601.HasValue%2A> property to ensure that its value is not `null`, and then cast it to `bool`. For more information, see [bool](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/bool.md). If you perform the cast on a `bool?` with a value of `null`, a <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> will be thrown in the conditional test. The following example shows one way to safely cast from `bool?` to `bool`:  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \nbool? test = null;  \n// Other code that may or may not  \n// give a value to test.  \nif(!test.HasValue) //check for a value  \n{  \n    // Assume that IsInitialized  \n    // returns either true or false.  \n    test = IsInitialized();  \n}  \nif((bool)test) //now this cast is safe  \n{  \n   // Do something.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Literal Keywords](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/literal-keywords.md)   \n [Nullable Types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/index.md)   \n [??
