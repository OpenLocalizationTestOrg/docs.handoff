Thus, clicking a toolbar button is equivalent to choosing a menu command. The buttons can be configured to appear and behave as push buttons, drop-down menus, or separators. Typically, a toolbar contains buttons and menus that correspond to items in an application's menu structure, providing quick access to an application's most frequently used functions and commands.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `ToolBar` control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBarButton.DropDownMenu%2A> property takes an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> class as a reference. Carefully consider the reference you pass when implementing this sort of button on toolbars in your application, as the property will accept any object that inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Menu> class.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ToolBar Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/toolbar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `ToolBar` control, which allows you to design custom toolbars that your users can work with.  \n  \n [How to: Add Buttons to a ToolBar Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-buttons-to-a-toolbar-control.md)  \n Describes how to add buttons to a `ToolBar` control.  \n  \n [How to: Define an Icon for a ToolBar Button](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-define-an-icon-for-a-toolbar-button.md)  \n Describes how to display icons within a `ToolBar` control's buttons.  \n  \n [How to: Trigger Menu Events for Toolbar Buttons](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-trigger-menu-events-for-toolbar-buttons.md)  \n Gives directions on writing code to interpret which button the user clicks in a `ToolBar` control.  \n  \n Also see [How to: Define an Icon for a ToolBar Button Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233659\\(v=vs.110\\)), [How to: Add Buttons to a ToolBar Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233650\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar> class  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [ToolStrip Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/toolstrip-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes toolbars that can host menus, controls, and user controls in Windows Forms applications.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,60],"content":"ToolBar Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ToolBar Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[489,520],"content":"ToolBar Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"ToolBar Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"ToolBar Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,31]}]},{"pos":[523,747],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control replaces and adds functionality to the `ToolBar` control; however, the `ToolBar` control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip&gt;</ph> control replaces and adds functionality to the <ph id=\"ph2\">`ToolBar`</ph> control; however, the <ph id=\"ph3\">`ToolBar`</ph> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.","pos":[9,222],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control replaces and adds functionality to the `ToolBar` control; however, the `ToolBar` control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose."}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`ToolBar`</ph> control is used on forms as a control bar that displays a row of drop-down menus and bitmapped buttons that activate commands.","pos":[754,908],"source":"The Windows Forms `ToolBar` control is used on forms as a control bar that displays a row of drop-down menus and bitmapped buttons that activate commands."},{"content":"Thus, clicking a toolbar button is equivalent to choosing a menu command.","pos":[909,982]},{"content":"The buttons can be configured to appear and behave as push buttons, drop-down menus, or separators.","pos":[983,1082]},{"content":"Typically, a toolbar contains buttons and menus that correspond to items in an application's menu structure, providing quick access to an application's most frequently used functions and commands.","pos":[1083,1279]},{"pos":[1287,1690],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `ToolBar` control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBarButton.DropDownMenu%2A> property takes an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> class as a reference.
