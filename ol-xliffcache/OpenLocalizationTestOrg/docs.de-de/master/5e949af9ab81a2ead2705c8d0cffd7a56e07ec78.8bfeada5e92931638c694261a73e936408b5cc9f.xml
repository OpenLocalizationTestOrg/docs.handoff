Some common examples include the following:  \n  \n-   A try to instantiate a namespace (instead of a class)  \n  \n-   A try to call a field (instead of a method)  \n  \n-   A try to use a type as a variable  \n  \n-   A try to use an extern alias as a type.  \n  \n To resolve this error, make sure that the operation you are performing is valid for the type you are performing the operation on.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0118.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0118.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \nnamespace MyNamespace  \n{  \n   class MyClass  \n   {  \n      // MyNamespace not a class  \n      MyNamespace ix = new MyNamespace ();   // CS0118  \n   }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0118\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0118\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0118\"\nms.assetid: 9a612432-6e56-4e9b-9d8c-7d7b43f58c1a","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0118","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'construct1_name' is a 'construct1' but is used like a 'construct2'","pos":[194,261]},{"content":"The compiler detected a situation in which a construct was used in some erroneous way or a disallowed operation was tried on a construct.","pos":[268,405]},{"content":"Some common examples include the following:","pos":[406,449]},{"content":"A try to instantiate a namespace (instead of a class)","pos":[459,512]},{"content":"A try to call a field (instead of a method)","pos":[522,565]},{"content":"A try to use a type as a variable","pos":[575,608]},{"content":"A try to use an extern alias as a type.","pos":[618,657]},{"content":"To resolve this error, make sure that the operation you are performing is valid for the type you are performing the operation on.","pos":[664,793]},{"pos":[802,809],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0118.","pos":[813,851]}]}
