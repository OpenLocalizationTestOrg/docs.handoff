Instead, you eliminate the exception by adding entries to your [runtime directives file](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md).

(Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string HelpLink { get; set; }`|Gets or sets a link to the help file associated with this exception.

(Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string Message { get; }`|Gets a message that describes the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string Source { get; set; }`|Gets or sets the name of the application or object that caused the error. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string StackTrace { get; }`|Gets a string representation of the immediate frames on the call stack. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public MethodBase TargetSite { get; }`|Gets the method that threw the current exception.

(Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  \n|`public Exception GetBaseException()`|Returns the exception that is the root cause of one or more subsequent exceptions. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public int GetHashCode()`|Returns a hash code for a `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` instance.   (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  \n|`public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`|Sets a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo> object with information about the exception.

(Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n  \n## Usage Details  \n The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` exception is thrown when an attempt is made to instantiate a type or invoke a type member and, although the type or member's metadata is present, its implementation has been removed.  \n  \n Whether metadata and the implementation code to dynamically execute a method are available to an app at run time is defined by the runtime directives (XML configuration) file, *.rd.xml. To prevent your app from throwing this exception, you must modify \\*.rd.xml to ensure that the metadata needed by a type or type member is present at run time. For information about the format of the \\*.rd.xml file, see [Runtime Directives (rd.xml) Configuration File Reference](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Because this exception indicates that the implementation code needed by your application isn’t available at run time, you shouldn’t handle this exception in a `try`/`catch` block. Instead, you should diagnose the cause of the exception and eliminate it by using a runtime directives file. Typically, you eliminate this exception by specifying the appropriate `Activate` or `Dynamic` policy for a program element in the runtime directives file (*.rd.xml file). To get the entry that you can add to your runtime directives file that eliminates the exception, you can use one of two troubleshooters:  \n>   \n>  -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/type.html) for types.  \n> -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/method.html) for methods.  \n  \n The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class contains no unique members; all of its members are inherited from its base class, <xref:System.MemberAccessException>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Runtime Directives (rd.xml) Configuration File Reference](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md)   \n [Runtime Directive Policy Settings](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directive-policy-settings.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,376],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: d5b3d13e-689f-4584-8ba6-44f5167a8590\ncaps.latest.revision: 8\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,68]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[383,434],"content":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native)","linkify":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native)","nodes":[{"content":"MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class (.NET Native)","pos":[0,51]}]},{"pos":[435,540],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET for Windows apps for Windows 10, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)]</ph> only<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**.NET for Windows apps for Windows 10, [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] only**"},{"content":"The exception that is thrown when metadata for a type or type member is available but its implementation has been removed.","pos":[547,669]},{"pos":[676,708],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Namespace:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> System.Reflection","source":"**Namespace:** System.Reflection"},{"pos":[716,1230],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The `MissingRuntimeArtifactException` class is intended solely for internal use by the [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] tool chain.
