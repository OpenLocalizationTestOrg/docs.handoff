The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores features of the line, such as color and width.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example draws a line from (20, 10) to (300, 100). The first statement uses the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> class constructor to create a black pen. The one argument passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object created with the <xref:System.Drawing.Color.FromArgb%2A> method. The values used to create the <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object — (255, 0, 0, 0) — correspond to the alpha, red, green, and blue components of the color. These values define an opaque black pen.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n
