MSMQ binding attributes of an endpoint element.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Transacted MSMQ Binding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transacted-msmq-binding.md)  \n Demonstrates how to perform transacted queued communication by using Message Queuing (MSMQ).  \n  \n [Volatile Queued Communication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/volatile-queued-communication.md)  \n Demonstrates how to perform volatile queued communication over the Message Queuing (MSMQ) transport.  \n  \n [Dead Letter Queues](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/dead-letter-queues.md)  \n Demonstrates how to handle and process messages that have failed delivery.  \n  \n [Poison Message Handling in MSMQ 4.0](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/poison-message-handling-in-msmq-4-0.md)  \n Demonstrates how to perform poison message handling in a service using MSMQ 4.0.  \n  \n [Sessions and Queues](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/sessions-and-queues.md)  \n Demonstrates how to send and receive a set of related messages in queued communication over the Message Queuing (MSMQ) transport.  \n  \n [Two-Way Communication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/two-way-communication.md)  \n Demonstrates how to perform transacted two-way queued communication over MSMQ.\n  \n [SRMP](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/srmp.md)  \n Demonstrates how to perform transacted queued communication by using Message Queuing (MSMQ) over HTTP.  \n  \n [Message Security over Message Queuing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-over-message-queuing.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement an application that uses WS-Security with X.509v3 certificate authentication for the client and requires server authentication using the server's X.509v3 certificate over MSMQ.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,100],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Net MSMQ
