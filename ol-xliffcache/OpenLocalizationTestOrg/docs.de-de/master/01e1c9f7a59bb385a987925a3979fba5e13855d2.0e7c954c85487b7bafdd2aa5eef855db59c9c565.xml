This topic provides an overview of the drag-and-drop support in Windows Forms.  Also see [Drag-and-Drop Operations and Clipboard Support](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fe5ebfwe\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Performing Drag-and-Drop Operations  \n To perform a drag-and-drop operation, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class. For more information about how a drag-and-drop operation is performed, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A>. To get the rectangle that the mouse pointer must be dragged over before a drag-and-drop operation begins, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DragSize%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class.  \n  \n## Events Related to Drag-and-Drop Operations  \n There are two categories of events in a drag and drop operation: events that occur on the current target of the drag-and-drop operation, and events that occur on the source of the drag and drop operation.  \n  \n### Events on the Current Target  \n The following table shows the events that occur on the current target of a drag-and-drop operation.  \n  \n|Mouse Event|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter>|This event occurs when an object is dragged into the control's bounds. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragOver>|This event occurs when an object is dragged while the mouse pointer is within the control's bounds. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop>|This event occurs when a drag-and-drop operation is completed. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragLeave>|This event occurs when an object is dragged out of the control's bounds. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.EventArgs>.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs> class provides the location of the mouse pointer, the current state of the mouse buttons and modifier keys of the keyboard, the data being dragged, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects> values that specify the operations allowed by the source of the drag event and the target drop effect for the operation.  \n  \n### Events on the Source  \n The following table shows the events that occur on the source of the drag-and-drop operation.  \n  \n|Mouse Event|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.GiveFeedback>|This event occurs during a drag operation. It provides an opportunity to give a visual cue to the user that the drag-and-drop operation is occurring, such as changing the mouse pointer. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GiveFeedbackEventArgs>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.QueryContinueDrag>|This event is raised during a drag-and-drop operation and enables the drag source to determine whether the drag-and-drop operation should be canceled. The handler for this event receives an argument of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.QueryContinueDragEventArgs>.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.QueryContinueDragEventArgs> class provides the current state of the mouse buttons and modifier keys of the keyboard, a value specifying whether the ESC key was pressed, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragAction> value that can be set to specify whether the drag-and-drop operation should continue.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Mouse Input in a Windows Forms
