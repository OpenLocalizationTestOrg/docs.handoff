The garbage collector currently uses three generations, numbered 0, 1, and 2, plus a special heap segment that is used for large objects. Objects whose size is larger than a particular value are stored in the large-object heap. Other allocated objects start out belonging to generation 0. All objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 0 are promoted to generation 1. Objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 1 move into generation 2.  \n  \n The use of generations means that the garbage collector has to work with only a subset of the allocated objects at any one time.  \n  \n The `COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION` enumeration is used by the [COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md) structure.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Profiling Enumerations](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-enumerations.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[640,673],"content":"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration","linkify":"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration","nodes":[{"content":"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Identifies a garbage-collection generation.","pos":[674,717]},{"pos":[726,732],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[923,930],"content":"Members","linkify":"Members","nodes":[{"content":"Members","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Member","pos":[937,943]},{"content":"Description","pos":[944,955]},{"content":"The object is stored as generation 0.","pos":[1014,1051]},{"content":"The object is stored as generation 1.","pos":[1075,1112]},{"content":"The object is stored as generation 2.","pos":[1136,1173]},{"content":"The object is stored in the large-object heap.","pos":[1209,1255]},{"pos":[1265,1272],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The garbage collector improves memory management performance by dividing objects into generations based on age.","pos":[1276,1387]},{"content":"The garbage collector currently uses three generations, numbered 0, 1, and 2, plus a special heap segment that is used for large objects.","pos":[1388,1525]},{"content":"Objects whose size is larger than a particular value are stored in the large-object heap.","pos":[1526,1615]},{"content":"Other allocated objects start out belonging to generation 0.","pos":[1616,1676]},{"content":"All objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 0 are promoted to generation 1.","pos":[1677,1777]},{"content":"Objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 1 move into generation 2.","pos":[1778,1868]},{"content":"The use of generations means that the garbage collector has to work with only a subset of the allocated objects at any one time.","pos":[1875,2003]},{"pos":[2010,2198],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION`</ph> enumeration is used by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md)</ept> structure.","source":"The `COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION` enumeration is used by the [COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md) structure."},{"pos":[2207,2219],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[2223,2327],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[2334,2368],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorProf.idl, CorProf.h","source":"**Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h"},{"pos":[2375,2400],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorGuids.lib","source":"**Library:** CorGuids.lib"},{"pos":[2407,2515],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]</ph>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]"},{"pos":[2524,2532],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2536,2638],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Profiling Enumerations<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-enumerations.md)</ept>","source":"[Profiling Enumerations](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-enumerations.md)"}]}
