This allows clients to discover a service when a channel is opened.  \n  \n [Discovery Proxy Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-proxy-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create an implementation of a Discovery Proxy to store information about existing services and how clients can query that proxy for information.  \n  \n [Discover a Service with Unique Listen Uri Mode Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discover-a-service-with-unique-listen-uri-mode-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to discover a service that has the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingContext.ListenUriMode%2A> property set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ListenUriMode>.  \n  \n [Discovery with Scopes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-with-scopes-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use scopes to categorize discoverable endpoints as well how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> to perform an asynchronous search for endpoints.  \n  \n [Custom Find Criteria](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-find-criteria.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a custom scope match using logic and how to implement a custom discovery service.  \n  \n [Workflow Discovery Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/workflow-discovery-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to make a workflow service discoverable and how to author a custom code activity that searches for a particular service.  \n  \n [Discovery Router Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-router-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to forward discovery messages to another endpoint.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,48],"content":"Discovery (Samples) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Discovery (Samples) | Microsoft
