Any `String` or `Object` variable.  \n  \n `expression1`  \n Required. Any expression with a data type that widens to `String`.  \n  \n `expression2`  \n Required. Any expression with a data type that widens to `String`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n If the data type of `expression1` or `expression2` is not `String` but widens to `String`, it is converted to `String`. If either of the data types does not widen to `String`, the compiler generates an error.  \n  \n The data type of `result` is `String`. If one or both expressions evaluate to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md) or have a value of <xref:System.DBNull.Value?displayProperty=fullName>, they are treated as a string with a value of \"\".  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `&` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The ampersand (&) character can also be used to identify variables as type `Long`. For more information, see [Type Characters](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-characters.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example uses the `&` operator to force string concatenation. The result is a string value representing the concatenation of the two string operands.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#2](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/concatenation-operator_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [&= Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/and-assignment-operator.md)   \n [Concatenation Operators](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/concatenation-operators.md)   \n [Operator Precedence in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/operator-precedence.md)   \n [Operators Listed by Functionality](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/operators-listed-by-functionality.md)   \n [Concatenation Operators in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/concatenation-operators.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"&amp; Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;amp;</ph> Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46],"source":"&amp; Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[716,745],"content":"&amp; Operator (Visual Basic)","linkify":"&amp; Operator (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;amp;</ph> Operator (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29],"source":"&amp; Operator (Visual Basic)"}]},{"content":"Generates a string concatenation of two expressions.","pos":[746,798]},{"pos":[807,813],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[877,882],"content":"Parts","linkify":"Parts","nodes":[{"content":"Parts","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"Required.","pos":[898,907]},{"content":"Any <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`Object`</ph> variable.","pos":[908,942],"source":" Any `String` or `Object` variable."},{"content":"Required.","pos":[966,975]},{"content":"Any expression with a data type that widens to <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph>.","pos":[976,1032],"source":" Any expression with a data type that widens to `String`."},{"content":"Required.","pos":[1056,1065]},{"content":"Any expression with a data type that widens to <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph>.","pos":[1066,1122],"source":" Any expression with a data type that widens to `String`."},{"pos":[1131,1138],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"If the data type of <ph id=\"ph1\">`expression1`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`expression2`</ph> is not <ph id=\"ph3\">`String`</ph> but widens to <ph id=\"ph4\">`String`</ph>, it is converted to <ph id=\"ph5\">`String`</ph>.","pos":[1142,1261],"source":"If the data type of `expression1` or `expression2` is not `String` but widens to `String`, it is converted to `String`."},{"content":"If either of the data types does not widen to <ph id=\"ph1\">`String`</ph>, the compiler generates an error.","pos":[1262,1350],"source":" If either of the data types does not widen to `String`, the compiler generates an error."},{"content":"The data type of <ph id=\"ph1\">`result`</ph> is <ph id=\"ph2\">`String`</ph>.","pos":[1357,1395],"source":"The data type of `result` is `String`."},{"content":"If one or both expressions evaluate to <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Nothing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md)</ept> or have a value of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.DBNull.Value?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>, they are treated as a string with a value of \"\".","pos":[1396,1618],"source":" If one or both expressions evaluate to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md) or have a value of <xref:System.DBNull.Value?displayProperty=fullName>, they are treated as a string with a value of \"\"."},{"pos":[1626,2046],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `&` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure.
