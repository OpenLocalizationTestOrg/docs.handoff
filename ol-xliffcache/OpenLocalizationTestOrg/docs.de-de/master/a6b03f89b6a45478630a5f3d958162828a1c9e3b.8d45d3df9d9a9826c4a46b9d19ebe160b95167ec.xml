The following values are supported:  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_FORCE_VER` (0x00000001) - Forces verification even if it is necessary to override registry settings.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_INSTALL` (0x00000002) - Specifies that this is the first verification performed on this image.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_ADMIN_ACCESS` (0x00000004) - Specifies that the cache will allow access only to users who have administrative privileges.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_USER_ACCESS` (0x00000008) - Specifies that the assembly will be accessible only to the current user.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_ALL_ACCESS` (0x00000010) - Specifies that the cache will provide no guarantees of access restriction.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_RUNTIME` (0x80000000) - Reserved for internal debugging.  \n  \n `pdwOutFlags`  \n [out] A flag for additional output information.
