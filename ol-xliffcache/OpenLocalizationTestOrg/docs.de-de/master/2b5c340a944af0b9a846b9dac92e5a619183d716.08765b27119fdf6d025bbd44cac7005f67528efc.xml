The following procedure shows how to print just the client area of a form, without the title bar, borders, and scroll bars.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n### To print the client area of a form  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.ClientAreaOnly)  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, use the compatible printing method: `PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption CompatibleModeClientAreaOnly).`  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.Print%2A>   \n [PrintForm Component](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/printform-component.md)   \n [How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-client-and-non-client-areas-of-a-form.md)   \n [How to: Print a Scrollable Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-a-scrollable-form.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,83],"content":"How to: Print the Client Area of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print the Client Area of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,71]}]},{"pos":[604,658],"content":"How to: Print the Client Area of a Form (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Print the Client Area of a Form (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print the Client Area of a Form (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[659,851],"source":"The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component."},{"content":"The following procedure shows how to print just the client area of a form, without the title bar, borders, and scroll bars.","pos":[852,975]},{"pos":[982,1162],"content":"The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Download Center<ept id=\"p1\">](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169)</ept>.","source":"The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169)."},{"pos":[1172,1206],"content":"To print the client area of a form","linkify":"To print the client area of a form","nodes":[{"content":"To print the client area of a form","pos":[0,34]}]},{"pos":[1216,1379],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Toolbox<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, click the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Visual Basic PowerPacks<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> tab and then drag the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component onto the form.","source":"In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component is added to the component tray.","pos":[1390,1494],"source":"The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray."},{"pos":[1504,1671],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window, set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction&gt;</ph>.","source":"In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>."},{"pos":[1681,1805],"content":"Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Click`</ph> event handler for a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Print<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept><ph id=\"ph2\">`Button`</ph>).","source":"Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`)."},{"pos":[1925,2202],"content":"[!NOTE]\nOn some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly.
