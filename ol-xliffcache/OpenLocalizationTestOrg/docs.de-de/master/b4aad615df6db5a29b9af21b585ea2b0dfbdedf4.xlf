        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The common language runtime is the foundation of the .NET Framework.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Think of the runtime as an agent that manages code at execution time, providing core services such as memory management, thread management, and remoting, while also enforcing strict type safety and other forms of code accuracy that promote security and robustness.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In fact, the concept of code management is a fundamental principle of the runtime.</source>

        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Code that targets the runtime is known as managed code, while code that doesn't target the runtime is known as unmanaged code.</source>

        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The class library is a comprehensive, object-oriented collection of reusable types that you use to develop apps ranging from traditional command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) apps to apps based on the latest innovations provided by ASP.NET, such as Web Forms and XML Web services.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The .NET Framework can be hosted by unmanaged components that load the common language runtime into their processes and initiate the execution of managed code, thereby creating a software environment that exploits both managed and unmanaged features.</source>

          <source>For example, ASP.NET hosts the runtime to provide a scalable, server-side environment for managed code.</source>

        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Features of the common language runtime</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The common language runtime manages memory, thread execution, code execution, code safety verification, compilation, and other system services.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These features are intrinsic to the managed code that runs on the common language runtime.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Regarding security, managed components are awarded varying degrees of trust, depending on a number of factors that include their origin (such as the Internet, enterprise network, or local computer).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means that a managed component might or might not be able to perform file-access operations, registry-access operations, or other sensitive functions, even if it's used in the same active app.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The runtime also enforces code robustness by implementing a strict type-and-code-verification infrastructure called the common type system (CTS).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The CTS ensures that all managed code is self-describing.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The various Microsoft and third-party language compilers generate managed code that conforms to the CTS.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This means that managed code can consume other managed types and instances, while strictly enforcing type fidelity and type safety.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In addition, the managed environment of the runtime eliminates many common software issues.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, the runtime automatically handles object layout and manages references to objects, releasing them when they are no longer being used.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This automatic memory management resolves the two most common app errors, memory leaks and invalid memory references.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The runtime also accelerates developer productivity.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, programmers write apps in their development language of choice yet take full advantage of the runtime, the class library, and components written in other languages by other developers.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Any compiler vendor who chooses to target the runtime can do so.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Language compilers that target the .NET Framework make the features of the .NET Framework available to existing code written in that language, greatly easing the migration process for existing apps.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While the runtime is designed for the software of the future, it also supports software of today and yesterday.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="146" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Interoperability between managed and unmanaged code enables developers to continue to use necessary COM components and DLLs.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="147" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The runtime is designed to enhance performance.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="148" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Although the common language runtime provides many standard runtime services, managed code is never interpreted.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="149" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A feature called just-in-time (JIT) compiling enables all managed code to run in the native machine language of the system on which it's executing.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="150" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Meanwhile, the memory manager removes the possibilities of fragmented memory and increases memory locality-of-reference to further increase performance.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="151" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Finally, the runtime can be hosted by high-performance, server-side apps, such as Microsoft SQL Server and Internet Information Services (IIS).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="152" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This infrastructure enables you to use managed code to write your business logic, while still enjoying the superior performance of the industry's best enterprise servers that support runtime hosting.</source>
