It's useful for fast iterative development from the command line. The command depends on the [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md) command to build the code. Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to `dotnet run` as well.\n\nOutput files are written into the default location, which is `bin/<configuration>/<target>`. For example if you have a `netcoreapp2.1` application and you run `dotnet run`, the output is placed in `bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1`. Files are overwritten as needed. Temporary files are placed in the `obj` directory.\n\nIf the project specifies multiple frameworks, executing `dotnet run` results in an error unless the `-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>` option is used to specify the framework.\n\nThe `dotnet run` command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you're trying to run a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use [dotnet](dotnet.md) without a command. For example, to run `myapp.dll`, use:\n\n```console\ndotnet myapp.dll\n```\n\nFor more information on the `dotnet` driver, see the [.NET Core Command Line Tools (CLI)](index.md) topic.\n\nTo run the application, the `dotnet run` command resolves the dependencies of the application that are outside of the shared runtime from the NuGet cache. Because it uses cached dependencies, it's not recommended to use `dotnet run` to run applications in production. Instead, [create a deployment](../deploying/index.md) using the [`dotnet publish`](dotnet-publish.md) command and deploy the published output.\n\n[!INCLUDE[dotnet restore note + options](~/includes/dotnet-restore-note-options.md)]\n\n## Options\n\n# [.NET Core 2.1](#tab/netcore21)\n\n`--`\n\nDelimits arguments to `dotnet run` from arguments for the application being run.

Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the *project.assets.json* file.\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`--launch-profile <NAME>`\n\nThe name of the launch profile (if any) to use when launching the application. Launch profiles are defined in the *launchSettings.json* file and are typically called `Development`,\n`Staging`, and `Production`. For more information, see [Working with multiple environments](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments).\n\n`--no-build`\n\nDoesn't build the project before running.

For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md).\n\n`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command.

Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the *project.assets.json* file.\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`--launch-profile <NAME>`\n\nThe name of the launch profile (if any) to use when launching the application.

example is passed to the application, since the blank `--` option is used):\n\n`dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help`\n\nRestore dependencies and tools for the project in the current directory only showing minimal output and then run the project:\n (.NET Core SDK 2.0 and later versions):\n\n`dotnet run --verbosity
