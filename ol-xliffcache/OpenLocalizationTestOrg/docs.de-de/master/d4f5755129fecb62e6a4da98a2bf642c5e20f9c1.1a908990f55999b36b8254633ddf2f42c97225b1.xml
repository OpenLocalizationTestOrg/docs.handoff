Each operation has an individual instance. That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract. The object instances are named using the following pattern:  \n  \n```  \n(ServiceName).(ContractName).(OperationName)@(first endpoint listener address)  \n```  \n  \n This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, WCF replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Performance Counters](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/performance-counters/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,114],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Operation Performance Counters\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 333a51e0-f56e-4e1a-b359-5c91ff390568","nodes":[{"content":"Operation Performance Counters","nodes":[{"pos":[0,30],"content":"Operation Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Operation Performance Counters","pos":[0,30]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[121,151],"content":"Operation Performance Counters","linkify":"Operation Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Operation Performance Counters","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Operation performance counters are found under the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0`</ph> performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe).","pos":[152,310],"source":"Operation performance counters are found under the `ServiceModelOperation 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor (Perfmon.exe)."},{"content":"Each operation has an individual instance.","pos":[311,353]},{"content":"That is, if a given contract has 10 operations, 10 operation counter instances are associated with that contract.","pos":[354,467]},{"content":"The object instances are named using the following pattern:","pos":[468,527]},{"content":"This counter enables you to measure how the call is being used and how well the operation is performing.","pos":[630,734]},{"pos":[742,987],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name.
