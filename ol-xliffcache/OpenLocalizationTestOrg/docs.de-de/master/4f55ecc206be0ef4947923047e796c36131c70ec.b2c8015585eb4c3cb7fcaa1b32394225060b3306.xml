Finally, use the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> properties to describe the polyline outline because a line without a stroke is invisible.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> element is not a closed shape, the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> property has no effect, even if you deliberately close the shape outline. To create a closed shape with a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A>, use a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon> element.  \n  \n The following example draws two <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> elements inside a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>.  \n  \n## Example  \n In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], valid syntax for points is a space-delimited list of comma-separated x- and y-coordinate pairs.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[drawingwithshapeelements#PolylineExample1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/polylineexample.xaml#polylineexample1)]  \n  \n Although this example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> to contain the polylines, you can use polyline elements (and all the other shape elements) with any <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> that supports non-text content.  \n  \n This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polygon>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape>\n- [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)\n- [Shapes and Basic Drawing in WPF Overview](shapes-and-basic-drawing-in-wpf-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,326],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"connected lines [WPF]\"\n  - \"polylines [WPF], drawing\"\n  - \"graphics [WPF], polylines\"\n  - \"lines [WPF], connected (see polylines)\"\n  - \"drawing [WPF], polylines\"\nms.assetid: 65db8935-d047-4295-87c4-b427ff3ad293","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[333,386],"content":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","linkify":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Polyline by Using the Polyline Element","pos":[0,53]}]},{"pos":[387,527],"content":"This example shows how to draw a polyline, which is a series of connected lines, by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline&gt;</ph> element.","source":"This example shows how to draw a polyline, which is a series of connected lines, by using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> element."},{"content":"To draw a polyline, create a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline&gt;</ph> element and use its <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline.Points%2A&gt;</ph> property to specify the shape vertices.","pos":[534,708],"source":"To draw a polyline, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> element and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline.Points%2A> property to specify the shape vertices."},{"content":"Finally, use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A&gt;</ph> properties to describe the polyline outline because a line without a stroke is invisible.","pos":[709,918],"source":" Finally, use the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> properties to describe the polyline outline because a line without a stroke is invisible."},{"pos":[926,1266],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Because the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Polyline> element is not a closed shape, the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> property has no effect, even if you deliberately close the shape outline.
