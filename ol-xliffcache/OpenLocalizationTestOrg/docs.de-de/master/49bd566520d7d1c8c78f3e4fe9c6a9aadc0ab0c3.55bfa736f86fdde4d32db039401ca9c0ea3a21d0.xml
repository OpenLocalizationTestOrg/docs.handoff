You can specify the following requirements in any combination:  \n  \n-   The type argument must implement one or more interfaces  \n  \n-   The type argument must inherit from at most one class  \n  \n-   The type argument must expose a parameterless constructor that the creating code can access (include the `New` constraint)  \n  \n If you do not include any specific class or interface in the constraint list, you can impose a more general requirement by specifying one of the following:  \n  \n-   The type argument must be a value type (include the `Structure` constraint)  \n  \n-   The type argument must be a reference type (include the `Class` constraint)  \n  \n You cannot specify both `Structure` and `Class` for the same type parameter, and you cannot specify either one more than once.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32107  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you want to allow the type argument to be any reference type, remove the class name from the constraint list.  \n  \n-   If you want the type argument to inherit from the specified class name, remove the `Class` keyword from the constraint list.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n- [Value Types and Reference Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/value-types-and-reference-types.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,235],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'Class' constraint and a specific class type constraint cannot be combined\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
