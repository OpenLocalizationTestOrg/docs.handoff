If you use a user-defined class or structure, you must define all the preceding operators on that class or structure.  \n  \n Note also that the data types of the `start`, `end`, and `step` expressions in the `For` statement must widen to the data type of the counter variable. If the counter variable is a user-defined class or structure and the `start`, `end`, or `step` expression is of a different type, you must define the `CType` conversion operator to accomplish the necessary conversion.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33038  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Make sure the spelling of the counter-variable data type is correct.  \n  \n2.  If you are using a user-defined class or structure for the counter variable, define all the required operators on that class or structure.  \n  \n3.  Depending on the data types of the `start`, `end`, and `step` expressions, you might have to define one or more `CType` conversion operators to convert them to the counter variable data type.  \n
