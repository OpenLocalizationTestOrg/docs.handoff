An implicitly typed local variable is strongly typed just as if you had declared the type yourself, but the compiler determines the type. The following two declarations of `i` are functionally equivalent:  \n  \n```  \nvar i = 10; // implicitly typed  \nint i = 10; //explicitly typed  \n```  \n  \n For more information, see [Implicitly Typed Local Variables](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables.md) and [Type Relationships in LINQ Query Operations](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows two query expressions. In the first expression, the use of `var` is permitted but is not required, because the type of the query result can be stated explicitly as an `IEnumerable<string>`. However, in the second expression, `var` must be used because the result is a collection of anonymous types, and the name of that type is not accessible except to the compiler itself. Note that in Example #2, the `foreach` iteration variable `item` must also be implicitly typed.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsTypes#18](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/var_1.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Implicitly Typed Local Variables](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/implicitly-typed-local-variables.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,556],"nodes":[{"content":"var (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"var (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"var (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]}],"pos":[6,44],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"var (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
