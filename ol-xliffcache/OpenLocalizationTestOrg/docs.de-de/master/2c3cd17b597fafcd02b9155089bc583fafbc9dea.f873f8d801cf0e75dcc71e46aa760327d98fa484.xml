To become active, a service must be hosted within a run-time environment that creates it and controls its context and lifetime. Hosting options range from running inside the simplest console application to server environments like a Windows service, Internet Information Services (IIS), or within a worker process managed by the Windows Activation Service (WAS). To review the different hosting options for your WCF application, see [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)\n- [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,102],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Deploying Services\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: ac361bfb-017d-4da9-a2d7-fc0fb72d65bb","nodes":[{"content":"Deploying Services","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"Deploying Services","nodes":[{"content":"Deploying Services","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[109,127],"content":"Deploying Services","linkify":"Deploying Services","nodes":[{"content":"Deploying Services","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This topic describes how you can deploy a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application to a run-time environment.","pos":[128,247]},{"pos":[256,309],"content":"Choosing the Hosting Environment for Your Application","linkify":"Choosing the Hosting Environment for Your Application","nodes":[{"content":"Choosing the Hosting Environment for Your Application","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"WCF services are designed to run in any Windows process that supports managed code.","pos":[313,396]},{"content":"To become active, a service must be hosted within a run-time environment that creates it and controls its context and lifetime.","pos":[397,524]},{"content":"Hosting options range from running inside the simplest console application to server environments like a Windows service, Internet Information Services (IIS), or within a worker process managed by the Windows Activation Service (WAS).","pos":[525,759]},{"content":"To review the different hosting options for your WCF application, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Hosting Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)</ept>.","pos":[760,901],"source":" To review the different hosting options for your WCF application, see [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)."},{"pos":[910,918],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[922,990],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Hosting<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)</ept>","source":"[Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)"},{"pos":[993,1063],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Hosting Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)"}]}
