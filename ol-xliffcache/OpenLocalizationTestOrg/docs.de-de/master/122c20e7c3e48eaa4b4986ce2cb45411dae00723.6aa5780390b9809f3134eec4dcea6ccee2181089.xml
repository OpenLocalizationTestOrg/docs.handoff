Controls added to a form or moved on a form can be automatically aligned to the rows and columns of the Windows Forms Designer's grid, or you can align controls by using the snaplines feature.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To snap all controls to the grid  \n  \n-   Select the **SnapToGrid** layout mode in the Windows Forms Designer **Options** dialog box.  \n  \n     For more information, see [General, Windows Forms Designer, Options Dialog Box](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/5aazxs78(v=vs.100)). All controls now align themselves along the points on the grid.  \n  \n     You can snap individual controls to the grid by locking them in place. However, while they are locked, they cannot be moved or resized. For more information about locking controls, see [How to: Lock Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-lock-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n### To align controls using snaplines  \n  \n-   Select the **SnapLines** layout mode in the Windows Forms Designer **Options** dialog box.  \n  \n     For more information, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md). You can now use snaplines to align and arrange controls on your form.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [General, Windows Forms Designer, Options Dialog Box](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/5aazxs78(v=vs.100))\n- [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)\n- [Windows Forms Controls](index.md)\n- [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)\n- [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)\n- [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)\n- [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)\n- [Windows Forms Controls by Function](windows-forms-controls-by-function.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,350],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"GridSize\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"snap to grid [Windows Forms], Windows Forms Designer\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, grid options in designer\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], aligning\"\nms.assetid: bb54bce5-880f-4a36-af68-8cf92058dc1c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"pos":[0,69],"content":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","pos":[0,69]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[357,426],"content":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Arrange Controls with Snaplines and the Grid in Windows Forms","pos":[0,69]}]},{"content":"Using the layout features of Visual Studio, you can precisely direct where controls are placed on a form.","pos":[427,532]},{"content":"Controls added to a form or moved on a form can be automatically aligned to the rows and columns of the Windows Forms Designer's grid, or you can align controls by using the snaplines feature.","pos":[533,725]},{"pos":[733,1078],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
