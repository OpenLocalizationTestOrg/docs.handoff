The AdventureWorks Sales Model that is used in these examples is built from the Contact, Address, Product, SalesOrderHeader, and SalesOrderDetail tables in the AdventureWorks sample database.  \n  \n The examples in this topic use the following `using`/`Imports` statements:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Examples#ImportsUsing](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Examples/CS/Program.cs#importsusing)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Examples#ImportsUsing](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Examples/VB/Module1.vb#importsusing)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `GroupBy` method to return `Address` objects that are grouped by postal code. The results are projected into an anonymous type.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Examples#GroupBySimple3_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Examples/CS/Program.cs#groupbysimple3_mq)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Examples#GroupBySimple3_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Examples/VB/Module1.vb#groupbysimple3_mq)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `GroupBy` method to return `Contact` objects that are grouped by the first letter of the contact's last name.
