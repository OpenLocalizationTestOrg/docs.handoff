          <source>Because XML data is commonly encoded in the standard text format defined in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>XML 1.0 specification<ept id="p1">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94838)</ept>, connected systems developers and architects are typically concerned about the wire footprint (or size) of messages sent across the network, and the text-based encoding of XML poses special challenges for the efficient transfer of binary data.</source>

        <trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To provide background information about the following information for WCF, this section highlights some general concerns and considerations for encodings, binary data, and streaming that generally apply to connected systems infrastructures.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Encoding Data: Text vs. Binary</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Commonly expressed developer concerns include the perception that XML has significant overhead when compared to binary formats due to the repetitive nature of start tags and end tags, that the encoding of numerical values is considered to be significantly larger because they are expressed in text values, and that binary data cannot be expressed efficiently because it must be specially encoded for embedding into a text format.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While many of these and similar concerns are valid, the actual difference between XML-text encoded messages in an XML Web services environment and binary-encoded messages in a legacy remote procedure call (RPC) environment is often much less significant than the initial consideration might suggest.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While XML-text encoded messages are transparent and "human readable", binary messages are often fairly obscure in comparison and difficult to decode without tools.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This difference in legibility leads one to overlook that binary messages also often carry inline metadata in the payload, which adds overhead just as with XML text messages.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is specifically true for binary formats that aim to provide loose-coupling and dynamic invocation capabilities.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, binary formats commonly carry such descriptive metadata information in a "header," which also declares the data layout for the following data records.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The payload then follows this common metadata block declaration with minimal further overhead.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In contrast, XML encloses each data item in an element or attribute so that the enclosing metadata is repetitively included for each serialized payload object.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As a result, the size of a single serialized payload object is similar when comparing text to binary representations as some descriptive metadata must be expressed for both, but the binary format benefits from the shared metadata description with each additional payload object that is transferred due to the lower overall overhead.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Still, for certain data types, such as numbers, there might be a disadvantage to using fixed-size, binary numerical representations, such as a 128-bit decimal type instead of plain text, as the plain text representation might be several bytes smaller.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Text data also might have size benefits from the typically more flexible XML text encoding choices, while some binary formats might default to 16-bit or even 32-bit Unicode, which does not apply to the .NET Binary XML Format.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As a result, deciding between text or binary is not quite as easy as assuming that binary messages are always smaller than XML-text messages.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A clear advantage of XML-text messages is that they are standards-based and offer the broadest choice of interoperability options and platform support.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

          <source>Binary Content</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One area where binary encodings are superior to text-based encodings in terms of the resulting message size are large binary data items such as pictures, videos, sound clips, or any other form of opaque, binary data that must be exchanged between services and their consumers.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To fit these types of data into XML text, the common approach is to encode them using the Base64 encoding.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In a Base64-encoded string, each character represents 6-bits of the original 8-bit data, which results in a 4:3 encoding-overhead ratio for Base64, not counting extra formatting characters (carriage return/line feed) that are commonly added by convention.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While the significance of the differences between XML and binary encodings typically depends on the scenario, a size gain of more than 33% when transmitting a 500-MB payload is usually not acceptable.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To avoid this encoding overhead, the Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) standard allows for externalizing large data elements that are contained in a message and carrying them with the message as binary data without any special encoding.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With MTOM, messages are exchanged in a similar fashion to Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email messages with attachments or embedded content (pictures and other embedded content); MTOM messages are packaged as multipart/related MIME sequences with the root part being the actual SOAP message.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>An MTOM SOAP message is modified from its un-encoded version so that special element tags that refer to the respective MIME parts take the place of the original elements in the message that contained binary data.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As a result, the SOAP message refers to binary content by pointing to the MIME parts sent with it, but otherwise just carries XML text data.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because this model is closely aligned with the well-established SMTP model, there is broad tooling support to encode and decode MTOM messages on many platforms, which makes it an extremely interoperable choice.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Still, as with Base64, MTOM also comes with some necessary overhead for the MIME format, so that advantages of using MTOM are only seen when the size of a binary data element exceeds about 1 KB.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Due to the overhead, MTOM-encoded messages might be larger than messages that use Base64 encoding for binary data, if the binary payload remains under that threshold.</source>

          <source>Wire-footprint aside, the previously mentioned 500-MB payload also poses a great local challenge at for the service and the client.</source>

        <trans-unit id="140" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The strategy to deal with large payloads is streaming.</source>

        <trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While messages, especially those expressed in XML, are commonly thought of as being relatively compact data packages, a message might be multiple gigabytes in size and resemble a continuous data stream more than a data package.</source>

        <trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When data is transferred in streaming mode instead of buffered mode, the sender makes the contents of the message body available to the recipient in the form of a stream and the message infrastructure continuously forwards the data from sender to receiver as it becomes available.</source>

        <trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The most common scenario in which such large data content transfers occur are transfers of binary data objects that:</source>

        <trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        <trans-unit id="147" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For data that does not have these constraints, it is typically better to send sequences of messages within the scope of a session than one large message.</source>
