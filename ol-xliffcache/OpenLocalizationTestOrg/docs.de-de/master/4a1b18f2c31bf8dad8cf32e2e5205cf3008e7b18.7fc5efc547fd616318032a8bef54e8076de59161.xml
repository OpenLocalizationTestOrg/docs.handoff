All other network-access classes in the <xref:System.Net> namespace are built on top of this implementation of sockets.  \n  \n The .NET Framework <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class is a managed-code version of the socket services provided by the Winsock32 API. In most cases, the **Socket** class methods simply marshal data into their native Win32 counterparts and handle any necessary security checks.  \n  \n The **Socket** class supports two basic modes, synchronous and asynchronous. In synchronous mode, calls to functions that perform network operations (such as <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Receive%2A>) wait until the operation completes before returning control to the calling program. In asynchronous mode, these calls return immediately.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Create a Socket](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-create-a-socket.md)\n\n- [Using Application Protocols](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-application-protocols.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,458],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Sockets\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application protocols, sockets\"\n  - \"sending data, sockets\"\n  - \"data requests, sockets\"\n  - \"Windows Sockets\"\n  - \"sockets, about sockets\"\n  - \"Socket class, about Socket class\"\n  - \"sockets\"\n  - \"requesting data from Internet, sockets\"\n  - \"network, sockets\"\n  - \"receiving data, sockets\"\n  - \"protocols, sockets\"\n  - \"Internet, sockets\"\nms.assetid: 10d22735-bd37-42c1-a2be-c1932f979a7d","nodes":[{"content":"Sockets","nodes":[{"pos":[0,7],"content":"Sockets","nodes":[{"content":"Sockets","pos":[0,7]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[465,472],"content":"Sockets","linkify":"Sockets","nodes":[{"content":"Sockets","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets&gt;</ph> namespace contains a managed implementation of the Windows Sockets interface.","pos":[473,580],"source":"The <xref:System.Net.Sockets> namespace contains a managed implementation of the Windows Sockets interface."},{"content":"All other network-access classes in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net&gt;</ph> namespace are built on top of this implementation of sockets.","pos":[581,700],"source":" All other network-access classes in the <xref:System.Net> namespace are built on top of this implementation of sockets."},{"content":"The .NET Framework <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket&gt;</ph> class is a managed-code version of the socket services provided by the Winsock32 API.","pos":[707,844],"source":"The .NET Framework <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class is a managed-code version of the socket services provided by the Winsock32 API."},{"content":"In most cases, the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class methods simply marshal data into their native Win32 counterparts and handle any necessary security checks.","pos":[845,987],"source":" In most cases, the **Socket** class methods simply marshal data into their native Win32 counterparts and handle any necessary security checks."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class supports two basic modes, synchronous and asynchronous.","pos":[994,1070],"source":"The **Socket** class supports two basic modes, synchronous and asynchronous."},{"content":"In synchronous mode, calls to functions that perform network operations (such as <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Send%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Receive%2A&gt;</ph>) wait until the operation completes before returning control to the calling program.","pos":[1071,1325],"source":" In synchronous mode, calls to functions that perform network operations (such as <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Send%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Receive%2A>) wait until the operation completes before returning control to the calling program."},{"content":"In asynchronous mode, these calls return immediately.","pos":[1326,1379]},{"pos":[1388,1396],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1400,1496],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Socket<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-create-a-socket.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Create a Socket](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-create-a-socket.md)"},{"pos":[1500,1605],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Protocols<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-application-protocols.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Application Protocols](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-application-protocols.md)"}]}
