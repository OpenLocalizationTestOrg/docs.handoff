This parameter must be 0.\n\n`ppNewClass`  \n[out] Receives the pointer to the new class definition object. If an error occurs, a new object is not returned, and `ppNewClass` is left unmodified. Its value cannot be `null`.\n\n## Return value\n\nThe following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:\n\n|Constant  |Value  |Description  |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |\n| `WBEM_E_INVALID_OPERATION` | 0x80041016 | An invalid operation, such as spawning a class from an instance, was requested. |\n| `WBEM_E_INCOMPLETE_CLASS` | The source class was not completely defined or registered with Windows Management, so a new derived class is not permitted. |\n| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to complete the operation. |\n| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | `ppNewClass` is `null`. |\n| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |\n  \n## Remarks\n\nThis function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::SpawnDerivedClass](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-clone) method.\n\n`ptr` must be a class definition that becomes the parent class of the spawned object. The returned object becomes a subclass of the current object.\n\nThe new object returned in `ppNewClass` automatically becomes a subclass of the current object. This behavior cannot be overridden. There is no other method by which subclasses (derived classes) can be created.\n\n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** WMINet_Utils.idl  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:**
