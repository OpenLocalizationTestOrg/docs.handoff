This topic provides a script written in HTML and JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../install/guide-for-developers.md).\n\n## Example\n\nWhen the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the client computer is configured with a WPF plug-in for Firefox. The following example script checks for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and then displays an appropriate status message.\n\n```html\n<HTML>\n\n  <HEAD>\n    <TITLE>Test for the WPF plug-in for Firefox</TITLE>\n    <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />\n    <SCRIPT type=\"text/javascript\">\n    <!--\n    function OnLoad()\n    {\n\n       // Check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and report\n       var msg = \"The WPF plug-in for Firefox is \";\n       var wpfPlugin = navigator.plugins[\"Windows Presentation Foundation\"];\n       if( wpfPlugin != null ) {\n          document.writeln(msg + \" installed.\");\n       }\n       else {\n          document.writeln(msg + \" not installed. Please install or reinstall the .NET Framework 3.5.\");\n       }\n    }\n    -->\n    </SCRIPT>\n  </HEAD>\n\n  <BODY onload=\"OnLoad()\" />\n\n</HTML>\n```\n\nIf the check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox is successful, the following status message is displayed:\n\n`The WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.`\n\nOtherwise, the following status message is displayed:\n\n`The WPF plug-in for Firefox is not installed. Please install or reinstall the .NET Framework 3.5.`\n\n## See also\n\n- [Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md)\n- [Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.5 Is Installed](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-5-is-installed.md)\n- [WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,403],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"plug-in for Firefox [WPF]\"\n  - \"detecting Firefox installation [WPF]\"\n  - \"checking for the Firefox plug-in [WPF]\"\n  - \"Firefox [WPF], detecting installation\"\n  - \"detecting whether the WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: 5f839373-e3fb-44f1-88ad-4a0761f02189","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","nodes":[{"pos":[0,63],"content":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","pos":[0,63]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[411,474],"content":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","linkify":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Detect Whether the WPF Plug-In for Firefox Is Installed","pos":[0,63]}]},{"content":"The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) plug-in for Firefox enables <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)]</ph> and loose XAML files to run in the Mozilla Firefox browser.","pos":[476,693],"source":"The Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) plug-in for Firefox enables [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] and loose XAML files to run in the Mozilla Firefox browser."},{"content":"This topic provides a script written in HTML and JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.","pos":[694,844]},{"pos":[848,1078],"content":"[!NOTE]\nFor more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../install/guide-for-developers.md).","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"For more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph>, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Install the .NET Framework for developers<ept id=\"p1\">](../../install/guide-for-developers.md)</ept>.","pos":[8,228],"source":"For more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../install/guide-for-developers.md)."}]},{"pos":[1083,1090],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"When the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)]</ph> is installed, the client computer is configured with a WPF plug-in for Firefox.","pos":[1092,1248],"source":"When the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the client computer is configured with a WPF plug-in for Firefox."},{"content":"The following example script checks for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and then displays an appropriate status message.","pos":[1249,1365]},{"content":"If the check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox is successful, the following status message is displayed:","pos":[2085,2187]},{"content":"Otherwise, the following status message is displayed:","pos":[2234,2287]},{"pos":[2393,2401],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2405,2518],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md)</ept>","source":"[Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md)"},{"pos":[2521,2634],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.5 Is Installed<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-5-is-installed.md)</ept>","source":"[Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.5 Is Installed](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-5-is-installed.md)"},{"pos":[2637,2720],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)"}]}
