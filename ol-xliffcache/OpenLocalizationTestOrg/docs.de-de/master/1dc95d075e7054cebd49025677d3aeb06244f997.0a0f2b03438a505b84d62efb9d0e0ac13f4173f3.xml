A *control* is a component on a form used to display information or accept user input. For more information about controls, see [Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To draw a control on a form  \n  \n1.  Open the form. For more information, see [How to: Display Windows Forms in the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bf3f1e5b-ea07-4529-85c6-6af3ded0cec5).  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, click the control you want to add to your form.  \n  \n3.  On the form, click where you want the upper-left corner of the control to be located, and drag to where you want the lower-right corner of the control to be located.  \n  \n     The control is added to the form with the specified location and size.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Each control has a default size defined. You can add a control to your form in the control's default size by dragging it from the **Toolbox** to the form.  \n  \n### To drag a control to a form  \n  \n1.  Open the form. For more information, see [How to: Display Windows Forms in the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bf3f1e5b-ea07-4529-85c6-6af3ded0cec5).  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, click the control you want and drag it to your form.  \n  \n     The control is added to the form at the specified location in its default size.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can double-click a control in the **Toolbox** to add it to the upper-left corner of the form in its default size.  \n  \n     You can also add controls dynamically to a form at run time. In the following code example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control will be added to the form when a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is clicked.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The following procedure requires the existence of a form with a **Button** control, `Button1`, already placed on it.  \n  \n### To add a control to a form programmatically  \n  \n1.  In the method that handles the button's `Click` event within your form's class, insert code similar to the following to add a reference to your control variable, set the control's `Location`, and add the control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n       Dim MyText As New TextBox()  \n       MyText.Location = New Point(25, 25)  \n       Me.Controls.Add(MyText)  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)   \n    {  \n       TextBox myText = new TextBox();  \n       myText.Location = new Point(25,25);  \n       this.Controls.Add (myText);  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n      System::Void button1_Click(System::Object ^  sender,  \n        System::EventArgs ^  e)  \n      {  \n        TextBox ^ myText = gcnew TextBox();  \n        myText->Location = Point(25,25);  \n        this->Controls->Add(myText);  \n      }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can also add code to initialize other properties of the control.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  You might expose your local computer to a security risk through the network by referencing a malicious `UserControl`. This would only be a concern in the case of a malicious person creating a damaging custom control, followed by you mistakenly adding it to your project.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md)   \n [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Resize Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-resize-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)   \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":"How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[510,547],"content":"How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"Most forms are designed by adding controls to the surface of the form to define a user interface (UI).","pos":[548,650]},{"content":"A <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>control<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> is a component on a form used to display information or accept user input.","pos":[651,737],"source":" A *control* is a component on a form used to display information or accept user input."},{"content":"For more information about controls, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Windows Forms Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md)</ept>.","pos":[738,859],"source":" For more information about controls, see [Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md)."},{"pos":[867,1243],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
