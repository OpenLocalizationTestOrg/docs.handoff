It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, suppose you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to use it with the [/ Operator (Visual Basic)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/floating-point-division-operator.md). If you do this, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a numeric value.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
