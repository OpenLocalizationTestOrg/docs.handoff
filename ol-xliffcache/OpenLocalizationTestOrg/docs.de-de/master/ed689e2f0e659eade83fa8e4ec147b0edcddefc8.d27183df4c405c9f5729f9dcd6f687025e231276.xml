It is common to start with some form of XML, project intermediate results as collections of anonymous types or named types, and then finally to project the results back into XML that is in an entirely different shape than the source XML.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example processes a WordprocessingML document, retrieving the paragraph nodes from a WordprocessingML document. It also identifies the style and text of each paragraph. Finally, the example projects XML with a different shape. This example builds on the previous examples in this tutorial. The new statement that does the projection is called out in comments in the code below.  \n  \n For instructions for creating the source document for this example, see [Creating the Source Office Open XML Document (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-the-source-office-open-xml-document.md).  \n  \n This example uses classes from the WindowsBase assembly. It uses types in the <xref:System.IO.Packaging?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports <xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\">  \n  \nModule Module1  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As String In source  \n            sb.Append(s)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item))  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As T In source  \n            sb.Append(s).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String), ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item)).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Public Function ParagraphText(ByVal e As XElement) As String  \n        Dim w As XNamespace = e.Name.Namespace  \n        Return (e.<w:r>.<w:t>).StringConcatenate(Function(element) CStr(element))  \n    End Function  \n  \n    ' Following function is required because VB does not support short circuit evaluation  \n    Private Function GetStyleOfParagraph(ByVal styleNode As XElement, _  \n                                         ByVal defaultStyle As String) As String  \n        If (styleNode Is Nothing) Then  \n            Return defaultStyle  \n        Else  \n            Return styleNode.@w:val  \n        End If  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim fileName = \"SampleDoc.docx\"  \n  \n        Dim documentRelationshipType = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/officeDocument\"  \n        Dim stylesRelationshipType = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/styles\"  \n        Dim wordmlNamespace = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\"  \n        Dim xDoc As XDocument = Nothing  \n        Dim styleDoc As XDocument = Nothing  \n  \n        Using wdPackage As Package = Package.Open(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)  \n            Dim docPackageRelationship As PackageRelationship = _  \n              wdPackage.GetRelationshipsByType(documentRelationshipType).FirstOrDefault()  \n            If (docPackageRelationship IsNot Nothing) Then  \n                Dim documentUri As Uri = PackUriHelper.ResolvePartUri(New Uri(\"/\", UriKind.Relative), _  \n                  docPackageRelationship.TargetUri)  \n                Dim documentPart As PackagePart = wdPackage.GetPart(documentUri)  \n  \n                '  Load the document XML in the part into an XDocument instance.  \n                xDoc = XDocument.Load(XmlReader.Create(documentPart.GetStream()))  \n  \n                '  Find the styles part.
