By using reflection, you can retrieve the information that was defined with custom attributes. The key method is `GetCustomAttributes`, which returns an array of objects that are the run-time equivalents of the source code attributes. This method has several overloaded versions. For more information, see <xref:System.Attribute>.  \n  \n An attribute specification such as:  \n  \n```csharp  \n[Author(\"P. Ackerman\", version = 1.1)]  \nclass SampleClass  \n```  \n  \n is conceptually equivalent to this:  \n  \n```csharp  \nAuthor anonymousAuthorObject = new Author(\"P. Ackerman\");  \nanonymousAuthorObject.version = 1.1;  \n```  \n  \n However, the code is not executed until `SampleClass` is queried for attributes. Calling `GetCustomAttributes` on `SampleClass` causes an `Author` object to be constructed and initialized as above. If the class has other attributes, other attribute objects are constructed similarly. `GetCustomAttributes` then returns the `Author` object and any other attribute objects in an array. You can then iterate over this array, determine what attributes were applied based on the type of each array element, and extract information from the attribute objects.  \n  \n## Example  \n Here is a complete example. A custom attribute is defined, applied to several entities, and retrieved via reflection.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Multiuse attribute.  \n[System.AttributeUsage(System.AttributeTargets.Class |  \n                       System.AttributeTargets.Struct,  \n                       AllowMultiple = true)  // Multiuse attribute.  \n]  \npublic class Author : System.Attribute  \n{  \n    string name;  \n    public double version;  \n  \n    public Author(string name)  \n    {  \n        this.name = name;  \n  \n        // Default value.  \n        version = 1.0;  \n    }  \n  \n    public string GetName()  \n    {  \n        return name;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n// Class with the Author attribute.  \n[Author(\"P. Ackerman\")]  \npublic class FirstClass  \n{  \n    // ...  \n}  \n  \n// Class without the Author attribute.  \npublic class SecondClass  \n{  \n    // ...  \n}  \n  \n// Class with multiple Author attributes.  \n[Author(\"P. Ackerman\"), Author(\"R. Koch\", version = 2.0)]  \npublic class ThirdClass  \n{  \n    // ...  \n}  \n  \nclass TestAuthorAttribute  \n{  \n    static void Test()  \n    {  \n        PrintAuthorInfo(typeof(FirstClass));  \n        PrintAuthorInfo(typeof(SecondClass));  \n        PrintAuthorInfo(typeof(ThirdClass));  \n    }  \n  \n    private static void PrintAuthorInfo(System.Type t)  \n    {  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"Author information for {0}\", t);  \n  \n        // Using reflection.  \n        System.Attribute[] attrs = System.Attribute.GetCustomAttributes(t);  // Reflection.  \n  \n        // Displaying output.  \n        foreach (System.Attribute attr in attrs)  \n        {  \n            if (attr is Author)  \n            {  \n                Author a = (Author)attr;  \n                System.Console.WriteLine(\"   {0}, version {1:f}\", a.GetName(), a.version);  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n/* Output:  \n    Author information for FirstClass  \n       P. Ackerman, version 1.00  \n    Author information for SecondClass  \n    Author information for ThirdClass  \n       R. Koch, version 2.00  \n       P.
