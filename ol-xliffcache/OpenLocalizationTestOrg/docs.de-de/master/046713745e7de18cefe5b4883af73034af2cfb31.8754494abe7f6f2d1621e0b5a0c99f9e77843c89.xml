Each node in the tree view might contain other nodes, called *child nodes*. You can display parent nodes, or nodes that contain child nodes, as expanded or collapsed. You can also display a tree view with check boxes next to the nodes by setting the tree view's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.CheckBoxes%2A> property to `true`. You can then programmatically select or clear nodes by setting the node's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Checked%2A> property to `true` or `false`.\n\n## Key Properties\n\nThe key properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.SelectedNode%2A>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property contains the list of top-level nodes in the tree view. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.SelectedNode%2A> property sets the currently selected node. You can display icons next to the nodes. The control uses images from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList> named in the tree view's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.ImageList%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.ImageIndex%2A> property sets the default image for nodes in the tree view. For more information about displaying images, see [How to: Set Icons for the Windows Forms TreeView Control](how-to-set-icons-for-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md). If you are using Visual Studio 2005, you have access to a large library of standard images that you can use with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control.\n\n## See also\n\n-
