Use query syntax.\n\n2. Use method syntax.\n\n3. Use a combination of query syntax and method syntax.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate some simple LINQ queries by using each approach listed previously. In general, the rule is to use (1) whenever possible, and use (2) and (3) whenever necessary.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> These queries operate on simple in-memory collections; however, the basic syntax is identical to that used in LINQ to Entities and LINQ to XML.\n\n## Example - Query syntax\n\nThe recommended way to write most queries is to use *query syntax* to create *query expressions*. The following example shows three query expressions. The first query expression demonstrates how to filter or restrict results by applying conditions with a `where` clause. It returns all elements in the source sequence whose values are greater than 7 or less than 3. The second expression demonstrates how to order the returned results. The third expression demonstrates how to group results according to a key. This query returns two groups based on the first letter of the word.\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-write-linq-queries_1.cs)]\n\nNote that the type of the queries is <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601>. All of these queries could be written using `var` as shown in the following example:\n\n`var query = from num in numbers...`\n\nIn each previous example, the queries do not actually execute until you iterate over the query variable in a `foreach` statement or other statement. For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).\n\n## Example - Method syntax\n\nSome query operations must be expressed as a method call. The most common such methods are those that return singleton numeric values, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Max%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Min%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Average%2A>, and so on. These methods must always be called last in any query because they represent only a single value and cannot serve as the source for an additional query operation. The following example shows a method call in a query expression:\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-write-linq-queries_2.cs)]\n\nIf the method has Action or Func parameters, these are provided in the form of a [lambda](../programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md) expression, as shown in the following example:\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-write-linq-queries_3.cs)]\n\nIn the previous queries, only Query #4 executes immediately. This is because it returns a single value, and not a generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> collection. The method itself has to use `foreach` in order to compute its value.\n\nEach of the previous queries can be written by using implicit typing with [var](../language-reference/keywords/var.md), as shown in the following example:\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-write-linq-queries_4.cs)]\n\n## Example - Mixed query and method syntax\n\nThis example shows how to use method syntax on the results of a query clause. Just enclose the query expression in parentheses, and then apply the dot operator and call the method. In the following example, query #7 returns a count of the numbers whose value is between 3 and 7. In general, however, it is better to use a second variable to store the result of the method call. In this manner, the query is less likely to be confused with the results of the query.\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-write-linq-queries_5.cs)]\n\nBecause Query #7 returns a single value and not a collection, the query executes immediately.\n\nThe previous query can be written by using implicit typing with `var`, as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvar numCount = (from num in numbers...\n```\n\nIt can be written in method syntax as follows:\n\n```csharp\nvar numCount = numbers.Where(n => n < 3 || n > 7).Count();\n```\n\nIt can be written by using explicit typing, as follows:\n\n```csharp\nint numCount = numbers.Where(n => n < 3 || n > 7).Count();\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in C#](../programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)\n- [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)\n- [where clause](../language-reference/keywords/where-clause.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,156],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Write LINQ queries in C#\ndescription: Learn how to write LINQ queries in C#.\nms.date: 12/01/2016\nms.assetid: 30703f79-cf3a-4d02-b892-c95d58a1d9ed","nodes":[{"content":"Write LINQ queries in C#","nodes":[{"pos":[0,24],"content":"Write LINQ queries in C#","nodes":[{"content":"Write LINQ queries in C#","pos":[0,24]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"Learn how to write LINQ queries in C#.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Learn how to write LINQ queries in C#.","nodes":[{"content":"Learn how to write LINQ queries in C#.","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[163,188],"content":"Write LINQ queries in C\\#","linkify":"Write LINQ queries in C\\#","nodes":[{"content":"Write LINQ queries in C<ph id=\"ph1\">\\#</ph>","pos":[0,25],"source":"Write LINQ queries in C\\#"}]},{"content":"This article shows the three ways in which you can write a LINQ query in C#:","pos":[190,266]},{"content":"Use query syntax.","pos":[271,288]},{"content":"Use method syntax.","pos":[293,311]},{"content":"Use a combination of query syntax and method syntax.","pos":[316,368]},{"content":"The following examples demonstrate some simple LINQ queries by using each approach listed previously.","pos":[370,471]},{"content":"In general, the rule is to use (1) whenever possible, and use (2) and (3) whenever necessary.","pos":[472,565]},{"pos":[569,722],"content":"[!NOTE]\nThese queries operate on simple in-memory collections; however, the basic syntax is identical to that used in LINQ to Entities and LINQ to XML.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"These queries operate on simple in-memory collections; however, the basic syntax is identical to that used in LINQ to Entities and LINQ to XML.","pos":[8,151]}]},{"pos":[727,749],"content":"Example -
