This allows you to call into MSMQ receiver applications from [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] clients as well as call into [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services from MSMQ sender applications.  \n  \n In this section, we explain how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding> for queued communication between (1) a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client and an MSMQ application service written using System.Messaging and (2) an MSMQ application client and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n For a complete sample that demonstrates how to call a MSMQ receiver application from a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, see the [Windows Communication Foundation to Message Queuing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-to-message-queuing.md) sample.  \n  \n For a complete sample that demonstrates how to call a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service from a MSMQ client, see the [Message Queuing to Windows Communication Foundation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-queuing-to-wcf.md) sample.  \n  \n### To create a WCF service that receives messages from a MSMQ client  \n  \n1.  Define an interface that defines the service contract for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that receives queued messages from a MSMQ sender application, as shown in the following example code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_MsmqToWcf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/cs/service.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[S_MsmqToWcf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/vb/service.vb#1)]  \n  \n2.  Implement the interface and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehaviorAttribute> attribute to the class, as shown in the following example code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_MsmqToWcf#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/cs/service.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[S_MsmqToWcf#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmqtowcf/vb/service.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  Create a configuration file that specifies the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding>.  \n  \n  \n  \n4.  Instantiate a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object that uses the configured binding.  \n  \n  \n  \n### To create a WCF client that sends messages to a MSMQ receiver application  \n  \n1.  Define an interface that defines the service contract for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client that sends queued messages to the MSMQ receiver, as shown in the following example code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/proxy.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/proxy.vb#6)]  \n  \n2.  Define a client class that the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client uses to call the MSMQ receiver.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/snippets.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/snippets.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  Create a configuration that specifies use of the MsmqIntegrationBinding binding.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_WcfToMsmq#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/cs/snippets.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[S_WcfToMsmq#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_wcftomsmq/vb/snippets.vb#3)]  \n  \n4.
