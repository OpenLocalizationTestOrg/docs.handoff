To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections. Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)  \n Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in SQL Server.  \n  \n [OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)  \n Describes connection pooling for the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md)\n- [ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,102],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Connection Pooling\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 955c057f-aea8-4ba8-aa6d-e3dfa18ba8d5","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Pooling","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"Connection Pooling","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Pooling","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[109,127],"content":"Connection Pooling","linkify":"Connection Pooling","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Pooling","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"Connecting to a data source can be time consuming.","pos":[128,178]},{"content":"To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>connection pooling<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections.","pos":[179,363],"source":" To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections."},{"content":"Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.","pos":[364,444]},{"pos":[453,468],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)</ept>","pos":[472,586],"source":"[SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)"},{"content":"Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in SQL Server.","pos":[590,690]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)</ept>","pos":[697,827],"source":"[OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)"},{"content":"Describes connection pooling for the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.","pos":[831,1000]},{"pos":[1009,1017],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1021,1136],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md)</ept>","source":"[Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md)"},{"pos":[1139,1243],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)</ept>","source":"[ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)"}]}
