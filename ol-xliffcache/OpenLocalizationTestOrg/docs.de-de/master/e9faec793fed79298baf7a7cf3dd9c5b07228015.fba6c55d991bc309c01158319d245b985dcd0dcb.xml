In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md), you implemented a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service. This topic describes how to verify the discovery proxy, the service, and the client application work as expected.  \n  \n### Run the Discovery Proxy  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  \n  \n2.  You may see a dialog that says: Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program. If you see this message, click the **Unblock** button.  \n  \n3.  Within the command prompt, run the discovery proxy, DiscoveryProxy.exe.  \n  \n4.  The application should display the following text: `Proxy started. Hit Enter to exit`.  \n  \n### Run the Discoverable Service  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.  \n  \n2.  Within the command prompt, run the Service.exe discoverable service.  \n  \n3.  The DiscoveryProxy.exe should display the following text: `******* Adding the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 3.******* Done *******` .  \n  \n### Run the Client Application  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt.  \n  \n2.  Within the command prompt, run the client.exe application.  \n  \n3.  After a few seconds the client application displays the following text: Connecting to [Service-Endpoint].  \n  \n4.  The service.exe should then display the following text: Greeting request received, I will respond.  \n  \n5.  The client.exe should then display the following text: Hello Client!  \n  \n### Shut Down the Applications  \n  \n1.  Shut down the client application.  \n  \n2.  Shut down the service. The discovery proxy displays the following text: `******* Removing the following service: ** [Service Contract Name] ** [Service Endpoint Addr] 2.3.******* Done *******`.  \n  \n3.  Shut down the discovery proxy.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WCF Discovery Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-discovery-overview.md)   \n [How to: Implement a Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-implement-a-discovery-proxy.md)   \n [How to: Implement a Discoverable Service that Registers with the Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/discoverable-service-that-registers-with-the-discovery-proxy.md)   \n [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[359,391],"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","linkify":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test the Discovery Proxy","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"This is the fourth of four topics that shows how to implement a discovery proxy.","pos":[392,472]},{"content":"In the previous topic, <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md)</ept>, you implemented a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service.","pos":[473,850],"source":" In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Client Application that Uses the Discovery Proxy to Find a Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/client-app-discovery-proxy-to-find-a-service.md), you implemented a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client application that uses the discovery proxy to find a service and then calls the service."},{"content":"This topic describes how to verify the discovery proxy, the service, and the client application work as expected.","pos":[851,964]},{"pos":[974,997],"content":"Run the Discovery Proxy","linkify":"Run the Discovery Proxy","nodes":[{"content":"Run the Discovery Proxy","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Open a command prompt as an administrator.","pos":[1007,1049]},{"content":"You may see a dialog that says: Windows Firewall has blocked some features of this program.","pos":[1059,1150]},{"content":"If you see this message, click the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Unblock<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> button.","pos":[1151,1205],"source":" If you see this message, click the **Unblock** button."},{"content":"Within the command prompt, run the discovery proxy, DiscoveryProxy.exe.","pos":[1215,1286]},{"pos":[1296,1382],"content":"The application should display the following text: <ph id=\"ph1\">`Proxy started.
