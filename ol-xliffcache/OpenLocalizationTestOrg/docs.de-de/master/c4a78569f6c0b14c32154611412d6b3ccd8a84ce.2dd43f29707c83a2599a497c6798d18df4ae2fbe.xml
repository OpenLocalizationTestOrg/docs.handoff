[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] supports several line caps, such as round, square, diamond, and arrowhead.  \n  \n## Example  \n You can specify line caps for the start of a line (start cap), the end of a line (end cap), or the dashes of a dashed line (dash cap).  \n  \n The following example draws a line with an arrowhead at one end and a round cap at the other end. The illustration shows the resulting line:  \n  \n ![Illustration that shows a line with a round cap.](./media/how-to-draw-a-line-with-line-caps/line-cap-arrowhead-example.gif)  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#71](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#71)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#71](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#71)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n  \n-   Create a Windows Form and handle the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event.
