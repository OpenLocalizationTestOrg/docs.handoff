It can find an extension method with that name, but not with a signature that matches the types you passed in with your method call.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Pass in types that match an existing extension method or class method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code generates CS1928:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs1928.cs  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n        Test t = new Test();  \n        t.M(\"hi\"); // CS1928  \n    }  \n}  \nstatic class Ext  \n{  \n    public static void M(this Test t, int i)  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This error is often accompanied by CS1503: Argument 'n': cannot convert from 'typeA' to 'typeB'.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Extension Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1928\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1928\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1928\"\nms.assetid: bcc9dbef-ded5-4ddd-8c03-a9837cb6d165","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1928","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'Type' does not contain a definition for 'method' and the best extension method overload 'method' has some invalid arguments.","pos":[194,319]},{"content":"This error is produced when the compiler cannot find a class member with the name of the method you have called.","pos":[326,438]},{"content":"It can find an extension method with that name, but not with a signature that matches the types you passed in with your method call.","pos":[439,571]},{"pos":[580,601],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Pass in types that match an existing extension method or class method.","pos":[611,681]},{"pos":[690,697],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code generates CS1928:","pos":[701,737]},{"content":"This error is often accompanied by CS1503: Argument 'n': cannot convert from 'typeA' to 'typeB'.","pos":[994,1090]},{"pos":[1099,1107],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1111,1203],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Extension Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Extension Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)"}]}
