When the mouse pointer is over the bar, the pointer changes shape to show that the bar is movable.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the **Toolbox**, this control replaces the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Splitter> control that was there in the previous version of Visual Studio. The `SplitContainer` control is much preferred over the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Splitter> control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Splitter> class is still included in the .NET Framework for compatibility with existing applications, but we strongly encourage you to use the `SplitContainer` control for new projects.  \n  \n The `SplitContainer` control lets you create complex user interfaces; often, a selection in one panel determines what objects are shown in the other panel. This arrangement is very effective for displaying and browsing information. Having two panels allow you to aggregate information in areas, and the bar, or \"splitter,\" makes it easy for users to resize the panels.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SplitContainer Control Overview](splitcontainer-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the `SplitContainer` control and describes the commonly used properties, methods, and events.  \n  \n [How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window](how-to-define-resize-and-positioning-behavior-in-a-split-window.md)  \n Describes how to control the splitter within the `SplitContainer` control.  \n  \n [How to: Split a Window Horizontally](how-to-split-a-window-horizontally.md)  \n Describes how to control the orientation of the splitter within the `SplitContainer` control.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Multipane User Interface with Windows Forms](how-to-create-a-multipane-user-interface-with-windows-forms.md)  \n Creates a multi-pane user interface that is similar to the one used in Microsoft Outlook.  \n  \n Also see [How to: Split a Window Horizontally Using the Designer](how-to-split-a-window-horizontally-using-the-designer.md), [How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form](how-to-create-a-windows-explorer-style-interface-on-a-windows-form.md), [How to: Create a Multipane User Interface with Windows Forms Using the Designer](create-a-multipane-user-interface-with-wf-using-the-designer.md).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> class  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Windows Forms Controls](index.md)  \n Provides links to topics about the controls designed specifically to work with Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,212],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"splitter windows\"\n  - \"SplitContainer control [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 2e36f17f-5c39-4fb4-bb09-7ce3ef823402","nodes":[{"content":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[219,257],"content":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"SplitContainer Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`SplitContainer`</ph> control can be thought of as a composite; it is two panels separated by a movable bar.","pos":[258,379],"source":"The Windows Forms `SplitContainer` control can be thought of as a composite; it is two panels separated by a movable bar."},{"content":"When the mouse pointer is over the bar, the pointer changes shape to show that the bar is movable.","pos":[380,478]},{"pos":[486,963],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In the **Toolbox**, this control replaces the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Splitter> control that was there in the previous version of Visual Studio.
