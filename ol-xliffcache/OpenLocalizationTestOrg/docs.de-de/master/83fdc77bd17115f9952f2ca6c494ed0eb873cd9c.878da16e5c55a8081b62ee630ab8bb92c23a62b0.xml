This topic describes both approaches.  \n  \n When using a configuration file, behavior configuration is a named collection of configuration settings. The name of each behavior configuration must be unique. This string is used in the `behaviorConfiguration` attribute of an endpoint configuration to link the endpoint to the behavior.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following configuration code defines a behavior called `myBehavior`. The client endpoint references this behavior in the `behaviorConfiguration` attribute.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n    <system.serviceModel>  \n        <behaviors>  \n            <endpointBehaviors>  \n                <behavior name=\"myBehavior\">  \n                    <clientVia />  \n                </behavior>  \n            </endpointBehaviors>  \n        </behaviors>  \n        <bindings>  \n            <basicHttpBinding>  \n                <binding name=\"myBinding\" maxReceivedMessageSize=\"10000\" />  \n            </basicHttpBinding>  \n        </bindings>  \n        <client>  \n            <endpoint address=\"myAddress\" binding=\"basicHttpBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"myBinding\" behaviorConfiguration=\"myBehavior\" contract=\"myContract\" />  \n        </client>  \n    </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## Using Behaviors Programmatically  \n You can also configure or insert behaviors programmatically by locating the appropriate `Behaviors` property on the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client object or on the client channel factory object prior to opening the client.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows how to programmatically insert a behavior by accessing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint.Behaviors%2A> property on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> returned from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory.Endpoint%2A> property prior to the creation of the channel object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ChannelFactoryBehaviors#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/channelfactorybehaviors/cs/client.cs#10)]\n [!code-vb[ChannelFactoryBehaviors#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/channelfactorybehaviors/vb/client.vb#10)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [\\<behaviors>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/behaviors.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,146],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Configuring Client Behaviors\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
