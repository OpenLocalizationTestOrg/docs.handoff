Additionally, because this requires the Kerberos protocol, this scenario requires a Windows domain environment.  \n  \n ![Message security without credential negotiation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/0c9f9baa-2439-4ef9-92f4-43c242d85d0d.gif \"0c9f9baa-2439-4ef9-92f4-43c242d85d0d\")  \n  \n|Characteristic|Description|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|Security Mode|Message|  \n|Interoperability|Yes, WS-Security with Kerberos token-profile compatible clients|  \n|Authentication (Server)|Mutual authentication of the server and client|  \n|Authentication (Client)|Mutual authentication of the server and client|  \n|Integrity|Yes|  \n|Confidentiality|Yes|  \n|Transport|HTTP|  \n|Binding|<xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>|  \n  \n## Service  \n The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:  \n  \n-   Create a stand-alone service using the code with no configuration.  \n  \n-   Create a service using the supplied configuration, but do not define any endpoints.  \n  \n### Code  \n The following code creates a service endpoint that uses message security. The code disables service credential negotiation, and the establishment of a security context token (SCT).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To use the Windows credential type without negotiation, the service's user account must have access to service principal name (SPN) that is registered with the Active Directory domain. You can do this in two ways:  \n  \n1.  Use the `NetworkService` or `LocalSystem` account to run your service. Because those accounts have access to the machine SPN that is established when the machine joins the Active Directory domain, WCF automatically generates the proper SPN element inside the service's endpoint in the service's metadata (Web Services Description Language, or WSDL).  \n  \n2.  Use an arbitrary Active Directory domain account to run your service. In this case, you need to establish an SPN for that domain account. One way of doing this is to use the Setspn.exe utility tool. Once the SPN is created for the service's account, configure WCF to publish that SPN to the service's clients through its metadata (WSDL). This is done by setting the endpoint identity for the exposed endpoint, either though an application configuration file or code. The following example publishes the identity programmatically.  \n  \n For more information about SPNs, the Kerberos protocol, and Active Directory, see [Kerberos Technical Supplement for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=88330).

If you are using the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to generate the client, the service's SPN will be automatically propagated to the client from the service's metadata (WSDL), if the service's metadata contains that information.
