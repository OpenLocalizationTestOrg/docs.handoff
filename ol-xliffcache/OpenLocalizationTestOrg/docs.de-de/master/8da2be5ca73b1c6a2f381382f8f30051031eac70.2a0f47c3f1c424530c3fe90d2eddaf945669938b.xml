Graphics Classes\nThe following topics describe how to use the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API in the managed class framework.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)  \n Describes how to accomplish basic tasks with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)  \n Demonstrates how to construct a pen and use it to draw a variety of lines and shapes.  \n  \n [Using a Brush to Fill Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)  \n Demonstrates how to construct a brush and fill shapes with a variety of effects.  \n  \n [Using a Gradient Brush to Fill Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-gradient-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)  \n Shows how to create and use different types of gradient brushes.  \n  \n [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)  \n Demonstrates how to construct and manipulate images.  \n  \n [Alpha Blending Lines and Fills](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/alpha-blending-lines-and-fills.md)  \n Demonstrates how to achieve transparency for shapes and lines.  \n  \n [Using Fonts and Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-fonts-and-text.md)  \n Shows how to draw text and use fonts and font families.  \n  \n [Constructing and Drawing Curves](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-curves.md)  \n Shows how to draw Cardinal and Bezier splines.  \n  \n [Constructing and Drawing Paths](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)  \n Shows how to create figures using paths.  \n  \n [Using Transformations in Managed GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-transformations-in-managed-gdi.md)  \n Demonstrates matrix transformations.  \n  \n [Using Graphics Containers](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-graphics-containers.md)  \n Shows how to manage graphics object state and nested graphics containers.  \n  \n [Using Regions](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-regions.md)  \n Demonstrates hit testing and clipping with regions.  \n  \n [Recoloring Images](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/recoloring-images.md)  \n Demonstrates various aspects of manipulating colors.  \n  \n [Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)  \n Show how to use image encoders and decoders to manipulate images.  \n  \n [Double Buffered Graphics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/double-buffered-graphics.md)  \n Demonstrates how to reduce flicker with double buffering.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"Using Managed
