Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [GroupBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)  \n Describes how to use this control to group controls.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[525,557],"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[558,682],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[683,746]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[747,857]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue.","pos":[858,930]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control; however, only the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control displays a caption, and only the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control can have scroll bars.","pos":[931,1200],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars."},{"pos":[1209,1224],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GroupBox Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1228,1344],"source":"[GroupBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.","pos":[1348,1414]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)</ept>","pos":[1421,1596],"source":"[How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to use this control to group controls.","pos":[1600,1652]},{"pos":[1661,1670],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1714,1768]},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1812,1866]},{"pos":[1875,1891],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1895,2011],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[2015,2106]}]}
