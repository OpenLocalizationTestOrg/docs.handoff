To do this, it must create an object from the specified class, which requires a `New` clause.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36011  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you have already acquired the resource, use a reference variable or expression in the `Using` statement that evaluates to the acquired resource.  \n  \n     `Dim newFont As New System.Drawing.Font`  \n  \n     `Using newFont`  \n  \n-   If you have not already acquired the resource, add a `New` clause to the `Using` statement.  \n  \n     `Using newFont as`   `New`   `System.Drawing.Font`  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md)\n- [New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)\n- [How to: Dispose of a System Resource](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/how-to-dispose-of-a-system-resource.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,223],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36011\"\n  - \"bc36011\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36011\"\nms.assetid: 5db996a6-0802-4b67-91f1-4aa9c3dd6b09","nodes":[{"content":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","nodes":[{"content":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[230,292],"content":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","linkify":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","nodes":[{"content":"'Using' resource variable must have an explicit initialization","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[293,393],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`Using`</ph> statement specifies at least one resource that it does not initialize with a <ph id=\"ph2\">`New`</ph> clause.","source":"A `Using` statement specifies at least one resource that it does not initialize with a `New` clause."},{"content":"If you have not already acquired the resource before passing control to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Using`</ph> block, the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Using`</ph> statement must acquire the resource.","pos":[400,539],"source":"If you have not already acquired the resource before passing control to the `Using` block, the `Using` statement must acquire the resource."},{"content":"To do this, it must create an object from the specified class, which requires a <ph id=\"ph1\">`New`</ph> clause.","pos":[540,633],"source":" To do this, it must create an object from the specified class, which requires a `New` clause."},{"pos":[640,661],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36011","source":"**Error ID:** BC36011"},{"pos":[670,691],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[701,848],"content":"If you have already acquired the resource, use a reference variable or expression in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Using`</ph> statement that evaluates to the acquired resource.","source":"If you have already acquired the resource, use a reference variable or expression in the `Using` statement that evaluates to the acquired resource."},{"pos":[935,1026],"content":"If you have not already acquired the resource, add a <ph id=\"ph1\">`New`</ph> clause to the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Using`</ph> statement.","source":"If you have not already acquired the resource, add a `New` clause to the `Using` statement."},{"pos":[1037,1087],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`Using newFont as`</ph>   <ph id=\"ph2\">`New`</ph>   <ph id=\"ph3\">`System.Drawing.Font`</ph>","source":"`Using newFont as`   `New`   `System.Drawing.Font`"},{"pos":[1096,1104],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1108,1194],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1197,1276],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>New Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1279,1425],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Dispose of a System Resource<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/how-to-dispose-of-a-system-resource.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Dispose of a System Resource](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/control-flow/how-to-dispose-of-a-system-resource.md)"}]}
