The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property helps you size the controls to fit larger or smaller captions, which is particularly useful if the caption will change at run time.  \n  \n### To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents  \n  \n1.  Set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> is set to `false`, the words specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.Text%2A> property will wrap to the next line if possible, but the control will not grow.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)\n- [Label Control Overview](label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [Label Control](label-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,379],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"captions [Windows Forms], sizing\"\n  - \"sizing controls\"\n  - \"size [Windows Forms], controls\"\n  - \"labels [Windows Forms], sizing to fit contents\"\n  - \"Label control [Windows Forms], sizing to fit contents\"\nms.assetid: 99648964-63b2-438c-980e-d24103ad602b","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[386,448],"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","linkify":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label&gt;</ph> control can be single-line or multi-line, and it can be either fixed in size or can automatically resize itself to accommodate its caption.","pos":[449,640],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control can be single-line or multi-line, and it can be either fixed in size or can automatically resize itself to accommodate its caption."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A&gt;</ph> property helps you size the controls to fit larger or smaller captions, which is particularly useful if the caption will change at run time.","pos":[641,831],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property helps you size the controls to fit larger or smaller captions, which is particularly useful if the caption will change at run time."},{"pos":[841,903],"content":"To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents","linkify":"To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents","nodes":[{"content":"To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[913,986],"content":"Set its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`true`</ph>.","source":"Set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property to `true`."},{"pos":[993,1209],"content":"If <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A&gt;</ph> is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>, the words specified in the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property will wrap to the next line if possible, but the control will not grow.","source":"If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> is set to `false`, the words specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.Text%2A> property will wrap to the next line if possible, but the control will not grow."},{"pos":[1218,1226],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1230,1356],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)"},{"pos":[1359,1424],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Label Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Label Control Overview](label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1427,1474],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Label Control<ept id=\"p1\">](label-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Label Control](label-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
