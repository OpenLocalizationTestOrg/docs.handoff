The class is not intended for use in real-world scenarios. It just uses the name and length in bytes of each file to determine whether the contents of each folder are identical or not. In a real-world scenario, you should modify this comparer to perform a more rigorous equality check.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \nModule CompareDirs  \n    Public Sub Main()  \n  \n        ' Create two identical or different temporary folders   \n        ' on a local drive and add files to them.  \n        ' Then set these file paths accordingly.  \n        Dim pathA As String = \"C:\\TestDir\"  \n        Dim pathB As String = \"C:\\TestDir2\"  \n  \n        ' Take a snapshot of the file system.   \n        Dim dir1 As New System.IO.DirectoryInfo(pathA)  \n        Dim dir2 As New System.IO.DirectoryInfo(pathB)  \n  \n        Dim list1 = dir1.GetFiles(\"*.*\", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories)  \n        Dim list2 = dir2.GetFiles(\"*.*\", System.IO.SearchOption.AllDirectories)  \n  \n        ' Create the FileCompare object we'll use in each query  \n        Dim myFileCompare As New FileCompare  \n  \n        ' This query determines whether the two folders contain  \n        ' identical file lists, based on the custom file comparer  \n        ' that is defined in the FileCompare class.  \n        ' The query executes immediately because it returns a bool.  \n        Dim areIdentical As Boolean = list1.SequenceEqual(list2, myFileCompare)  \n        If areIdentical = True Then  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The two folders are the same.\")  \n        Else  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The two folders are not the same.\")  \n        End If  \n  \n        ' Find common files in both folders. It produces a sequence and doesn't execute  \n        ' until the foreach statement.  \n        Dim queryCommonFiles = list1.Intersect(list2, myFileCompare)  \n  \n        If queryCommonFiles.Count() > 0 Then  \n  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The following files are in both folders:\")  \n            For Each fi As System.IO.FileInfo In queryCommonFiles  \n                Console.WriteLine(fi.FullName)  \n            Next  \n        Else  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"There are no common files in the two folders.\")  \n        End If  \n  \n        ' Find the set difference between the two folders.  \n        ' For this example we only check one way.  \n        Dim queryDirAOnly = list1.Except(list2, myFileCompare)  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The following files are in dirA but not dirB:\")  \n        For Each fi As System.IO.FileInfo In queryDirAOnly  \n            Console.WriteLine(fi.FullName)  \n        Next  \n  \n        ' Keep the console window open in debug mode  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\")  \n        Console.ReadKey()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ' This implementation defines a very simple comparison  \n    ' between two FileInfo objects. It only compares the name  \n    ' of the files being compared and their length in bytes.  \n    Public Class FileCompare  \n        Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer(Of System.IO.FileInfo)  \n  \n        Public Function Equals1(ByVal x As System.IO.FileInfo, ByVal y As System.IO.FileInfo) _  \n            As Boolean Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer(Of System.IO.FileInfo).Equals  \n  \n            If (x.Name = y.Name) And (x.Length = y.Length) Then  \n                Return True  \n            Else  \n                Return False  \n            End If  \n        End Function  \n  \n        ' Return a hash that reflects the comparison criteria. According to the   \n        ' rules for IEqualityComparer(Of T), if Equals is true, then the hash codes must  \n        ' also be equal.
