With Application Settings, you can store not only application data such as database connection strings, but also user-specific data, such as toolbar positions and most-recently used lists.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Application Settings Overview](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)  \n Discusses how to create and store settings data on behalf of your application and your users.  \n  \n [Application Settings Architecture](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-architecture.md)  \n Describes how the Application Settings feature works, and explores advanced features of the architecture such as grouped settings and settings keys.  \n  \n [Application Settings Attributes](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-attributes.md)  \n Lists and describes the attributes that can be applied to an application settings wrapper class or its settings properties.  \n  \n [Application Settings for Custom Controls](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-for-custom-controls.md)  \n Discusses what must be done to give your custom controls the ability to persist application settings when hosted in third-party applications.  \n  \n [How to: Create Application Settings](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-application-settings.md)  \n Demonstrates creating new application settings that are persisted between application sessions.  \n  \n [How to: Validate Application Settings](~/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-validate-application-settings.md)  \n Demonstrates validating application settings before they are persisted.  \n  \n## Related topics\n\n[Windows Forms Configuration Section](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/winforms/index.md)    \nDocuments the settings to enable High DPI support in Windows Forms Application starting with the .NET Framework 4.7.\n\n## See also  \n  \n[Windows Forms](../index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"Application Settings for Windows Forms | Microsoft
