Publishing service metadata makes the metadata available using standardized protocols, such as WS-MetadataExchange (MEX) and HTTP/GET requests. Metadata endpoints are similar to other service endpoints in that they have an address, a binding, and a contract, and they can be added to a service host through configuration or in code. To enable publishing metadata endpoints, you must add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> service behavior to the service.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md)  \n Demonstrates how to configure a WCF service to publish metadata so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string.  \n  \n [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable metadata publishing for a WCF service in code so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Publishing Metadata](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/publishing-metadata.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,113],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Publishing Metadata Endpoints\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 29cd8a60-dfb7-460c-bf5a-c2b31b782671","nodes":[{"content":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","nodes":[{"content":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[120,149],"content":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","linkify":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","nodes":[{"content":"Publishing Metadata Endpoints","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services publish metadata by publishing one or more metadata endpoints.","pos":[150,260]},{"content":"Publishing service metadata makes the metadata available using standardized protocols, such as WS-MetadataExchange (MEX) and HTTP/GET requests.","pos":[261,404]},{"content":"Metadata endpoints are similar to other service endpoints in that they have an address, a binding, and a contract, and they can be added to a service host through configuration or in code.","pos":[405,593]},{"content":"To enable publishing metadata endpoints, you must add the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior&gt;</ph> service behavior to the service.","pos":[594,747],"source":" To enable publishing metadata endpoints, you must add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> service behavior to the service."},{"pos":[756,771],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md)</ept>","pos":[775,955],"source":"[How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md)"},{"content":"Demonstrates how to configure a WCF service to publish metadata so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`?wsdl`</ph> query string.","pos":[959,1147],"source":"Demonstrates how to configure a WCF service to publish metadata so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md)</ept>","pos":[1154,1302],"source":"[How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md)"},{"content":"Demonstrates how to enable metadata publishing for a WCF service in code so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`?wsdl`</ph> query string.","pos":[1306,1503],"source":"Demonstrates how to enable metadata publishing for a WCF service in code so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string."},{"pos":[1512,1520],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1524,1613],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Publishing Metadata<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/publishing-metadata.md)</ept>","source":"[Publishing Metadata](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/publishing-metadata.md)"}]}
