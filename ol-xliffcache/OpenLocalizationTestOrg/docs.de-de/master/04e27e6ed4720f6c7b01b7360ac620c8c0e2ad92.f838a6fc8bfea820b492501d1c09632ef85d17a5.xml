There are times, however, when one or the other is more appropriate to a task.  \n  \n Generally, a combo box is appropriate when there is a list of suggested choices, and a list box is appropriate when you want to limit input to what is on the list. A combo box contains a text box field, so choices not on the list can be typed in. The exception is when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.DropDownStyle%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBoxStyle>. In that case, the control will select an item if you type its first letter.  \n  \n In addition, combo boxes save space on a form. Because the full list is not displayed until the user clicks the down arrow, a combo box can easily fit in a small space where a list box would not fit. An exception is when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox.DropDownStyle%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBoxStyle>: the full list is displayed, and the combo box takes up more room than a list box would.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>   \n [How to: Add and Remove Items from a Windows Forms ComboBox, ListBox, or CheckedListBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-and-remove-items-from-a-wf-combobox.md)   \n [How to: Sort the Contents of a Windows Forms ComboBox, ListBox, or CheckedListBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/sort-the-contents-of-a-wf-combobox-listbox-or-checkedlistbox-control.md)   \n [Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,839],"nodes":[{"content":"When to Use a Windows Forms ComboBox Instead of a ListBox | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,74],"content":"When to Use a Windows Forms ComboBox Instead of a ListBox | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"When to Use a Windows Forms ComboBox Instead of a ListBox | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,74]}]}],"pos":[6,83],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"When to Use a Windows Forms ComboBox Instead of a ListBox | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
