The underscore must be immediately preceded by a space and immediately followed by a line terminator (carriage return). For example:  \n  \n```  \nDim books As XDocument = _  \n    XDocument.Load(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath & _  \n                 \"\\..\\..\\Data\\books.xml\")  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30999  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the line continuation character (_) is the last character on a line of code.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that there is a space before the line continuation character, separating it from any other code on the line.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,156],"content":"Line continuation character &#39;_&#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Line continuation character &amp;#39;_&amp;#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,144],"source":"Line continuation character &#39;_&#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[672,799],"content":"Line continuation character &#39;_&#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","linkify":"Line continuation character &#39;_&#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","nodes":[{"content":"Line continuation character &amp;#39;_&amp;#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","pos":[0,127],"source":"Line continuation character &#39;_&#39; must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line"}]},{"content":"You can use the line-continuation character, which is an underscore (_), to break a long line of code over several lines in your file.","pos":[800,934]},{"content":"The underscore must be immediately preceded by a space and immediately followed by a line terminator (carriage return).","pos":[935,1054]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[1055,1067]},{"pos":[1221,1242],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30999","source":"**Error ID:** BC30999"},{"pos":[1251,1272],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the line continuation character (_) is the last character on a line of code.","pos":[1282,1370]},{"content":"Ensure that there is a space before the line continuation character, separating it from any other code on the line.","pos":[1380,1495]},{"pos":[1504,1512],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1516,1665],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)"}]}
