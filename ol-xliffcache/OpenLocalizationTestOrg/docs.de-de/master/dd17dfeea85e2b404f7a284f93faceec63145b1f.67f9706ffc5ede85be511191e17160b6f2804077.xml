It uses the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.RowSpan%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> attached properties, together with <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle> elements, which fill the backgrounds of various columns and rows. This design is possible because more than one element can exist in each cell in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, a principle difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> and <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Table>.\n\nThe example uses vertical gradients to <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> the columns and rows to improve the visual presentation and readability of the calendar. Styled <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements represent the dates and days of the week. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements are absolutely positioned within their cells by using the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property and alignment properties that are defined within the style for the application.\n\n[!code-xaml[GridComplex#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridComplex/CS/default.xaml#1)]\n\nThe following image shows the resulting control, a customizable calendar:\n\n![Screenshot of the resulting control](././media/how-to-create-a-complex-grid/wpf-manual-calendar.png)\n\n## See also\n\n-
