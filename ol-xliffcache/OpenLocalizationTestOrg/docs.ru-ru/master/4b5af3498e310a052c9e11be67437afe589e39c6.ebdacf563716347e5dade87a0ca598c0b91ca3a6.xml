demonstrate basic [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] functionality.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Built-in Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/built-in-activities.md)  \n Contains samples that use the built-in activity library.  \n  \n [Compensation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/compensation-samples.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate compensation.  \n  \n [Custom Activities](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-activities.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate creating custom activities.  \n  \n [Designer](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/designer.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate how to use [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)].  \n  \n [Designer ReHosting](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/designer-rehosting.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate re-hosting the activity designer.  \n  \n [Execution](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/execution.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate executing workflows.  \n  \n [Expressions](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/expressions.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] expressions.  \n  \n [Migration](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/migration.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate migrating workflows created with previous versions of [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n [Persistence](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/persistence.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate persisting workflows to a durable medium.  \n  \n [Rules Samples](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/rules-samples.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate using the workflow rules engine from [!INCLUDE[netfx35_short](../../../../includes/netfx35-short-md.md)].  \n  \n [Services](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/services.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate workflow services.  \n  \n [Tracking](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/tracking.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate workflow tracking.  \n  \n [Transactions](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/transactions.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate workflow transactions.  \n  \n [Validation](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/validation.md)  \n Contains samples that demonstrate validation in [!INCLUDE[wf2](../../../../includes/wf2-md.md)].  \n
