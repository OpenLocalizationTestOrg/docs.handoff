Points on the screen are described by x- and y-coordinate pairs, with the x-coordinates increasing to the right and the y-coordinates increasing from top to bottom. The location of the origin, relative to the screen, will vary depending on whether you are specifying screen or client coordinates.  \n  \n## Screen Coordinates  \n A Windows Forms application specifies the position of a window on the screen in screen coordinates. For screen coordinates, the origin is the upper-left corner of the screen. The full position of a window is often described by a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> structure containing the screen coordinates of two points that define the upper-left and lower-right corners of the window.  \n  \n## Client Coordinates  \n A Windows Forms application specifies the position of points in a form or control using client coordinates. The origin for client coordinates is the upper-left corner of the client area of the control or form. Client coordinates ensure that an application can use consistent coordinate values while drawing in a form or control, regardless of the position of the form or control on the screen.  \n  \n The dimensions of the client area are also described by a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> structure that contains client coordinates for the area. In all cases, the upper-left coordinate of the rectangle is included in the client area, while the lower-right coordinate is excluded. Graphics operations do not include the right and lower edges of a client area. For example the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillRectangle%2A> method will fill up to the right and lower edge of the specified rectangle, but will not include these edges.  \n  \n## Mapping From One Type of Coordinate to Another  \n Occasionally, you may need to map from screen coordinates to client coordinates. You can easily accomplish this by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PointToClient%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PointToScreen%2A> methods available in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> class. For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MousePosition%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> is reported in screen coordinates, but you may want to convert these to client coordinates.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PointToClient%2A>\n-
