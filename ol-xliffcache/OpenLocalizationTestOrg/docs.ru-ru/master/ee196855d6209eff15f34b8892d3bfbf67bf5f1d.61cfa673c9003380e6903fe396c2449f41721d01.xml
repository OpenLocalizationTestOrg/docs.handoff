This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the `PrintPreviewControl` only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface. If you want the standard user interface, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PrintPreviewControl Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintPreviewControl`, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [PrintPreviewDialog Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes an alternate way to create print preview functionality.  \n  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,72],"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[627,670],"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph> is used to display a document as it will appear when printed.","pos":[671,772],"source":"The Windows Forms `PrintPreviewControl` is used to display a document as it will appear when printed."},{"content":"This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph> only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface.","pos":[773,946],"source":" This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the `PrintPreviewControl` only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface."},{"content":"If you want the standard user interface, use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[947,1049],"source":" If you want the standard user interface, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control."},{"pos":[1058,1073],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintPreviewControl Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1077,1215],"source":"[PrintPreviewControl Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Introduces the general concepts of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph>, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component.","pos":[1219,1352],"source":" Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintPreviewControl`, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component."},{"pos":[1361,1370],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Provides reference information on the class and its members.","pos":[1425,1485]},{"pos":[1494,1510],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintPreviewDialog Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1514,1632],"source":"[PrintPreviewDialog Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Describes an alternate way to create print preview functionality.","pos":[1636,1701]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1708,1824],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1828,1919]}]}
