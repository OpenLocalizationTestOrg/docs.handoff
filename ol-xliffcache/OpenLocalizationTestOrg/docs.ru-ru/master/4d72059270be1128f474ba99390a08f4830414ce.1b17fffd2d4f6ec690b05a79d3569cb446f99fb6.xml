Doing this is useful when you have a dataflow block that performs a long-running computation and can benefit from processing messages in parallel. This example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> class to perform multiple dataflow operations concurrently; however, you can specify the maximum degree of parallelism in any of the predefined execution block types that the TPL Dataflow Library provides, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformManyBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  The TPL Dataflow Library (the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow?displayProperty=fullName> namespace) is not distributed with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]. To install the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow> namespace, open your project in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], choose **Manage NuGet Packages** from the Project menu, and search online for the `Microsoft.Tpl.Dataflow` package.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example performs two dataflow computations and prints the elapsed time that is required for each computation. The first computation specifies a maximum degree of parallelism of 1, which is the default. A maximum degree of parallelism of 1 causes the dataflow block to process messages serially. The second computation resembles the first, except that it specifies a maximum degree of parallelism that is equal to the number of available processors. This enables the dataflow block to perform multiple operations in parallel.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_DegreeOfParallelism#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_degreeofparallelism/cs/dataflowdegreeofparallelism.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_DegreeOfParallelism#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_degreeofparallelism/vb/dataflowdegreeofparallelism.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.cs` (`DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  \n  \n **csc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.cs**  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]  \n  \n **vbc.exe /r:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll DataflowDegreeOfParallelism.vb**  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n By default, each predefined dataflow block propagates out messages in the order in which the messages are received.  Although multiple messages are processed simultaneously when you specify a maximum degree of parallelism that is greater than 1, they are still propagated out in the order in which they are received.  \n  \n Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism%2A> property represents the maximum degree of parallelism, the dataflow block might execute with a lesser degree of parallelism than you specify. The dataflow block can use a lesser degree of parallelism to meet its functional requirements or to account for a lack of available system resources. A dataflow block never chooses a greater degree of parallelism than you specify.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Dataflow](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,538],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"dataflow block, specifying parallelism in TPL\"\n  - \"Task Parallel Library, dataflows\"\n  - \"TPL dataflow library, specifying parallelism\"\nms.assetid: e4088541-ee05-40db-95f5-147cfe62fde7\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,78],"content":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,78]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[545,606],"content":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block","linkify":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify the Degree of Parallelism in a Dataflow Block","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"This document describes how to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> property to enable an execution dataflow block to process more than one message at a time.","pos":[607,856],"source":"This document describes how to set the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to enable an execution dataflow block to process more than one message at a time."},{"content":"Doing this is useful when you have a dataflow block that performs a long-running computation and can benefit from processing messages in parallel.","pos":[857,1003]},{"content":"This example uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class to perform multiple dataflow operations concurrently; however, you can specify the maximum degree of parallelism in any of the predefined execution block types that the TPL Dataflow Library provides, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformManyBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1004,1543],"source":" This example uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601?displayProperty=fullName> class to perform multiple dataflow operations concurrently; however, you can specify the maximum degree of parallelism in any of the predefined execution block types that the TPL Dataflow Library provides, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601>, <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.TransformManyBlock%602?displayProperty=fullName>."},{"pos":[1551,2015],"content":"[!TIP]\n The TPL Dataflow Library (the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow?displayProperty=fullName> namespace) is not distributed with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)].
