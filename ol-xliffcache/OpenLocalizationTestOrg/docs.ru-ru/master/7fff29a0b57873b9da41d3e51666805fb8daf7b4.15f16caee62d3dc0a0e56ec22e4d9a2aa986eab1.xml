You can select any WPF control types which are included in your project.  \n  \n In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:  \n  \n-   Create the project.  \n  \n-   Create the WPF control types.  \n  \n-   Select WPF controls.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `SelectingWpfContent`.  \n  \n## Creating the WPF Control Types  \n After you add WPF control types to the project, you can host them in different <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls.  \n  \n#### To create WPF control types  \n  \n1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> project to the solution. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n2.  In Design view, make sure that `UserControl1` is selected. For more information, see [How to: Select and Move Elements on the Design Surface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/54cb70b6-b35b-46e4-a0cc-65189399c474).  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to `200`.  \n  \n4.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> and set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property to **Hosted Content**.  \n  \n5.  Add a second WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to the project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl2.xaml`.  \n  \n6.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to `200`.  \n  \n7.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> and set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property to **Hosted Content 2**.  \n  \n **Note** In general, you should host more sophisticated WPF content. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control is used here for illustrative purposes only.  \n  \n1.  Build the project.  \n  \n## Selecting WPF Controls  \n You can assign different WPF content to an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control, which is already hosting content.  \n  \n#### To select WPF controls  \n  \n1.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, double-click `UserControl1` to create an instance of `UserControl1` on the form.  \n  \n     An instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  \n  \n3.  In the smart tag panel for `elementHost1`, open the **Select Hosted Content** drop-down list.  \n  \n4.  Select **UserControl2** from the drop-down list box.  \n  \n     The `elementHost1` control now hosts an instance of the `UserControl2` type.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties** window, confirm that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost.Child%2A> property is set to **UserControl2**.  \n  \n6.  From the **Toolbox**, in the **WPF Interoperability** group, drag an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control onto the form.  \n  \n     The default name for the new control is `elementHost2`.  \n  \n7.  In the smart tag panel for `elementHost2`, open the **Select Hosted Content** drop-down list.  \n  \n8.  Select **UserControl1** from the drop-down list.  \n  \n9. The `elementHost2` control now hosts an instance of the `UserControl1` type.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>   \n [Migration and Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)   \n [Using WPF Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-wpf-controls.md)   \n [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,691],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WPF content [Windows Forms], assigning at design time\"\n  - \"ElementHost control, assigning WPF content at design time\"\n  - \"interoperability [WPF]\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, content assignments\"\n  - \"WPF user control, hosting in Windows Forms\"\nms.assetid: b3e9ef93-7e0f-4a2f-8f1e-3437609a1eb7\ncaps.latest.revision: 18\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,83],"content":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,83]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[698,764],"content":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","linkify":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough show you how to select the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control types you want to display on your form.","pos":[765,894]},{"content":"You can select any WPF control types which are included in your project.","pos":[895,967]},{"content":"In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:","pos":[974,1027]},{"content":"Create the project.","pos":[1037,1056]},{"content":"Create the WPF control types.","pos":[1066,1095]},{"content":"Select WPF controls.","pos":[1105,1125]},{"pos":[1133,1509],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
