The returned sequence contains the elements that are common to both of the input sequences.  \n  \n ![Graphic showing the intersection of two sequences.](./media/set-operations/intersection-two-sequences.png)    \n### Union  \n The following illustration depicts a union operation on two sequences of characters.
