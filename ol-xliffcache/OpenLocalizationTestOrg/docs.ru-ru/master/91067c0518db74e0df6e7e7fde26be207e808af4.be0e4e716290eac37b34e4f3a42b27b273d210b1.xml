The following table summarizes details about the essential points and related topics in this section.  \n  \n The reliable session [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] provides ensures that messages sent between endpoints are transferred across SOAP or transport intermediaries and are delivered only once and, optionally, in the same order in which they were sent.  \n  \n To use a reliable session with a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application, either use one of the system-provided bindings in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] that support a reliable session by default or as an option, or create your own custom binding that supports the session.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Reliable Sessions Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/reliable-sessions-overview.md)  \n Describes reliable sessions, when to use them, the different bindings that
