The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control, in conjunction with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, provides a convenient and extensible solution for moving through a collection and displaying items sequentially.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control to move through data. The set is contained in a <xref:System.Data.DataView>, which is bound to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database.
