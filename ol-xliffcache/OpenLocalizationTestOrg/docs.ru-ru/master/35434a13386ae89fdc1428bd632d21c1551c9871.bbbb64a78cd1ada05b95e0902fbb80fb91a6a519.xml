The example shows you how to partition space by creating five <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle> elements and positioning (docking) them inside a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>. If you retain the default setting, the final rectangle fills all the remaining unallocated space.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DockPanelCode#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DockPanelCode/CSharp/DockPanel_Code.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DockPanelCode#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DockPanelCode/VisualBasic/dockpanel_vb.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Dock>\n- [Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a DockPanel\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [WPF], DockPanel\"\n  - \"DockPanel control [WPF], creating\"\nms.assetid: 9194f663-e279-4f1a-86d7-125a57d05c6f","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a DockPanel","nodes":[{"pos":[0,26],"content":"How to: Create a DockPanel","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a DockPanel","pos":[0,26]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[245,271],"content":"How to: Create a DockPanel","linkify":"How to: Create a DockPanel","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a DockPanel","pos":[0,26]}]},{"pos":[275,282],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates and uses an instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> by using code.","pos":[286,395],"source":"The following example creates and uses an instance of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> by using code."},{"content":"The example shows you how to partition space by creating five <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle&gt;</ph> elements and positioning (docking) them inside a parent <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[396,594],"source":" The example shows you how to partition space by creating five <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Rectangle> elements and positioning (docking) them inside a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>."},{"content":"If you retain the default setting, the final rectangle fills all the remaining unallocated space.","pos":[595,692]},{"pos":[944,952],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1037,1074],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Panels Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](panels-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)"}]}
