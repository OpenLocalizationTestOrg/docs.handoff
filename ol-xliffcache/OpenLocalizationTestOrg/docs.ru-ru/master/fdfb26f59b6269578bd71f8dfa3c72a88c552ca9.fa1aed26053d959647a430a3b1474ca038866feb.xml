The figure consists of a single arc. The arc has a sweep angle of –180 degrees, which is counterclockwise in the default coordinate system.  \n  \n-   The second example creates a path that has two figures. The first figure is an arc followed by a line. The second figure is a line followed by a curve followed by a line. The first figure is left open, and the second figure is closed.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths#21](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths#21](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths#22](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths/CS/Class1.cs#22)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths#22](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingPaths/VB/Class1.vb#22)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The previous examples are designed for use with Windows Forms, and they require <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>   \n [Constructing and Drawing Paths](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)   \n [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,506],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"figures, creating from shapes\"\n  - \"figures, creating from lines\"\nms.assetid: 82fd56c7-b443-4765-9b7c-62ce030656ec\ncaps.latest.revision: 14\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,70],"content":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,70]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[513,566],"content":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes","linkify":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"To create a figure, construct a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph>, and then call methods, such as <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddLine%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddCurve%2A&gt;</ph>, to add primitives to the path.","pos":[567,824],"source":"To create a figure, construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>, and then call methods, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddLine%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.AddCurve%2A>, to add primitives to the path."},{"pos":[833,840],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code examples create paths that have figures:","pos":[844,903]},{"content":"The first example creates a path that has a single figure.","pos":[913,971]},{"content":"The figure consists of a single arc.
