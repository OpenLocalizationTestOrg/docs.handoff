Expression. Must evaluate to `True` or `False`, or to a data type that is implicitly convertible to `Boolean`.  \n  \n If the expression is a [Nullable](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)`Boolean` variable that evaluates to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md), the condition is treated as if the expression is not `True`, and the `Else` block is executed.  \n  \n `Then`  \n Required in the single-line syntax; optional in the multiple-line syntax.  \n  \n `statements`  \n Optional. One or more statements following `If`...`Then` that are executed if `condition` evaluates to `True`.  \n  \n `elseifcondition`  \n Required if `ElseIf` is present. Expression. Must evaluate to `True` or `False`, or to a data type that is implicitly convertible to `Boolean`.  \n  \n `elseifstatements`  \n Optional. One or more statements following `ElseIf`...`Then` that are executed if `elseifcondition` evaluates to `True`.  \n  \n `elsestatements`  \n Optional. One or more statements that are executed if no previous `condition` or `elseifcondition` expression evaluates to `True`.  \n  \n `End If`  \n Terminates the `If`...`Then`...`Else` block.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n  \n## Multiple-Line Syntax  \n When an `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement is encountered, `condition` is tested. If `condition` is `True`, the statements following `Then` are executed. If `condition` is `False`, each `ElseIf` statement (if there are any) is evaluated in order. When a `True``elseifcondition` is found, the statements immediately following the associated `ElseIf` are executed. If no `elseifcondition` evaluates to `True`, or if there are no `ElseIf` statements, the statements following `Else` are executed. After executing the statements following `Then`, `ElseIf`, or `Else`, execution continues with the statement following `End If`.  \n  \n The `ElseIf` and `Else` clauses are both optional. You can have as many `ElseIf` clauses as you want in an `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement, but no `ElseIf` clause can appear after an `Else` clause. `If`...`Then`...`Else` statements can be nested within each other.  \n  \n In the multiple-line syntax, the `If` statement must be the only statement on the first line. The `ElseIf`, `Else`, and `End If` statements can be preceded only by a line label. The `If`...`Then`...`Else` block must end with an `End If` statement.  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  The [Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md) might be more useful when you evaluate a single expression that has several possible values.  \n  \n## Single-Line Syntax  \n You can use the single-line syntax for short, simple tests. However, the multiple-line syntax provides more structure and flexibility and is usually easier to read, maintain, and debug.  \n  \n What follows the `Then` keyword is examined to determine whether a statement is a single-line `If`. If anything other than a comment appears after `Then` on the same line, the statement is treated as a single-line `If` statement. If `Then` is absent, it must be the start of a multiple-line `If`...`Then`...`Else`.  \n  \n In the single-line syntax, you can have multiple statements executed as the result of an `If`...`Then` decision. All statements must be on the same line and be separated by colons.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example illustrates the use of the multiple-line syntax of the `If`...`Then`...`Else` statement.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#101](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/if-then-else-statement_1.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example
