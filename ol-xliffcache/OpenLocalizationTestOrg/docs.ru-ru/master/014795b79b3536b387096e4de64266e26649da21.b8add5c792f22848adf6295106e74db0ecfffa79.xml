By using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices>, workflows can be searched for specific child activities, individual activities and their properties can be enumerated, and runtime metadata of the activities can be cached at a specific time. This topic provides an overview of <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices> and how to use it to inspect an activity tree.  \n  \n## Using WorkflowInspectionServices  \n The <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> method is used to enumerate all of the activities in the specified activity tree. <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> returns an enumerable that touches all activities within the tree including children, delegate handlers, variable defaults, and argument expressions. In the following example, a workflow definition is created by using a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine>, and expressions. After the workflow definition is created, it is invoked and then the `InspectActivity` method is called.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CFX_WorkflowApplicationExample#45](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_workflowapplicationexample/cs/program.cs#45)]  \n  \n To enumerate the activities, the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> is called on the root activity, and again recursively on each returned activity. In the following example, the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of each activity and expression in the activity tree is written to the console.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CFX_WorkflowApplicationExample#46](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_workflowapplicationexample/cs/program.cs#46)]  \n  \n This sample code provides the following output.  \n  \n **List Item 1**  \n**List Item 2**   \n**List Item 3**   \n**List Item 4**   \n**List Item 5**   \n**Items added to collection.**   \n**Sequence**   \n **Literal<List\\<String>>**  \n **While**  \n **AddToCollection\\<String>**  \n **VariableValue<ICollection\\<String>>**  \n **LambdaValue\\<String>**  \n **LocationReferenceValue<List\\<String>>**  \n **LambdaValue\\<Boolean>**  \n **LocationReferenceValue<List\\<String>>**  \n **ForEach\\<String>**  \n **VariableValue<IEnumerable\\<String>>**  \n **WriteLine**  \n **DelegateArgumentValue\\<String>**  \n **Sequence**  \n **WriteLine**  \n **Literal\\<String>**  To retrieve a specific activity instead of enumerating all of the activities, <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.Resolve%2A> is used. Both <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.Resolve%2A> and <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> perform metadata caching if `WorkflowInspectionServices.CacheMetadata` has not been previously called. If <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.CacheMetadata%2A> has been called then <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> is based on the existing metadata. Therefore, if tree changes have been made since the last call to <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.CacheMetadata%2A>, <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A> might give unexpected results. If changes have been made to the workflow after calling <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.GetActivities%2A>, metadata can be re-cached by calling the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices> <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices.Validate%2A> method. Caching metadata is discussed in the next section.  \n  \n### Caching Metadata  \n Caching the metadata for an activity builds and validates a description of the activity’s arguments, variables, child activities, and activity delegates. Metadata, by default, is cached by the runtime when an activity is prepared for execution. If a workflow host author wants to cache the metadata for an activity or activity tree before this, for example to take all of the cost upfront, then <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices.CacheMetadata%2A> can be used to cache the metadata at the desired time.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,108],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Activity Tree Inspection\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
