For more information, see [Updating the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/updating-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to create an existing `Customer` object that contains changes to be saved to the data service. The object is attached to the context and the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.UpdateObject%2A> method is called to mark the attached object as <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.EntityStates> before the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.SaveChanges%2A> method is called.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind
