To do this, you must determine the transport format in which the XML stream is to be stored, either as a stream or as a file. For example, if the XML stream must be saved in a permanent form, create a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more examples of XML serialization, see [Examples of XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/examples-of-xml-serialization.md).  \n  \n### To serialize an object  \n  \n1.  Create the object and set its public fields and properties.  \n  \n2.  Construct a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> using the type of the object. For more information, see the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class constructors.  \n  \n3.  Call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A> method to generate either an XML stream or a file representation of the object's public properties and fields. The following example creates a file.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myObject As MySerializableClass = New MySerializableClass()  \n    ' Insert code to set properties and fields of the object.  \n    Dim mySerializer As XmlSerializer = New XmlSerializer(GetType(MySerializableClass))  \n    ' To write to a file, create a StreamWriter object.  \n    Dim myWriter As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(\"myFileName.xml\")  \n    mySerializer.Serialize(myWriter, myObject)  \n    myWriter.Close()  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    MySerializableClass myObject = new MySerializableClass();  \n    // Insert code to set properties and fields of the object.  \n    XmlSerializer mySerializer = new   \n    XmlSerializer(typeof(MySerializableClass));  \n    // To write to a file, create a StreamWriter object.  \n    StreamWriter myWriter = new StreamWriter(\"myFileName.xml\");  \n    mySerializer.Serialize(myWriter, myObject);  \n    myWriter.Close();  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introducing XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md)   \n [How to: Deserialize an Object](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-deserialize-an-object.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,56],"content":"How to: Serialize an Object | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Serialize an Object | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,44]}]},{"pos":[459,486],"content":"How to: Serialize an Object","linkify":"How to: Serialize an Object","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Serialize an Object","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"To serialize an object, first create the object that is to be serialized and set its public properties and fields.","pos":[487,601]},{"content":"To do this, you must determine the transport format in which the XML stream is to be stored, either as a stream or as a file.","pos":[602,727]},{"content":"For example, if the XML stream must be saved in a permanent form, create a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.FileStream&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[728,838],"source":" For example, if the XML stream must be saved in a permanent form, create a <xref:System.IO.FileStream> object."},{"pos":[846,1005],"content":"[!NOTE]\n For more examples of XML serialization, see [Examples of XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/examples-of-xml-serialization.md).","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"For more examples of XML serialization, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Examples of XML Serialization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/examples-of-xml-serialization.md)</ept>.","pos":[9,157],"source":" For more examples of XML serialization, see [Examples of XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/examples-of-xml-serialization.md)."}]},{"pos":[1015,1037],"content":"To serialize an object","linkify":"To serialize an object","nodes":[{"content":"To serialize an object","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Create the object and set its public fields and properties.","pos":[1047,1106]},{"content":"Construct a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt;</ph> using the type of the object.","pos":[1116,1203],"source":"Construct a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> using the type of the object."},{"content":"For more information, see the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt;</ph> class constructors.","pos":[1204,1299],"source":" For more information, see the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class constructors."},{"content":"Call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A&gt;</ph> method to generate either an XML stream or a file representation of the object's public properties and fields.","pos":[1309,1487],"source":"Call the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer.Serialize%2A> method to generate either an XML stream or a file representation of the object's public properties and fields."},{"content":"The following example creates a file.","pos":[1488,1525]},{"pos":[2432,2440],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introducing XML Serialization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2444,2548],"source":"[Introducing XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Deserialize an Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-deserialize-an-object.md)</ept>","pos":[2551,2654],"source":" [How to: Deserialize an Object](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-deserialize-an-object.md)"}]}
