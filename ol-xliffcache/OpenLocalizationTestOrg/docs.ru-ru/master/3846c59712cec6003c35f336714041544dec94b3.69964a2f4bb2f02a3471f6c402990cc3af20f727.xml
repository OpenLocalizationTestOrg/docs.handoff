In this section, *line* refers to any of these, unless specified to mean only a line segment. Set the properties of a pen to control the color, width, alignment, and style of lines drawn with that pen.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Use a Pen to Draw Lines](how-to-use-a-pen-to-draw-lines.md)  \n Explains how to draw lines.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Pen to Draw Rectangles](how-to-use-a-pen-to-draw-rectangles.md)  \n Describes how to draw rectangles.  \n  \n [How to: Set Pen Width and Alignment](how-to-set-pen-width-and-alignment.md)  \n Explains how to change the width and alignment of a `Pen` object.  \n  \n [How to: Draw a Line with Line Caps](how-to-draw-a-line-with-line-caps.md)  \n Describes how to add end caps when drawing a line.  \n  \n [How to: Join Lines](how-to-join-lines.md)  \n Shows how to join two lines.  \n  \n [How to: Draw a Custom Dashed Line](how-to-draw-a-custom-dashed-line.md)  \n Describes how to draw a dashed line.  \n  \n [How to: Draw a Line Filled with a Texture](how-to-draw-a-line-filled-with-a-texture.md)  \n Explains how to draw a texture-filled line.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,261],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
