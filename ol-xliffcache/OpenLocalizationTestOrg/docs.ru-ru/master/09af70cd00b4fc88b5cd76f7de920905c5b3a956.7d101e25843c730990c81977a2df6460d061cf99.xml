The example also demonstrates image sizing and layout possibilities with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/CPP/tictactoe.cpp#0)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/CS/tictactoe.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe#0](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.ImageColumn_TicTacToe/VB/tictactoe.vb#0)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>\n- [Programming with Cells, Rows, and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](programming-with-cells-rows-and-columns-in-the-datagrid.md)\n- [How to: Display Images in Cells of the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-display-images-in-cells-of-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,352],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"image columns\"\n  - \"image columns [Windows Forms], Windows Forms\"\n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], image columns\"\nms.assetid: 8a37aa75-3c6e-4893-91d0-7a5f34bfe287","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","nodes":[{"pos":[0,73],"content":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","pos":[0,73]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[359,432],"content":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","linkify":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","pos":[0,73]}]},{"content":"The following code example shows how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> image columns in an interactive user interface (UI).","pos":[433,574],"source":"The following code example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> image columns in an interactive user interface (UI)."},{"content":"The example also demonstrates image sizing and layout possibilities with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn&gt;</ph>.","pos":[575,704],"source":" The example also demonstrates image sizing and layout possibilities with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>."},{"pos":[713,720],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1319,1337],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1341,1363]},{"content":"References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.","pos":[1373,1434]},{"content":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md)</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Command-line Building With csc.exe<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1441,1795],"source":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)."},{"content":"You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.","pos":[1796,1884]},{"pos":[1893,1901],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2002,2147],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming with Cells, Rows, and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control<ept id=\"p1\">](programming-with-cells-rows-and-columns-in-the-datagrid.md)</ept>","source":"[Programming with Cells, Rows, and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](programming-with-cells-rows-and-columns-in-the-datagrid.md)"},{"pos":[2150,2302],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Display Images in Cells of the Windows Forms DataGridView Control<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-display-images-in-cells-of-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Display Images in Cells of the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-display-images-in-cells-of-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)"}]}
