To do this, we use a query that finds the string \"Hello\". This example builds on the previous examples in this tutorial. The new query is called out in comments in the code below.  \n  \n For instructions for creating the source document for this example, see [Creating the Source Office Open XML Document (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-the-source-office-open-xml-document.md).  \n  \n This example uses classes found in the WindowsBase assembly. It uses types in the <xref:System.IO.Packaging?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports <xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\">  \n  \nModule Module1  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As String In source  \n            sb.Append(s)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item))  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As T In source  \n            sb.Append(s).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String), ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item)).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Public Function ParagraphText(ByVal e As XElement) As String  \n        Dim w As XNamespace = e.Name.Namespace  \n        Return (e.<w:r>.<w:t>).StringConcatenate(Function(element) CStr(element))  \n    End Function  \n  \n    ' Following function is required because VB does not support short circuit evaluation  \n    Private Function GetStyleOfParagraph(ByVal styleNode As XElement, ByVal defaultStyle As String) As String  \n        If (styleNode Is Nothing) Then  \n            Return defaultStyle  \n        Else  \n            Return styleNode.@w:val  \n        End If  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim fileName = \"SampleDoc.docx\"  \n  \n        Dim documentRelationshipType = \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/officeDocument\"  \n        Dim stylesRelationshipType = \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/styles\"  \n        Dim wordmlNamespace = \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\"  \n        Dim xDoc As XDocument = Nothing  \n        Dim styleDoc As XDocument = Nothing  \n  \n        Using wdPackage As Package = Package.Open(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read)  \n            Dim docPackageRelationship As PackageRelationship = wdPackage.GetRelationshipsByType(documentRelationshipType).FirstOrDefault()  \n            If (docPackageRelationship IsNot Nothing) Then  \n                Dim documentUri As Uri = PackUriHelper.ResolvePartUri(New Uri(\"/\", UriKind.Relative), docPackageRelationship.TargetUri)  \n                Dim documentPart As PackagePart = wdPackage.GetPart(documentUri)  \n  \n                '  Load the document XML in the part into an XDocument instance.  \n                xDoc = XDocument.Load(XmlReader.Create(documentPart.GetStream()))  \n  \n                '  Find the styles part.

Because each query is implemented in a lazy, deferred fashion, each query does not yield its results until the query is iterated.
