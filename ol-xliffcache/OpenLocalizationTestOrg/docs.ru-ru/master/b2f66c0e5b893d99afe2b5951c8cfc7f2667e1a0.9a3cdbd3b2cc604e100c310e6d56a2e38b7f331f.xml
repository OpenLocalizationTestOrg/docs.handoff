[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] analytic tracing events are emitted at key points in the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] stack to allow troubleshooting of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services in a production environment. Analytic tracing for [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services has minimal impact on the performance of a product server that hosts [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services as these events are very efficiently emitted to an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Analytic Tracing Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-tracing-overview.md)  \n Discusses how
