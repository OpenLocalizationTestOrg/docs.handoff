A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.  \n  \n A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines. Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character. For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](../../../visual-basic/reference/language-specification.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30205  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.  \n  \n2.  Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)   \n [Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"End of statement expected | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"End of statement expected | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[619,644],"content":"End of statement expected","linkify":"End of statement expected","nodes":[{"content":"End of statement expected","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The statement is syntactically complete, but an additional programming element follows the element that completes the statement.","pos":[645,773]},{"content":"A line terminator is required at the end of every statement.","pos":[774,834]},{"content":"A line terminator divides the characters of a Visual Basic source file into lines.","pos":[841,923]},{"content":"Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&amp;HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&amp;HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character.","pos":[924,1125],"source":" Examples of line terminators are the Unicode carriage return character (&HD), the Unicode linefeed character (&HA), and the Unicode carriage return character followed by the Unicode linefeed character."},{"content":"For more information about line terminators, see the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Language Specification<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/language-specification.md)</ept>.","pos":[1126,1276],"source":" For more information about line terminators, see the [Visual Basic Language Specification](../../../visual-basic/reference/language-specification.md)."},{"pos":[1283,1304],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30205","source":"**Error ID:** BC30205"},{"pos":[1313,1334],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check to see if two different statements have inadvertently been put on the same line.","pos":[1344,1430]},{"content":"Insert a line terminator after the element that completes the statement.","pos":[1440,1512]},{"pos":[1521,1529],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1533,1686],"source":"[How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Statements<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)</ept>","pos":[1689,1775],"source":" [Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)"}]}
