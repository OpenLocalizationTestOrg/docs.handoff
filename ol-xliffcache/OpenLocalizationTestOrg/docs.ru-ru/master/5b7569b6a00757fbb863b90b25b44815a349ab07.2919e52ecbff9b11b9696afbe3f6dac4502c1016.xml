SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,108],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Calls Faulted Per Second\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 81c88073-8e32-4520-a71a-2c56b71ee515","nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"pos":[0,24],"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[0,24]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[115,139],"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","linkify":"Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[140,178]},{"pos":[187,198],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls that returned faults to this operation in a second.","pos":[202,269]},{"pos":[276,445],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula.","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula."},{"content":"(N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","pos":[452,485]},{"content":"In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[492,631]},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[632,830]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[831,917]},{"pos":[926,934],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[938,1091],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
