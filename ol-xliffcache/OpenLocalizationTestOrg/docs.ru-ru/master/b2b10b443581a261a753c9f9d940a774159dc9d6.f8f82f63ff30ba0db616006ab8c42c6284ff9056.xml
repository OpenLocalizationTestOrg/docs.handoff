You typically need to bind a control to a type at design time, when data may not be available, but you still want your data-bound controls to display data from a type's public interface. The following procedures demonstrate how to create a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> that is bound to a type, and then how to bind one of the type's properties to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>.  \n  \n### To bind the BindingSource to a type  \n  \n1.  Create a Windows Forms project (**File** > **New** > **Project** > **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** > **Classic Desktop** > **Windows Forms Application**).  \n  \n2.  In **Design** view, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component onto the form.  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, click the arrow for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataSource%2A> property.  \n  \n4.  In the **DataSource UI Type Editor**, click **Add Project Data Source**.  \n  \n5.  On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, select **Object** and click **Next**.  \n  \n6.  Select the type to bind to:  \n  \n    -   If the type you want to bind to is in the current project, or the assembly that contains the type is already added as a reference, expand the nodes to find the type you want, and then select it.  \n  \n         -or-  \n  \n    -   If the type you want to bind to is in another assembly, not currently in the list of references, click **Add Reference**, and then click the **Projects** tab. Select the project that contains the business object you want and click **OK**. This project will appear in the list of assemblies, so you can expand the nodes to find the type you want, and then select it.  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  If you want to bind to a type in a framework or Microsoft assembly, clear the **Hide assemblies that begin with Microsoft or System** check box.  \n  \n7.  Click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.  \n  \n### To bind the control to the BindingSource  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> to the form.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, expand the **(DataBindings)** node.  \n  \n3.  Click the arrow next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property.  \n  \n4.  In the **DataSource UI Type Editor**, expand the node for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> added previously, and select the property of the bound type you want to bind to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [BindingSource Component](bindingsource-component.md)\n- [How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)\n- [Bind controls to data in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/data-tools/bind-controls-to-data-in-visual-studio)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,335],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], binding to a type\"\n  - \"BindingSource component [Windows Forms], binding to a type\"\n  - \"types [Windows Forms], binding controls to\"\nms.assetid: 5ab984b5-c2d0-4638-a572-1c84013e8746","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","pos":[0,65]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[342,407],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type Using the Designer","pos":[0,65]}]},{"content":"When you are building controls that interact with data, you sometimes need to bind a control to a type, rather than an object.","pos":[408,534]},{"content":"You typically need to bind a control to a type at design time, when data may not be available, but you still want your data-bound controls to display data from a type's public interface.","pos":[535,721]},{"content":"The following procedures demonstrate how to create a new <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource&gt;</ph> that is bound to a type, and then how to bind one of the type's properties to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property of a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox&gt;</ph>.","pos":[722,997],"source":" The following procedures demonstrate how to create a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> that is bound to a type, and then how to bind one of the type's properties to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>."},{"pos":[1007,1042],"content":"To bind the BindingSource to a type","linkify":"To bind the BindingSource to a type","nodes":[{"content":"To bind the BindingSource to a type","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[1052,1208],"content":"Create a Windows Forms project (<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>File<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> &gt;
