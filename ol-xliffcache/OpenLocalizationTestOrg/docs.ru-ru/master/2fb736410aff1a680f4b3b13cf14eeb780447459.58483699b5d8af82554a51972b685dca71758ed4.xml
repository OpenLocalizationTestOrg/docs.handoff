To draw a cardinal spline, create a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object and pass the address of an array of points to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawCurve%2A> method.  \n  \n### Drawing a Bell-Shaped Cardinal Spline  \n  \n-   The following example draws a bell-shaped cardinal spline that passes through five designated points. The following illustration shows the curve and five points.  \n  \n     ![Cardinal Spline](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/cardinalspline1.png \"CardinalSpline1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#21](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#21](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n  \n### Drawing a Closed Cardinal Spline  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawClosedCurve%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class to draw a closed cardinal spline. In a closed cardinal spline, the curve continues through the last point in the array and connects with the first point in the array. The following example draws a closed cardinal spline that passes through six designated points. The following illustration shows the closed spline along with the six points.  \n  \n ![Cardinal Spline](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/cardinalspline1a.png \"CardinalSpline1A\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#22](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/CS/Class1.cs#22)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#22](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/VB/Class1.vb#22)]  \n  \n### Changing the Bend of a Cardinal Spline  \n  \n-   Change the way a cardinal spline bends by passing a tension argument to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawCurve%2A> method. The following example draws three cardinal splines that pass through the same set of points. The following illustration shows the three splines along with their tension values. Note that when the tension is 0, the points are connected by straight lines.  \n  \n ![Cardinal Spline](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/cardinalspline2.png \"CardinalSpline2\")  \n
