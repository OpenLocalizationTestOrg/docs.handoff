The Game1 class is fairly simple because most of the work in done in the GamePiece and GamePieceCollection classes.  \n  \n## Creating the Code  \n The private members for the class consist of a **GamePieceCollection** object to hold the game pieces, a [GraphicsDeviceManager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphicsdevicemanager.aspx) object, and a [SpriteBatch](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.spritebatch.aspx) object used to render game pieces.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_Game1_PrivateMembers](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/game1.cs#_game1_privatemembers)]  \n  \n During game initialization, these objects are instantiated.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_Game1_ConstructorInitialize](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/game1.cs#_game1_constructorinitialize)]  \n  \n When the [LoadContent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.loadcontent.aspx) method is called, the game pieces are created and assigned to the **GamePieceCollection** object. There are two types of game pieces. The scale factor for the pieces is changed slightly so that there are some smaller and some larger pieces.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_Game1_LoadContent](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/game1.cs#_game1_loadcontent)]  \n  \n The [Update](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.update.aspx) method is called repeatedly by the XNA Framework while the game is running. The [Update](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.update.aspx) method calls the **ProcessInertia** and the **UpdateFromMouse** methods on the game piece collection. These methods are described in [Creating the GamePieceCollection Class](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/creating-the-gamepiececollection-class.md).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ManipulationXNA#_Game1_UpdateGame](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/manipulationxna/cs/game1.cs#_game1_updategame)]  \n  \n The [Draw](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.draw.aspx) method is also called repeatedly by the XNA Framework while the game is running. The [Draw](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.xna.framework.game.draw.aspx) method performs the rendering of game pieces by calling the **Draw** method of the **GamePieceCollection** object. This method is described in[Creating the GamePieceCollection Class](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/creating-the-gamepiececollection-class.md).  \n  \n
