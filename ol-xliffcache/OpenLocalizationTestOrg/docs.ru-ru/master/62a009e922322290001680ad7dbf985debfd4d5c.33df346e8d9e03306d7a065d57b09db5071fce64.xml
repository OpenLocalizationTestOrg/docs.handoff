For example, you may want to display one read-only form that summarizes the data-source data and another editable form that contains detailed information about the currently selected item in the data source. This example demonstrates this scenario.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to share a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> and its bound data across forms. In this example, the shared <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is passed to the constructor of the child form. The child form allows the user to edit the data for the currently selected item in the main form.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.BindingComplete> event for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component is handled in the example to ensure that the two forms remain synchronized.
