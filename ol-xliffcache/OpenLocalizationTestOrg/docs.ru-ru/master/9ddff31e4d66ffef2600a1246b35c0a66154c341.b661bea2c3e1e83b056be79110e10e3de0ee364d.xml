You can use the columns to display several types of information about each list item. For example, a list of files could display the file name, file type, size, and date the file was last modified. For information on populating the columns once they are created, see [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md).  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To add columns in the designer  \n  \n1.  In the **Properties** window, set the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View.Details>.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property.  \n  \n     The **ColumnHeader Collection Editor** appears.  \n  \n3.  Use the **Add** button to add new columns. You can then select the column header and set its text (the caption of the column), text alignment, and width.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ListView Control Overview](listview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Add and Remove Items with the Windows Forms ListView Control](how-to-add-and-remove-items-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)\n- [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)\n- [How to: Display Icons for the Windows Forms ListView Control](how-to-display-icons-for-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)\n- [How to: Add Custom Information to a TreeView or ListView Control (Windows Forms)](add-custom-information-to-a-treeview-or-listview-control-wf.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,303],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ListView control [Windows Forms], adding column headers\"\n  - \"columns [Windows Forms], adding to ListView controls\"\nms.assetid: 5b1a8b4d-587e-479a-95c1-f9b90884f13a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,76]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[310,386],"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control can display multiple columns for each list item when in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Details<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> view.","pos":[387,527],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control can display multiple columns for each list item when in the **Details** view."},{"content":"You can use the columns to display several types of information about each list item.","pos":[528,613]},{"content":"For example, a list of files could display the file name, file type, size, and date the file was last modified.","pos":[614,725]},{"content":"For information on populating the columns once they are created, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)</ept>.","pos":[726,952],"source":" For information on populating the columns once they are created, see [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[959,1096],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Forms application project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1097,1357],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1365,1710],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
