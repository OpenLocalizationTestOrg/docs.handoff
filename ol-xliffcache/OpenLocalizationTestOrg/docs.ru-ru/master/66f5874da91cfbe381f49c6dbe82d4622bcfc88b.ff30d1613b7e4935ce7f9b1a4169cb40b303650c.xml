When putting a set of nodes into an unordered collection, the set is called a NamedNodeMap by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); you can retrieve the data by name or index in this type of collection. Putting a set of nodes in an ordered collection is called a NodeList by the W3C, and the data can be retrieved by a zero-based index. NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists are described by the W3C. The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the **XmlNamedNodeMap**, and the NodeList is implemented by the **XmlNodeList**.  \n  \n For information on the unordered collection, see [Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md). For information on the ordered collection, see [Ordered Node Retrieval by Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,199],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nms.assetid: 025954b8-7aa8-47c5-a1c1-f81064fb4d65\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"","nodes":[{"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","nodes":[{"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[206,253],"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","linkify":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","nodes":[{"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"You can retrieve a set of nodes and put it in an ordered or unordered collection.","pos":[254,335]},{"content":"When putting a set of nodes into an unordered collection, the set is called a NamedNodeMap by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); you can retrieve the data by name or index in this type of collection.","pos":[336,537]},{"content":"Putting a set of nodes in an ordered collection is called a NodeList by the W3C, and the data can be retrieved by a zero-based index.","pos":[538,671]},{"content":"NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists are described by the W3C.","pos":[672,725]},{"content":"The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>XmlNamedNodeMap<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and the NodeList is implemented by the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>XmlNodeList<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[726,882],"source":" The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the **XmlNamedNodeMap**, and the NodeList is implemented by the **XmlNodeList**."},{"content":"For information on the unordered collection, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md)</ept>.","pos":[889,1063],"source":"For information on the unordered collection, see [Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md)."},{"content":"For information on the ordered collection, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Ordered Node Retrieval by Index<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md)</ept>.","pos":[1064,1216],"source":" For information on the ordered collection, see [Ordered Node Retrieval by Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md)."},{"pos":[1225,1233],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1237,1339],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Document Object Model (DOM)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)</ept>","source":"[XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)"}]}
