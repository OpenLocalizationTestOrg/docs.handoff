All bindings are constructed from an ordered set of binding elements. Custom bindings can be built from a set of system-provided binding elements or can include user-defined custom binding elements. You can use custom binding elements, for example, to enable the use of new transports or encoders at a service endpoint. For working examples, see [Custom Binding Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/657e8143-beb0-472d-9cfe-ed1a19c2ab08). [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][\\<customBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/custombinding.md).  \n  \n## Construction of a Custom Binding  \n A custom binding is constructed using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding.%23ctor%2A> constructor from a collection of binding elements that are \"stacked\" in a specific order:  \n  \n-   At the top is an optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransactionFlowBindingElement> class that allows flowing transactions.  \n  \n-   Next is an optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ReliableSessionBindingElement> class that provides a session and ordering mechanisms as defined in the WS-ReliableMessaging specification. A session can cross SOAP and transport intermediaries.  \n  \n-   Next is an optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class that provides security features such as authorization, authentication, protection, and confidentiality.  \n  \n-   Next is an optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CompositeDuplexBindingElement> class that provides the ability to have two way duplex communication with a transport protocol that does not support duplex communication natively, such as HTTP.  \n  \n-   Next is an optional <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.OneWayBindingElement>) class that provides one-way communication.  \n  \n-   Next is an optional stream security binding element which can be one of the following.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SslStreamSecurityBindingElement>  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WindowsStreamSecurityBindingElement>  \n  \n-   Next is a required message encoding binding element. You can use your own message encoder or one of the three message encoding bindings:  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TextMessageEncodingBindingElement>  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement>  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MtomMessageEncodingBindingElement>  \n  \n At the bottom is a required transport element. You can use your own transport or one of the following transport binding elements [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TcpTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.NamedPipeTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBindingElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionOrientedTransportBindingElement>  \n  \n The following table summarizes the options for each layer.  \n  \n|Layer|Options|Required|  \n|-----------|-------------|--------------|  \n|Transactions|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransactionFlowBindingElement>|No|  \n|Reliability|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ReliableSessionBindingElement>|No|  \n|Security|<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement>|No|  \n|Encoding|Text, binary, Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), custom|Yes|  \n|Transport|TCP, HTTP, HTTPS, named pipes (also known as IPC), Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Message Queuing (also known as MSMQ), Custom|Yes|  \n  \n In addition, you can define your own binding elements and insert them between any of the preceding defined layers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Endpoint Creation
