Set to `false` to step over the function.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The step completes when the common language runtime performs the next managed instruction in this stepper's frame. If `Step` is called on a stepper, which is not in managed code, the step will complete when the next managed code instruction is executed by the thread.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,474],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  - \"ICorDebugStepper.Step\"\napi_location: \n  - \"mscordbi.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"ICorDebugStepper::Step\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Step method, ICorDebugStepper interface [.NET Framework debugging]\"\n  - \"ICorDebugStepper::Step method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\nms.assetid: 38c1940b-ada1-40ba-8295-4c0833744e1e\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[481,510],"content":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","linkify":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugStepper::Step Method","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Causes this ICorDebugStepper to single-step through its containing thread, and optionally, to continue single-stepping through functions that are called within the thread.","pos":[511,682]},{"pos":[691,697],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[769,779],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] Set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> to step into a function that is called within the thread.","pos":[796,872],"source":"[in] Set to `true` to step into a function that is called within the thread."},{"content":"Set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`false`</ph> to step over the function.","pos":[873,914],"source":" Set to `false` to step over the function."},{"pos":[923,930],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The step completes when the common language runtime performs the next managed instruction in this stepper's frame.","pos":[934,1048]},{"content":"If <ph id=\"ph1\">`Step`</ph> is called on a stepper, which is not in managed code, the step will complete when the next managed code instruction is executed by the thread.","pos":[1049,1201],"source":" If `Step` is called on a stepper, which is not in managed code, the step will complete when the next managed code instruction is executed by the thread."},{"pos":[1210,1222],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[1226,1330],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[1337,1373],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h","source":"**Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h"},{"pos":[1380,1405],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorGuids.lib","source":"**Library:** CorGuids.lib"},{"pos":[1412,1520],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]</ph>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]"}]}
