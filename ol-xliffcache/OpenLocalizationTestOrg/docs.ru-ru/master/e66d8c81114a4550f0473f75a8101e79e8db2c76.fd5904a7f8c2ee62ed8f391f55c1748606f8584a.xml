The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property sets the background color for controls that are contained in the panel, such as labels and radio buttons. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is not set, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> selection will fill all of the panel. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is set, the image will be displayed behind the controls that are contained in the panel.  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form that contains a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control. For information about how to set up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To set the background in the Windows Forms Designer  \n  \n1.
