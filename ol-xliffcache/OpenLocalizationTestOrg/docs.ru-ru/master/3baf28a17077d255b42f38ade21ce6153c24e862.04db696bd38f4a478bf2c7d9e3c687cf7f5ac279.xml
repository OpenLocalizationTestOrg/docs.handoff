It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to the `Object` variable and then try to access the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.NameTable%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property, the runtime throws a <xref:System.MemberAccessException> because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class does not expose a `NameTable` property.  \n  \n If you declare the variable to be of a specific type, the compiler can perform *early binding* at compile time. This results in improved performance, controlled access to the members of the specific type, and better readability of your code.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
