The extensive pattern-matching notation of regular expressions enables you to quickly parse large amounts of text to find specific character patterns; to validate text to ensure that it matches a predefined pattern (such as an email address); to extract, edit, replace, or delete text substrings; and to add the extracted strings to a collection in order to generate a report. For many applications that deal with strings or that parse large blocks of text, regular expressions are an indispensable tool.  \n  \n## How Regular Expressions Work  \n The centerpiece of text processing with regular expressions is the regular expression engine, which is represented by the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex?displayProperty=nameWithType> object in .NET. At a minimum, processing text using regular expressions requires that the regular expression engine be provided with the following two items of information:  \n  \n-   The regular expression pattern to identify in the text.  \n  \n     In .NET, regular expression patterns are defined by a special syntax or language, which is compatible with Perl 5 regular expressions and adds some additional features such as right-to-left matching. For more information, see [Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference.md).  \n  \n-   The text to parse for the regular expression pattern.  \n  \n The methods of the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex> class let you perform the following operations:  \n  \n-   Determine whether the regular expression pattern occurs in the input text by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For an example that uses the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A> method for validating text, see [How to: Verify that Strings Are in Valid Email Format](../../../docs/standard/base-types/how-to-verify-that-strings-are-in-valid-email-format.md).  \n  \n-   Retrieve one or all occurrences of text that matches the regular expression pattern by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. The former method returns a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match?displayProperty=nameWithType> object that provides information about the matching text. The latter returns a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> object that contains one <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match?displayProperty=nameWithType> object for each match found in the parsed text.  \n  \n-   Replace text that matches the regular expression pattern by calling the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. For examples that use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A> method to change date formats and remove invalid characters from a string, see [How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String](../../../docs/standard/base-types/how-to-strip-invalid-characters-from-a-string.md) and [Example: Changing Date Formats](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expression-example-changing-date-formats.md).  \n  \n For an overview of the regular expression object model, see [The Regular Expression Object Model](../../../docs/standard/base-types/the-regular-expression-object-model.md).  \n  \n For more information about the regular expression language, see [Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference.md) or download and print one of these brochures:  \n  \n [Quick Reference in Word (.docx) format](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/4/D240EBF6-A9BA-4E4F-A63F-AEB6DA0B921C/Regular%20expressions%20quick%20reference.docx)  \n [Quick Reference in PDF (.pdf) format](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/2/4/D240EBF6-A9BA-4E4F-A63F-AEB6DA0B921C/Regular%20expressions%20quick%20reference.pdf)  \n  \n## Regular Expression Examples  \n The <xref:System.String> class includes a number of string search and replacement methods that you can use when you want to locate literal strings in a larger string. Regular expressions are most useful either when you want to locate one of several substrings in a larger string, or when you want to identify patterns in a string, as the following examples illustrate.  \n  \n### Example 1: Replacing Substrings  \n Assume that a mailing list contains names that sometimes include a title (Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms.) along with a first and last name. If you do not want to include the titles when you generate envelope labels from the list, you can use a regular expression to remove the titles, as the following example illustrates.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example1.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example1.vb#2)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern`(Mr\\.? |Mrs\\.? |Miss |Ms\\.? )` matches any occurrence of \"Mr \", \"Mr. \", \"Mrs \", \"Mrs. \", \"Miss \", \"Ms or \"Ms. \". The call to the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method replaces the matched string with <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType>; in other words, it removes it from the original string.  \n  \n### Example 2: Identifying Duplicated Words  \n Accidentally duplicating words is a common error that writers make. A regular expression can be used to identify duplicated words, as the following example shows.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example2.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example2.vb#3)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern `\\b(\\w+?)\\s\\1\\b` can be interpreted as follows:  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|`\\b`|Start at a word boundary.|  \n|(\\w+?)|Match one or more word characters, but as few characters as possible. Together, they form a group that can be referred to as `\\1`.|  \n|`\\s`|Match a white-space character.|  \n|`\\1`|Match the substring that is equal to the group named `\\1`.|  \n|`\\b`|Match a word boundary.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method is called with regular expression options set to <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions.IgnoreCase?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Therefore, the match operation is case-insensitive, and the example identifies the substring \"This this\" as a duplication.  \n  \n Note that the input string includes the substring \"this? This\". However, because of the intervening punctuation mark, it is not identified as a duplication.  \n  \n### Example 3: Dynamically Building a Culture-Sensitive Regular Expression  \n The following example illustrates the power of regular expressions combined with the flexibility offered by .NET's globalization features. It uses the <xref:System.Globalization.NumberFormatInfo> object to determine the format of currency values in the system's current culture. It then uses that information to dynamically construct a regular expression that extracts currency values from the text. For each match, it extracts the subgroup that contains the numeric string only, converts it to a <xref:System.Decimal> value, and calculates a running total.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Regex#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/cs/example.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Regex#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.regex/vb/example.vb#1)]  \n  \n On a computer whose current culture is English - United States (en-US), the example dynamically builds the regular expression `\\$\\s*[-+]?([0-9]{0,3}(,[0-9]{3})*(\\.[0-9]+)?)`. This regular expression pattern can be interpreted as follows:  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|`\\$`|Look for a single occurrence of the dollar symbol ($) in the input string. The regular expression pattern string includes a backslash to indicate that the dollar symbol is to be interpreted literally rather than as a regular expression anchor. (The $ symbol alone would indicate that the regular expression engine should try to begin its match at the end of a string.) To ensure that the current culture's currency symbol is not misinterpreted as a regular expression symbol, the example calls the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Escape%2A> method to escape the character.|  \n|`\\s*`|Look for zero or more occurrences of a white-space character.|  \n|`[-+]?`|Look for zero or one occurrence of either a positive sign or a negative sign.|  \n|`([0-9]{0,3}(,[0-9]{3})*(\\.[0-9]+)?)`|The outer parentheses around this expression define it as a capturing group or a subexpression. If a match is found, information about this part of the matching string can be retrieved from the second <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Group> object in the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.GroupCollection> object returned by the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match.Groups%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. (The first element in the collection represents the entire match.)|  \n|`[0-9]{0,3}`|Look for zero to three occurrences of the decimal digits 0 through 9.|  \n|`(,[0-9]{3})*`|Look for zero or more occurrences of a group separator followed by three decimal digits.|  \n|`\\.`|Look for a single occurrence of the decimal separator.|  \n|`[0-9]+`|Look for one or more decimal digits.|  \n|`(\\.[0-9]+)?`|Look for zero or one occurrence of the decimal separator followed by at least one decimal digit.|  \n  \n If each of these subpatterns is found in the input string, the match succeeds, and a <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Match> object that contains information about the match is added to the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> object.  \n  \n##
