These tasks include binding the control to a data source, modifying the columns used to display data, and adjusting the appearance and basic behavior of the control.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Add and Remove Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-and-remove-columns-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Add Columns** and **Edit Columns** dialog boxes to populate and modify the columns collection.  \n  \n [How to: Bind Data to the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/bind-data-to-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Choose Data Source** option on the control's smart tag to connect to data.  \n  \n [How to: Change the Order of Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the

types.  \n  \n [How to: Enable Column Reordering in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/enable-column-reordering-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the control's smart tag to enable users to rearrange columns.  \n  \n [How to: Freeze Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/freeze-columns-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Edit Columns** dialog box to prevent specific columns from scrolling.  \n  \n [How to: Hide Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/hide-columns-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Edit Columns** dialog box to hide specific columns.  \n  \n [How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/make-columns-read-only-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **Edit Columns** dialog box to prevent users from editing values in specific columns.  \n  \n [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the control's smart tag to prevent users from

Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/set-alternating-row-styles-for-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to use the **CellStyle Builder** dialog box to create a ledger-like appearance in the control.  \n  \n [How to: Set Default Cell Styles and Data Formats for the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/default-cell-styles-datagridview.md)  \n Describes how to use the **CellStyle Builder** dialog box to set up the basic appearance and
