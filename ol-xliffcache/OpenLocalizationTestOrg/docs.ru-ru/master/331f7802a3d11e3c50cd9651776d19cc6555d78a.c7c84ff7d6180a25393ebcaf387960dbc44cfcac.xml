The sample also includes a basic console application that uses the custom activity in a workflow and shows how to discover and resume bookmarks associated with a running workflow instance. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] bookmarks, see [Bookmarks](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/bookmarks.md).  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open the Bookmarks.sln sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  To run the sample, press CTRLl + F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
