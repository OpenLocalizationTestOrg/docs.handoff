The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component makes this straightforward by providing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.AddingNew> event, which is typically raised when the bound control needs to create a new item. Your event handler can provide whatever custom behavior is required (for example, calling a method on a Web service or getting a new object from a class factory).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When an item is added by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.AddingNew> event, the addition cannot be canceled.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a class factory by using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. When the user clicks the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's new row, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.AddingNew> event is raised. The event handler creates a new `DemoCustomer` object, which is assigned to the <xref:System.ComponentModel.AddingNewEventArgs.NewObject%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property. This causes the new `DemoCustomer` object to be added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component's list and to be displayed in the new row of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew/CPP/form1.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.AddingNew/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
