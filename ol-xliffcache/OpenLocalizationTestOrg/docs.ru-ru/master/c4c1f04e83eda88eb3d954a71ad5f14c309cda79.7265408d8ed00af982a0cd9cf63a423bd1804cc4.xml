When compiling Visual Basic code, you need to supply appropriate `Imports` statements.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code contains the `Imports` statements that the Visual Basic examples require to build and run. Not all `Imports` statements are required for every example.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.Diagnostics  \nImports System.Collections  \nImports System.Collections.Generic  \nImports System.Collections.Specialized  \nImports System.Text  \nImports System.Linq  \nImports System.Xml  \nImports System.Xml.Linq  \nImports System.Xml.Schema  \nImports System.Xml.XPath  \nImports System.Xml.Xsl  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Threading  \nImports System.Reflection  \nImports System.IO.Packaging  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to XML Programming Overview (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,131],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 565bca7a-ac8b-497f-8d8d-3323b3d7799e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,49]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[138,187],"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Build LINQ to XML Examples (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"The various snippets and examples in this documentation use classes and types from a variety of namespaces.","pos":[188,295]},{"content":"When compiling Visual Basic code, you need to supply appropriate <ph id=\"ph1\">`Imports`</ph> statements.","pos":[296,382],"source":" When compiling Visual Basic code, you need to supply appropriate `Imports` statements."},{"pos":[391,398],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code contains the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Imports`</ph> statements that the Visual Basic examples require to build and run.","pos":[402,511],"source":"The following code contains the `Imports` statements that the Visual Basic examples require to build and run."},{"content":"Not all <ph id=\"ph1\">`Imports`</ph> statements are required for every example.","pos":[512,572],"source":" Not all `Imports` statements are required for every example."},{"pos":[1027,1035],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1039,1182],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ to XML Programming Overview (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ to XML Programming Overview (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml-programming-overview.md)"}]}
