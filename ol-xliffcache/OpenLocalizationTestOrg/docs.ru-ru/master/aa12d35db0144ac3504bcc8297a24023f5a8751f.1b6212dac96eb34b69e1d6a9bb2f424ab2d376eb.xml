For example, in the following code, `Prop1` is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for `Prop2`.  \n  \n```vb  \nModule M2  \n  \n    Sub ExpressionExample(Of T)(ByVal x As Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of T)))  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        ' The following line causes the error.  \n        ' ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = 2, .Prop2 = .Prop1})  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36548  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Assign the initial value for `Prop1` to a local variable. Assign that variable to both `Prop1` and `Prop2`, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Sub Main()  \n  \n        Dim temp = 2  \n        ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = temp, .Prop2 = temp})  \n  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Anonymous Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)   \n [Expression Trees](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb1d3ed8-d5b0-4211-a71f-dd271529294b)   \n [How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1e37e0cc-eef3-48bb-8b69-3adabf322735)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,157],"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,145]}]},{"pos":[695,823],"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","linkify":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","pos":[0,128]}]},{"content":"The compiler does not accept conversion of an anonymous to an expression tree when one property of the anonymous type is used to initialize another property of the anonymous type.","pos":[824,1003]},{"content":"For example, in the following code, <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for <ph id=\"ph2\">`Prop2`</ph>.","pos":[1004,1134],"source":" For example, in the following code, `Prop1` is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for `Prop2`."},{"pos":[1451,1472],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36548","source":"**Error ID:** BC36548"},{"pos":[1481,1502],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Assign the initial value for <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> to a local variable.","pos":[1512,1569],"source":"Assign the initial value for `Prop1` to a local variable."},{"content":"Assign that variable to both <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Prop2`</ph>, as shown in the following code.","pos":[1570,1651],"source":" Assign that variable to both `Prop1` and `Prop2`, as shown in the following code."},{"pos":[1823,1831],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Anonymous Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1835,1951],"source":"[Anonymous Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Expression Trees<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb1d3ed8-d5b0-4211-a71f-dd271529294b)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1954,2046],"source":" [Expression Trees](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb1d3ed8-d5b0-4211-a71f-dd271529294b) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1e37e0cc-eef3-48bb-8b69-3adabf322735)</ept>","pos":[2049,2177],"source":" [How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1e37e0cc-eef3-48bb-8b69-3adabf322735)"}]}
