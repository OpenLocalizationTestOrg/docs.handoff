This specification contains detailed information about all aspects of the language, including many points that the documentation for Visual C# doesn't cover.\n\nYou can download version 5.0 of this specification from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=7029). If you've installed Visual Studio 2015, you can also find the specification on your computer in the Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC#/Specifications/1033 folder. If you have another version of Visual Studio installed or if you installed Visual Studio in a language other than English, change the path as appropriate.\n\nVersion 6.0 of the specification is not currently available, but an unofficial draft exists in [the dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md).\n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"C# Language Specification | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"C# Language Specification | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[655,680],"content":"C# Language Specification","linkify":"C# Language Specification","nodes":[{"content":"C# Language Specification","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The C# Language Specification is the definitive source for C# syntax and usage.","pos":[681,760]},{"content":"This specification contains detailed information about all aspects of the language, including many points that the documentation for Visual C# doesn't cover.","pos":[761,918]},{"content":"You can download version 5.0 of this specification from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Microsoft Download Center<ept id=\"p1\">](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=7029)</ept>.","pos":[920,1064],"source":"You can download version 5.0 of this specification from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=7029)."},{"content":"If you've installed Visual Studio 2015, you can also find the specification on your computer in the Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC#/Specifications/1033 folder.","pos":[1065,1245]},{"content":"If you have another version of Visual Studio installed or if you installed Visual Studio in a language other than English, change the path as appropriate.","pos":[1246,1400]},{"pos":[1402,1604],"content":"Version 6.0 of the specification is not currently available, but an unofficial draft exists in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>the dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository<ept id=\"p1\">](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md)</ept>.","source":"Version 6.0 of the specification is not currently available, but an unofficial draft exists in [the dotnet/csharplang GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/spec/README.md)."},{"pos":[1611,1619],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1623,1680],"source":"[C# Reference](../../csharp/language-reference/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1683,1747],"source":" [C# Programming Guide](../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"}]}
