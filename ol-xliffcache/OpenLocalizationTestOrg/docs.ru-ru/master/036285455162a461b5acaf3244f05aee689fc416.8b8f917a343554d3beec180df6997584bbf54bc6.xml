Variables represent the storage of data and arguments represent the flow of data into and out of an activity. Arguments are bound (assigned a value) using expressions that may reference variables.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Variables and Arguments](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/variables-and-arguments.md).  \n Describes the concepts of variables and arguments and how they are used.  \n  \n [Expressions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/expressions.md)  \n Describes expressions and how they are used in workflow development.  \n  \n [C# Expressions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md)  \n Describes C# expressions in workflows, introduced with [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)].  \n  \n [Properties vs. Arguments](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/properties-vs-arguments.md)  \n Describes how to select which type to use for activity input.  \n  \n [Exposing data with CacheMetadata](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/exposing-data-with-cachemetadata.md)  \n Describes how to expose a custom set of metadata about an executing activity's members.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[390,428],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model","linkify":"Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"The Windows Workflow Foundation data model is composed of three concepts: variables, arguments, and expressions.","pos":[429,541]},{"content":"Variables represent the storage of data and arguments represent the flow of data into and out of an activity.","pos":[542,651]},{"content":"Arguments are bound (assigned a value) using expressions that may reference variables.","pos":[652,738]},{"pos":[747,762],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Variables and Arguments<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/variables-and-arguments.md)</ept>.","pos":[766,872],"source":"[Variables and Arguments](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/variables-and-arguments.md)."},{"content":"Describes the concepts of variables and arguments and how they are used.","pos":[876,948]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/expressions.md)</ept>","pos":[955,1036],"source":"[Expressions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/expressions.md)"},{"content":"Describes expressions and how they are used in workflow development.","pos":[1040,1108]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md)</ept>","pos":[1115,1206],"source":"[C# Expressions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/csharp-expressions.md)"},{"content":"Describes C# expressions in workflows, introduced with <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[1210,1318],"source":" Describes C# expressions in workflows, introduced with [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Properties vs. Arguments<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/properties-vs-arguments.md)</ept>","pos":[1325,1431],"source":"[Properties vs. Arguments](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/properties-vs-arguments.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to select which type to use for activity input.","pos":[1435,1496]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Exposing data with CacheMetadata<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/exposing-data-with-cachemetadata.md)</ept>","pos":[1503,1626],"source":"[Exposing data with CacheMetadata](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/exposing-data-with-cachemetadata.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to expose a custom set of metadata about an executing activity's members.","pos":[1630,1717]}]}
