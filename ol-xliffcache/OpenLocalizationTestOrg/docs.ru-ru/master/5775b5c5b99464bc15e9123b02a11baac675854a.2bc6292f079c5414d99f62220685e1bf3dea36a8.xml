Provides links to feature documentation for C#, Visual Basic and Visual C++, and to supporting technologies such as Reflection.  \n  \n [Numerics](../../docs/standard/numerics.md)  \n Describes the numeric types in the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [Events](../../docs/standard/events/index.md)  \n Provides an overview of the event model in the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [Exceptions](../../docs/standard/exceptions/index.md)  \n Describes error handling provided by the .NET Framework and the fundamentals of handling exceptions.  \n  \n [File and Stream I-O](../../docs/standard/io/index.md)  \n Explains how you can perform synchronous and asynchronous file and data stream access and how to use to isolated storage.  \n  \n [Dates, Times, and Time Zones](../../docs/standard/datetime/index.md)  \n Describes how to work with time zones and time zone conversions in time zone-aware applications.  \n  \n [Application Domains and Assemblies](../../docs/framework/app-domains/index.md)  \n Describes how to create and work with assemblies and application domains.  \n  \n [Serialization](../../docs/framework/serialization/index.md)  \n Discusses the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported.  \n  \n [Resources in Desktop Apps](../../docs/framework/resources/index.md)  \n Describes the .NET Framework support for creating and storing resources. This section also describes support for localized resources and the satellite assembly resource model for packaging and deploying those localized resources.  \n  \n [Globalization and Localization](../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/index.md)  \n Provides information to help you design and develop world-ready applications.  \n  \n Accessibility  \n Provides information about Microsoft UI Automation, which is an accessibility framework that addresses the needs of assistive technology products and automated test frameworks by providing programmatic access to information about the user interface (UI).  \n  \n [Attributes](../../docs/standard/attributes/index.md)  \n Describes how you can use attributes to customize metadata.  \n  \n [64-bit Applications](../../docs/framework/64-bit-apps.md)  \n Discusses issues relevant to developing applications that will run on a Windows 64-bit operating system.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Development Guide](../../docs/framework/development-guide.md)  \n Provides a guide to all key technology areas and tasks for application development, including creating, configuring, debugging, securing, and deploying your application, and information about dynamic programming, interoperability, extensibility, memory management, and threading.  \n  \n [Security](../../docs/standard/security/index.md)  \n Provides information about the classes and services in the common language runtime and the .NET Framework that facilitate secure application development.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":".NET Framework Application Essentials | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Application
