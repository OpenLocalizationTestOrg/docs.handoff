clocks are created and distributed for you automatically.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to create an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> and apply it to two similar properties.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[timingbehaviors_procedural_snip#GraphicsMMCreateAnimationClockWholeClass](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_procedural_snip/CSharp/AnimationClockExample.cs#graphicsmmcreateanimationclockwholeclass)]\n [!code-vb[timingbehaviors_procedural_snip#GraphicsMMCreateAnimationClockWholeClass](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_procedural_snip/visualbasic/animationclockexample.vb#graphicsmmcreateanimationclockwholeclass)]  \n  \n For an example showing how to interactively control a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock> after it starts, see [Interactively Control a Clock](how-to-interactively-control-a-clock.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard](how-to-animate-a-property-by-using-a-storyboard.md)\n- [Animate a Property Without Using a Storyboard](how-to-animate-a-property-without-using-a-storyboard.md)\n- [Property Animation Techniques Overview](property-animation-techniques-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,283],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"animation [WPF], properties [WPF], with AnimationClocks\"\n  - \"AnimationClocks [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: e6542021-714c-4675-9567-04f1c7380834","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[290,343],"content":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","linkify":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate a Property by Using an AnimationClock","pos":[0,53]}]},{"pos":[344,448],"content":"This example shows how to use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock&gt;</ph> objects to animate a property.","source":"This example shows how to use <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Clock> objects to animate a property."},{"content":"There are three ways to animate a dependency property:","pos":[455,509]},{"pos":[519,681],"content":"Create an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline&gt;</ph> and associate it with that property by using a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard&gt;</ph>.","source":"Create an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline> and associate it with that property by using a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>."},{"pos":[691,877],"content":"Use the object's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A&gt;</ph> method to apply a single <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline&gt;</ph> to a target property.","source":"Use the object's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method to apply a single <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline> to a target property."},{"pos":[887,1041],"content":"Create an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock&gt;</ph> from an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline&gt;</ph> and apply it to a property.","source":"Create an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationClock> from an <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.AnimationTimeline> and apply it to a property."},{"pos":[1048,1552],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard&gt;</ph> objects and the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A&gt;</ph> method enable you to animate properties without directly creating and distributing clocks (for examples, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-animate-a-property-by-using-a-storyboard.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Animate a Property Without Using a Storyboard<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-animate-a-property-without-using-a-storyboard.md)</ept>);
