The <xref:System.Data.DataRowState> is then set to **Modified**, and the changes are accepted or rejected using the <xref:System.Data.DataRow.AcceptChanges%2A> or <xref:System.Data.DataRow.RejectChanges%2A> methods of the **DataRow**. The **DataRow** also provides three methods that you can use to suspend the state of the row while you are editing it. These methods are <xref:System.Data.DataRow.BeginEdit%2A>, <xref:System.Data.DataRow.EndEdit%2A>, and <xref:System.Data.DataRow.CancelEdit%2A>.  \n  \n When you modify column values in a **DataRow** directly, the **DataRow** manages the column values using the **Current**, **Default**, and **Original** row versions. In addition to these row versions, the **BeginEdit**, **EndEdit**, and **CancelEdit** methods use a fourth row version: **Proposed**. For more information about row versions, see [Row States and Row Versions](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/row-states-and-row-versions.md).  \n  \n The **Proposed** row version exists during an edit operation that begins by calling **BeginEdit** and that ends either by using **EndEdit** or **CancelEdit,** or by calling **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges**.  \n  \n During the edit operation, you can apply validation logic to individual columns by evaluating the **ProposedValue** in the **ColumnChanged** event of the **DataTable**. The **ColumnChanged** event holds **DataColumnChangeEventArgs** that keep a reference to the column that is changing and to the **ProposedValue**. After you evaluate the proposed value, you can either modify it or cancel the edit. When the edit is ended, the row moves out of the **Proposed** state.  \n  \n You can confirm edits by calling **EndEdit**, or you can cancel them by calling **CancelEdit**. Note that while **EndEdit** does confirm your edits, the **DataSet** does not actually accept the changes until **AcceptChanges** is called. Note also that if you call **AcceptChanges** before you have ended the edit with **EndEdit** or **CancelEdit**, the edit is ended and the **Proposed** row values are accepted for both the **Current** and **Original** row versions. In the same manner, calling **RejectChanges** ends the edit and discards the **Current** and **Proposed** row versions. Calling **EndEdit** or **CancelEdit** after calling **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** has no effect because the edit has already ended.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates how to use **BeginEdit** with **EndEdit** and **CancelEdit**. The example also checks the **ProposedValue** in the **ColumnChanged** event and decides whether to cancel the edit.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim workTable As DataTable = New DataTable  \nworkTable.Columns.Add(\"LastName\", Type.GetType(\"System.String\"))  \n  \nAddHandler workTable.ColumnChanged, _  \n  New DataColumnChangeEventHandler(AddressOf OnColumnChanged)  \n  \nDim workRow As DataRow = workTable.NewRow()  \nworkRow(0) = \"Smith\"  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(workRow)  \n  \nworkRow.BeginEdit()  \n' Causes the ColumnChanged event to write a message and cancel the edit.  \nworkRow(0) = \"\"       \nworkRow.EndEdit()  \n  \n' Displays \"Smith, New\".  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"{0}, {1}\", workRow(0), workRow.RowState)  \n  \nPrivate Shared Sub OnColumnChanged( _  \n  sender As Object, args As DataColumnChangeEventArgs)  \n  If args.Column.ColumnName = \"LastName\" Then  \n    If args.ProposedValue.ToString() = \"\" Then  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"Last Name cannot be blank.  Edit canceled.\")  \n      args.Row.CancelEdit()  \n    End If  \n  End If  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataTable workTable  = new DataTable();  \nworkTable.Columns.Add(\"LastName\", typeof(String));  \n  \nworkTable.ColumnChanged +=   \n  new DataColumnChangeEventHandler(OnColumnChanged);  \n  \nDataRow workRow = workTable.NewRow();  \nworkRow[0] = \"Smith\";  \nworkTable.Rows.Add(workRow);  \n  \nworkRow.BeginEdit();  \n// Causes the ColumnChanged event to write a message and cancel the edit.  \nworkRow[0] = \"\";       \nworkRow.EndEdit();  \n  \n// Displays \"Smith, New\".  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"{0}, {1}\", workRow[0], workRow.RowState);    \n  \nprotected static void OnColumnChanged(  \n  Object sender, DataColumnChangeEventArgs args)  \n{  \n  if (args.Column.ColumnName == \"LastName\")  \n    if (args.ProposedValue.ToString() == \"\")  \n    {  \n      Console.WriteLine(\"Last Name cannot be blank. Edit canceled.\");  \n      args.Row.CancelEdit();  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Data.DataRow>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataTable>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataRowVersion>   \n
