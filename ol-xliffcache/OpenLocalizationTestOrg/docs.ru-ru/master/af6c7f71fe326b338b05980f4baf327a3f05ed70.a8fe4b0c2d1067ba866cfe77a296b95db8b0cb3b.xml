It does have a method that is called `WriteSomething`. Perhaps that is what the author of this source code meant to write.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs1061.cs  \npublic class TestClass1  \n{  \n    // TestClass1 has one method, called WriteSomething.  \n    public void WriteSomething(string s)  \n    {  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(s);  \n    }  \n}  \n  \npublic class TestClass2  \n{  \n    // TestClass2 has one method, called DisplaySomething.  \n    public void DisplaySomething(string s)  \n    {  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(s);  \n    }  \n}  \n  \npublic class TestTheClasses  \n{  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n        TestClass1 tc1 = new TestClass1();  \n        TestClass2 tc2 = new TestClass2();  \n        // The following call fails because TestClass1 does not have   \n        // a method called DisplaySomething.  \n        tc1.DisplaySomething(\"Hello\");      // CS1061  \n  \n        // To correct the error, change the method call to either   \n        // tc1.WriteSomething or tc2.DisplaySomething.  \n        tc1.WriteSomething(\"Hello from TestClass1\");  \n        tc2.DisplaySomething(\"Hello from TestClass2\");  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)\n- [Extension Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1061\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1061\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1061\"\nms.assetid: 10ba0509-d541-43da-acf5-eaa7987e41d4","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1061","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1061","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1061","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1061","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1061","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1061","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'type' does not contain a definition for 'member' and no extension method 'name' accepting a first argument of type 'type' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?).","pos":[194,394]},{"content":"This error occurs when you try to call a method or access a class member that does not exist.","pos":[401,494]},{"pos":[503,510],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example generates CS1061 because <ph id=\"ph1\">`TestClass1`</ph> does not have a <ph id=\"ph2\">`DisplaySomething`</ph> method.","pos":[514,616],"source":"The following example generates CS1061 because `TestClass1` does not have a `DisplaySomething` method."},{"content":"It does have a method that is called <ph id=\"ph1\">`WriteSomething`</ph>.","pos":[617,671],"source":" It does have a method that is called `WriteSomething`."},{"content":"Perhaps that is what the author of this source code meant to write.","pos":[672,739]},{"pos":[1768,1776],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1780,1865],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Classes and Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)"},{"pos":[1868,1963],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Extension Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Extension Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)"}]}
