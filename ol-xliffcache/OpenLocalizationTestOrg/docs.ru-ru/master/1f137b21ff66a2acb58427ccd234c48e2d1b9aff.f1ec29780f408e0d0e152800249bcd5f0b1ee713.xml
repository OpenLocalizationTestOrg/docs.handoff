The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`. The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#16](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-a-copy-constructor_1.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ICloneable>   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)   \n [Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)   \n [Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,84],"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[598,653],"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"C# doesn't provide a copy constructor for objects, but you can write one yourself.","pos":[654,736]},{"pos":[745,752],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Person`</ph><bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>class<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md)</ept> defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of <ph id=\"ph2\">`Person`</ph>.","pos":[756,936],"source":"In the following example, the `Person`[class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of `Person`."},{"content":"The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Person`</ph>.","pos":[937,1045],"source":" The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`."},{"content":"The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Name`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Age`</ph> properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class.","pos":[1046,1218],"source":" The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class."},{"pos":[1225,1369],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csProgGuideObjects#16<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-a-copy-constructor_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#16](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-a-copy-constructor_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[1378,1386],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ICloneable&gt;</ph>","pos":[1390,1414],"source":"<xref:System.ICloneable> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1418,1486],"source":" [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Classes and Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1489,1576],"source":" [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Constructors<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1579,1666],"source":" [Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Finalizers<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)</ept>","pos":[1669,1752],"source":" [Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)"}]}
