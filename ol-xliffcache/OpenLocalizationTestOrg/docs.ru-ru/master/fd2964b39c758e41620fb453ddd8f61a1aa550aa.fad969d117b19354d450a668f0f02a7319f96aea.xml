Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides three correlation mechanisms to help diagnose the cause of an error: activities, transfers, and propagation.  \n  \n See [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md) for a list of end-to-end tracing scenarios, and their respective activity and tracing design.  \n
