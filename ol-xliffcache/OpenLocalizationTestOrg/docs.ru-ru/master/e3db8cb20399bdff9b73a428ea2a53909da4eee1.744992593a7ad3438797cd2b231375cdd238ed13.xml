Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:  \n  \n (N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,142],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 266c3bd3-2ffc-4471-94b7-3675443be1ac","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[149,207],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second.","pos":[208,281]},{"pos":[290,301],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[305,449]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[450,472]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[482,527]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[537,604]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[614,693]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[703,791]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[801,835]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[845,954]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[964,1017]},{"pos":[1024,1193],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula:","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:"},{"content":"(N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","pos":[1200,1219]}]}
