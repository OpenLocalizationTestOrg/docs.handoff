The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to activity scheduled records.|  \n|[\\<activityStateQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/activitystatequeries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track life cycle changes of the activities that make up a workflow instance. For example, you may want to keep track of every time the \"Send E-Mail\" activity completes within a workflow instance. This query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to activity state record objects. The available states to subscribe to are specified in ActivityStates.|  \n|[\\<bookmarkResumptionQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/bookmarkresumptionqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track resumption of a bookmark within a workflow instance. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to bookmark resumption records.|  \n|[\\<cancelRequestedQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/cancelrequestedqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track requests to cancel a child activity by the parent activity. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to cancel request record objects.|  \n|[\\<customTrackingQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/customtrackingqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track events that you define in your code activities. The query is necessary for a tracking participant to subscribe to custom tracking records.|  \n|[\\<faultPropagationQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/faultpropagationqueries.md)|Represents a collection of queries that are used to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity.  This event occurs each time a FaultHandler processes a fault. You should use such query to track the handling of faults that occur within an activity. The query is necessary for a  tracking participant to subscribe to fault propagation records.|  \n|[\\<workflowInstanceQueries>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/workflowinstancequeries.md)|Represents a collection of configuration elements that track workflow instance life cycle changes such as a started or completed event.|  \n  \n### Parent Elements  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|[\\<trackingProfile>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/trackingprofile.md)|Represents a configuration section for creating a subscription to workflow tracking records in a tracking participant. A tracking profile contains tracking queries that permit a tracking participant to subscribe to workflow events that are emitted when the state of a workflow instance changes at runtime. The queries defined within the tracking profile section define the kinds of events that are returned by the subscription.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Tracking profiles contains tracking queries that permit a tracking participant to subscribe to workflow events that are emitted when the state of a particular workflow instance changes at runtime. The workflow instance being tracked is identified by this configuration element.  \n  \n Depending on your monitoring requirements you may write a profile that is very coarse, which subscribes to a small set of high-level state changes on a workflow. Conversely, you may create a very specific profile whose resulting events are rich enough to reconstruct a detailed execution flow later.  \n  \n Tracking profiles are structured as declarative subscriptions for tracking records that allow you to query the workflow runtime for specific tracking records. There are a handful of query types that allow you subscribe to different classes of tracking records. For a complete list of queries, see the child element list of this topic and [Tracking Profiles](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).  \n  \n The following example shows a tracking profile in a configuration file that allows a tracking participant to subscribe to the `Started` and `Completed` workflow events.  \n  \n```xml  \n<system.serviceModel>  \n  <tracking>    \n    <trackingProfile name=\"Sample Tracking Profile\">  \n      <workflow activityDefinitionId=\"*\">  \n         <workflowInstanceQueries>  \n            <workflowInstanceQuery>  \n            <states>  \n              <state name=\"Started\"/>  \n              <state name=\"Completed\"/>  \n            </states>  \n          </workflowInstanceQuery>  \n        </workflowInstanceQueries>  \n      </workflow>  \n    </trackingProfile>          \n   </profiles>  \n  </tracking>  \n</system.serviceModel>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
