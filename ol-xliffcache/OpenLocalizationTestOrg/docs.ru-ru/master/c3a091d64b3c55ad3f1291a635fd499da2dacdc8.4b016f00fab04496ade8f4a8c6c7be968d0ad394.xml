Code conventions are suggestions that focus not on a program's logic but on its physical structure and appearance. Following them makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Code conventions can include, among others:  \n  \n-   Standardized formats for labeling and commenting code.  \n  \n-   Guidelines for spacing, formatting, and indenting code.  \n  \n-   Naming conventions for objects, variables, and procedures.  \n  \n The following topics present a set of programming guidelines for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] programs, along with examples of good usage.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Structure of a Visual Basic Program](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/structure-of-a-visual-basic-program.md)  \n Provides an overview of the elements that make up a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program.  \n  \n [Main Procedure in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/main-procedure.md)  \n Discusses the procedure that serves as the starting point and overall control for your application.  \n  \n [References and the Imports Statement](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/references-and-the-imports-statement.md)  \n Discusses how to reference objects in other assemblies.  \n  \n [Namespaces in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/namespaces.md)  \n Describes how namespaces organize objects within assemblies.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Naming Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/naming-conventions.md)  \n Includes general guidelines for naming procedures, constants, variables, arguments, and objects.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Coding Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/coding-conventions.md)  \n Reviews the guidelines used in developing the samples in this documentation.  \n  \n [Conditional Compilation](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/conditional-compilation.md)  \n Describes how to compile particular blocks of code selectively while directing the compiler to ignore others.  \n  \n [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)  \n Shows how to divide long statements into multiple lines and combine short statements on one line.  \n  \n [How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-collapse-and-hide-sections-of-code.md)  \n Shows how to collapse and hide sections of code in the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] code editor.  \n  \n [How to: Label Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-label-statements.md)  \n Shows how to mark a line of code to identify it for use with statements such as `On Error Goto`.  \n  \n [Special Characters in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/special-characters-in-code.md)  \n Shows how and where to use non-numeric and non-alphabetic characters.  \n  \n [Comments in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/comments-in-code.md)  \n Discusses how to add descriptive comments to your code.  \n  \n [Keywords as Element Names in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/keywords-as-element-names-in-code.md)  \n Describes how to use brackets (`[]`) to delimit variable names that are also [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] keywords.  \n  \n [Me, My, MyBase, and MyClass](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md)  \n Describes various ways to refer to elements of a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Limitations](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/limitations.md)  \n Discusses the removal of known coding limits within [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Typographic and Code Conventions](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/typographic-and-code-conventions.md)  \n Provides standard coding conventions for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n [Writing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/writing-code-in-the-code-and-text-editor)  \n Describes features that make it easier for you to write and manage your code.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,82],"content":"Program Structure and Code Conventions (Visual Basic) | Microsoft
