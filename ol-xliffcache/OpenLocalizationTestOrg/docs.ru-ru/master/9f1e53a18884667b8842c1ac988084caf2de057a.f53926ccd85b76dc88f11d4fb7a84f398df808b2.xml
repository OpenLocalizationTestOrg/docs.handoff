Two child activities finish running their activity bodies successfully. When the third child activity body runs, it encounters an exception that is handled by canceling the third activity processing, after which the cancellation of the root activity is triggered. The logic in the root activity in this example is to compensate the other two child activities that completed earlier.  \n  \n```  \nTry  \n{  \n    CA   \n    {  \n        CA1   \n        {  \n        }  \n        CA2  \n        {  \n        }  \n        CA3  \n        {  \n            //Exception here  \n            // Then this will get cancelled  \n        }  \n  \n       // Cancellation for the root activity automatically gets called, which, in turn, adds some logic to revert what was done (Or can decide to actually confirm CA1 & CA2 if the user so desires).  \n    }  \n}  \nCatches {  \n// Can do more stuff...  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The second scenario demonstrates executing a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> in parallel with a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Delay>, which finishes before the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> branch. The completion condition is set to `true` once the first branch finishes, causing the other branch to be canceled.  \n  \n```  \nParallel   \n{  \n    Branch1   \n    {  \n        // Small Delay that times out (timeout1) before branch2.  \n    }  \n    Branch2   \n    {  \n        CA   \n        {  \n            CA1   \n            {  \n            }  \n            CA2   \n            {  \n            }  \n            CA3   \n            {  \n            }  \n            If (timeout1)    \n            {  \n                call Cancel CA  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)], open CompensationCancellation.sln.  \n  \n2.  Build the sample by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B or select \"Build Solution\" from the Build menu..  \n  \n3.  Run the sample by pressing F5 or select \"Start Debugging\" from the Debug menu. Alternately you may press Ctrl+F5 or select \"Start without Debugging\" from the Debug menu.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
