Apply this pattern when you implement custom controls that are used with the Windows Forms data binding engine.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ChangeNotification#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ChangeNotification/CS/Form1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ChangeNotification#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ChangeNotification/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To compile the previous code example:  \n  \n-   Paste the code into an empty code file. You must use the custom control on a Windows Form that contains a `Main` method.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Implement the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface](how-to-implement-the-inotifypropertychanged-interface.md)\n- [Change Notification in Windows Forms Data Binding](change-notification-in-windows-forms-data-binding.md)\n- [Windows Forms Data Binding](windows-forms-data-binding.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,366],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"custom controls [Windows Forms], property changes (using code)\"\n  - \"data binding [Windows Forms], custom controls\"\n  - \"PropertyNameChanged pattern [Windows Forms], applying\"\nms.assetid: aa47ddf6-5223-40c4-833f-a78992194836","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[373,418],"content":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","linkify":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply the PropertyNameChanged Pattern","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"The following code example demonstrates how to apply the <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>PropertyName<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>Changed pattern to a custom control.","pos":[419,526],"source":"The following code example demonstrates how to apply the *PropertyName*Changed pattern to a custom control."},{"content":"Apply this pattern when you implement custom controls that are used with the Windows Forms data binding engine.","pos":[527,638]},{"pos":[647,654],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[988,1006],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"To compile the previous code example:","pos":[1010,1047]},{"content":"Paste the code into an empty code file.","pos":[1057,1096]},{"content":"You must use the custom control on a Windows Form that contains a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method.","pos":[1097,1177],"source":" You must use the custom control on a Windows Form that contains a `Main` method."},{"pos":[1186,1194],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1198,1312],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Implement the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-implement-the-inotifypropertychanged-interface.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Implement the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface](how-to-implement-the-inotifypropertychanged-interface.md)"},{"pos":[1315,1420],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Change Notification in Windows Forms Data Binding<ept id=\"p1\">](change-notification-in-windows-forms-data-binding.md)</ept>","source":"[Change Notification in Windows Forms Data Binding](change-notification-in-windows-forms-data-binding.md)"},{"pos":[1423,1482],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Windows Forms Data Binding<ept id=\"p1\">](windows-forms-data-binding.md)</ept>","source":"[Windows Forms Data Binding](windows-forms-data-binding.md)"}]}
