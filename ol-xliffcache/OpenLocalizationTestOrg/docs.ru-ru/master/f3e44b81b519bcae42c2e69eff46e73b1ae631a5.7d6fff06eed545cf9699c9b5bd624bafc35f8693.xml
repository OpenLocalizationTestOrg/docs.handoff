A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed.  \n  \n Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code. A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In order to perform a garbage collection, the runtime must suspend all the threads except the thread performing the collection. Each thread must be brought to a safe point before it can be suspended.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Threading.Thread>\n- <xref:System.GC>\n- [Threading](../../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)\n- [Automatic Memory Management](../../../docs/standard/automatic-memory-management.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,403],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"suspending threads\"\n  - \"safe points\"\n  - \"threading [.NET Framework], suspending\"\n  - \"threading [.NET Framework], garbage collection\"\n  - \"garbage collection, threads\"\nms.assetid: e8f58e17-2714-4821-802a-f8eb3b2baa62\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","nodes":[{"pos":[0,51],"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","nodes":[{"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","pos":[0,51]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[410,461],"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","linkify":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","nodes":[{"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"When you call <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> on a thread, the system notes that a thread suspension has been requested and allows the thread to execute until it has reached a safe point before actually suspending the thread.","pos":[462,726],"source":"When you call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> on a thread, the system notes that a thread suspension has been requested and allows the thread to execute until it has reached a safe point before actually suspending the thread."},{"content":"A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed.","pos":[727,826]},{"content":"Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code.","pos":[833,963]},{"content":"A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.","pos":[964,1125]},{"pos":[1133,1343],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In order to perform a garbage collection, the runtime must suspend all the threads except the thread performing the collection.
