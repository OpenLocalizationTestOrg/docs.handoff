This topic demonstrates how to set properties on the binding elements to create a custom binding.  \n  \n For more information about how to directly create and configure binding elements without using the system-provided bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n For more information about creating and extending custom bindings, see [Extending Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/extending-bindings.md).  \n  \n In WCF all bindings are made up of *binding elements*. Each binding element derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> class. System-provided bindings such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> create and configure their own binding elements. This topic shows you how to access and change the properties of these binding elements, which are not directly exposed on the binding; specifically, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class.  \n  \n The individual binding elements are contained in a collection represented by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection> class and are added in this order: Transaction Flow, Reliable Session, Security, Composite Duplex, One-way, Stream Security, Message Encoding, and Transport. Note that not all the binding elements listed are required in every binding. User-defined binding elements can also appear in this binding element collection and must appear in the same order as previously described. For example, a user-defined transport must be the last element of the binding element collection.  \n  \n The <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class contains three binding elements:  \n  \n1.  An optional security binding element, either the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AsymmetricSecurityBindingElement> class used with the HTTP transport (message level security) or the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TransportSecurityBindingElement> class, which is used when the transport layer provides security, in which case the HTTPS transport is used.  \n  \n2.  A required message encoder binding element, either <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.TextMessageEncodingBindingElement> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MtomMessageEncodingBindingElement>.  \n  \n3.  A required transport binding element, either <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpsTransportBindingElement>.  \n  \n In this example we create an instance of the binding, generate a *custom binding* from it, examine the binding elements in the custom binding, and when we find the HTTP binding element, we set its `KeepAliveEnabled` property to `false`. The `KeepAliveEnabled` property is not exposed directly on the `BasicHttpBinding`, so we must create a custom binding to navigate down to the binding element and set this property.  \n  \n### To modify a system-provided binding  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class and set its security mode to message-level.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_ChangeStandardBinding#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_changestandardbinding/cs/program.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_ChangeStandardBinding#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_changestandardbinding/vb/program.vb#1)]  \n  \n2.  Create a custom binding from the binding and create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection> class from one of the custom binding's properties.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_ChangeStandardBinding#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_changestandardbinding/cs/program.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_ChangeStandardBinding#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_changestandardbinding/vb/program.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  Loop through the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElementCollection> class, and when you find the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement> class, set its <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement.KeepAliveEnabled%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n
