For example, the direct base class must be at least as accessible as the derived class. The following declarations cause a compiler error because the base class `BaseClass` is less accessible than `MyClass`:  \n  \n```  \nclass BaseClass {...}  \npublic class MyClass: BaseClass {...} // Error  \n```  \n  \n The following table summarizes the restrictions on declared accessibility levels.  \n  \n|Context|Remarks|  \n|-------------|-------------|  \n|[Classes](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/classes.md)|The direct base class of a class type must be at least as accessible as the class type itself.|  \n|[Interfaces](../../../csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/index.md)|The explicit base interfaces of an interface type must be at least as accessible as the interface type itself.|  \n|[Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md)|The return type and parameter types of a delegate type must be at least as accessible as the delegate type itself.|  \n|[Constants](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constants.md)|The type of a constant must be at least as accessible as the constant itself.|  \n|[Fields](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields.md)|The type of a field must be at least as accessible as the field itself.|  \n|[Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md)|The return type and parameter types of a method must be at least as accessible as the method itself.|  \n|[Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties.md)|The type of a property must be at least as accessible as the property itself.|  \n|[Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)|The type of an event must be at least as accessible as the event itself.|  \n|[Indexers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/indexers/index.md)|The type and parameter types of an indexer must be at least as accessible as the indexer itself.|  \n|[Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/operators.md)|The return type and parameter types of an operator must be at least as accessible as the operator itself.|  \n|[Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)|The parameter types of a constructor must be at least as accessible as the constructor itself.|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example contains erroneous declarations of different types.
