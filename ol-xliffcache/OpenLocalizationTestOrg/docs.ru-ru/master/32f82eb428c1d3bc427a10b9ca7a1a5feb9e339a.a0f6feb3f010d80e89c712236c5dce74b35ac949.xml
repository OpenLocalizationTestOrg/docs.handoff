When the compiler reports a syntax-related error or warning, it also outputs the line from source code. For applications that parse compiler output, it may be more convenient for the compiler to output only the text of the diagnostic.  \n  \n In the following example, `Module1` outputs an error that includes source code when compiled without `-quiet`.  \n  \n```vb  \nModule Module1  \n    Sub Main()  \n        x()  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n Output:  \n \n```console\nC:\\projects\\vb2.vb(3) : error BC30451: 'x' is not declared. It may be inaccessible due to its protection level.\n\n        x()\n        ~\n``` \n Compiled with `-quiet`, the compiler outputs only the following:  \n  \n `E:\\test\\t2.vb(3) : error BC30451: Name 'x' is not declared.`  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-quiet` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `T2.vb` and does not display code for syntax-related compiler diagnostics:  \n  \n```  \nvbc -quiet t2.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,280],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-quiet\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"-quiet\"\n  - \"quiet\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"-quiet compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/quiet compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"quiet compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: 5d77fa23-4c50-4708-8535-649912b098e8","nodes":[{"content":"-quiet","nodes":[{"pos":[0,6],"content":"-quiet","nodes":[{"content":"-quiet","pos":[0,6]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[287,293],"content":"-quiet","linkify":"-quiet","nodes":[{"content":"-quiet","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"Prevents the compiler from displaying code for syntax-related errors and warnings.","pos":[294,376]},{"pos":[385,391],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[424,431],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"By default, <ph id=\"ph1\">`-quiet`</ph> is not in effect.","pos":[435,473],"source":"By default, `-quiet` is not in effect."},{"content":"When the compiler reports a syntax-related error or warning, it also outputs the line from source code.","pos":[474,577]},{"content":"For applications that parse compiler output, it may be more convenient for the compiler to output only the text of the diagnostic.","pos":[578,708]},{"pos":[715,825],"content":"In the following example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`Module1`</ph> outputs an error that includes source code when compiled without <ph id=\"ph2\">`-quiet`</ph>.","source":"In the following example, `Module1` outputs an error that includes source code when compiled without `-quiet`."},{"content":"Output:","pos":[924,931]},{"pos":[1088,1152],"content":"Compiled with <ph id=\"ph1\">`-quiet`</ph>, the compiler outputs only the following:","source":"Compiled with `-quiet`, the compiler outputs only the following:"},{"pos":[1228,1389],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `-quiet` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-quiet`</ph> option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.","pos":[9,159],"source":"The `-quiet` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line."}]},{"pos":[1398,1405],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1409,1511],"content":"The following code compiles <ph id=\"ph1\">`T2.vb`</ph> and does not display code for syntax-related compiler diagnostics:","source":"The following code compiles `T2.vb` and does not display code for syntax-related compiler diagnostics:"},{"pos":[1554,1562],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1566,1666],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)"},{"pos":[1669,1794],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Sample Compilation Command Lines<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)</ept>","source":"[Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)"}]}
