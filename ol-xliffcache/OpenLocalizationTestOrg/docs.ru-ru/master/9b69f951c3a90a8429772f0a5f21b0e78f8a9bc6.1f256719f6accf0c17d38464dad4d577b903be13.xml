This includes using a <xref:System.String>, or by using the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>, or <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> classes. To facilitate moving between these different representations of an XML document, the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides a number of methods and properties for extracting the XML as a <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object or <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  \n  \n## Convert an XPathNavigator to a String  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.OuterXml%2A> property of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class is used to get the markup of the entire XML document or just the markup of a single node and its child nodes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.InnerXml%2A> property gets the markup of just the child nodes of a node.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to save an entire XML document contained in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object as a <xref:System.String>, as well as a single node and its child nodes.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument(\"input.xml\")  \nDim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  \n  \n' Save the entire input.xml document to a string.  \nDim xml As String = navigator.OuterXml  \n  \n' Now save the Root element and its child nodes to a string.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(XPathNodeType.Element)  \nDim root As String = navigator.OuterXml  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nXPathDocument document = new XPathDocument(\"input.xml\");  \nXPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  \n  \n// Save the entire input.xml document to a string.  \nstring xml = navigator.OuterXml;  \n  \n// Now save the Root element and its child nodes to a string.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(XPathNodeType.Element);  \nstring root = navigator.OuterXml;  \n```  \n  \n## Convert an XPathNavigator to an XmlReader  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.ReadSubtree%2A> method is used to stream the entire contents of an XML document or just a single node and its child nodes to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object.  \n  \n When the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object is created with the current node and its child nodes, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState>. When the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method is called for the first time, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> is moved to the current node of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator>. The new <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object continues to read until the end of the XML tree is reached. At this point, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.Read%2A> method returns `false` and the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object's <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader.ReadState%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Xml.ReadState>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object's position is unchanged by the creation or movement of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.ReadSubtree%2A> method is only valid when positioned on an element or root node.  \n  \n The following example shows how to get an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object containing the entire XML document in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object as well as a single node and its child nodes.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument(\"books.xml\")  \nDim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  \n  \n' Stream the entire XML document to the XmlReader.  \nDim xml As XmlReader = navigator.ReadSubtree()  \n  \nWhile xml.Read()  \n    Console.WriteLine(xml.ReadInnerXml())  \nEnd While  \n  \nxml.Close()  \n  \n' Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlReader.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"bookstore\", \"\")  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"book\", \"\")  \n  \nDim book As XmlReader = navigator.ReadSubtree()  \n  \nWhile book.Read()  \n    Console.WriteLine(book.ReadInnerXml())  \nEnd While  \n  \nbook.Close()  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nXPathDocument document = new XPathDocument(\"books.xml\");  \nXPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  \n  \n// Stream the entire XML document to the XmlReader.  \nXmlReader xml = navigator.ReadSubtree();  \n  \nwhile (xml.Read())  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(xml.ReadInnerXml());  \n}  \n  \nxml.Close();  \n  \n// Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlReader.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"bookstore\", \"\");  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"book\", \"\");  \n  \nXmlReader book = navigator.ReadSubtree();  \n  \nwhile (book.Read())  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(book.ReadInnerXml());  \n}  \n  \nbook.Close();  \n```  \n  \n The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.  \n  \n [!code-xml[XPathXMLExamples#1](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/XPathXMLExamples/XML/books.xml#1)]  \n  \n## Converting an XPathNavigator to an XmlWriter  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.WriteSubtree%2A> method is used to stream the entire contents of an XML document or just a single node and its child nodes to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object's position is unchanged by the creation of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object.  \n  \n The following example shows how to get an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> object containing the entire XML document in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object as well as a single node and its child nodes.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument(\"books.xml\")  \nDim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  \n  \n' Stream the entire XML document to the XmlWriter.  \nDim xml As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(\"newbooks.xml\")  \nnavigator.WriteSubtree(xml)  \nxml.Close()  \n  \n' Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlWriter.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"bookstore\", \"\")  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"book\", \"\")  \n  \nDim book As XmlWriter = XmlWriter.Create(\"book.xml\")  \nnavigator.WriteSubtree(book)  \nbook.Close()  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nXPathDocument document = new XPathDocument(\"books.xml\");  \nXPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  \n  \n// Stream the entire XML document to the XmlWriter.  \nXmlWriter xml = XmlWriter.Create(\"newbooks.xml\");  \nnavigator.WriteSubtree(xml);  \nxml.Close();  \n  \n// Stream the book element and its child nodes to the XmlWriter.  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"bookstore\", \"\");  \nnavigator.MoveToChild(\"book\", \"\");  \n  \nXmlWriter book = XmlWriter.Create(\"book.xml\");  \nnavigator.WriteSubtree(book);  \nbook.Close();  \n```  \n  \n The example takes the `books.xml` file found earlier in this topic as input.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>   \n <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>   \n
