Web endpoints send data by XML or JSON, there is no SOAP envelope. This topic demonstrates how to expose such an endpoint.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The only way to secure a Web endpoint is to expose it through HTTPS, using transport security. When using message-based security, security information is usually placed in SOAP headers and because the messages sent to non-SOAP endpoints contain no SOAP envelope, there is nowhere to place the security information and you must rely on transport security.  \n  \n### To create a Web endpoint  \n  \n1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attributes.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htBasicService#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/cs/service.cs#0)]\n     [!code-vb[htBasicService#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/vb/service.vb#0)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  By default, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> maps POST calls to the operation. You can, however, specify the HTTP method (for example, HEAD, PUT, or DELETE) to map to the operation by specifying a \"method=\" parameter. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> does not have a \"method=\" parameter and only maps GET calls to the service operation.  \n  \n2.  Implement the service contract.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htBasicService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/cs/service.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[htBasicService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/vb/service.vb#1)]  \n  \n### To host the service  \n  \n1.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebServiceHost> object.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htBasicService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/cs/service.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[htBasicService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/vb/service.vb#2)]  \n  \n2.

The reason for this is the listen URI of the endpoint is the same as the URI for the help page (the page that is displayed when you browse to the base address of a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service).  \n  \n     You can do one of the following actions to prevent this from happening:  \n  \n    -   Always specify a non-blank URI for a non-SOAP endpoint.  \n  \n    -   Turn off the help page. This can be done with the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htBasicService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/cs/snippets.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[htBasicService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htbasicservice/vb/snippets.vb#4)]  \n  \n3.

The URL contains the base address of the service (\"http://localhost:8000/\"), the relative address of the endpoint (\"\"), the service operation to call (\"EchoWithGet\"), and a question mark followed by a list of named parameters separated by an ampersand (&).  \n  \n### To call service operations in code  \n  \n1.
