When putting a set of nodes into an unordered collection, the set is called a NamedNodeMap by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); you can retrieve the data by name or index in this type of collection. Putting a set of nodes in an ordered collection is called a NodeList by the W3C, and the data can be retrieved by a zero-based index. NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists are described by the W3C. The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the **XmlNamedNodeMap**, and the NodeList is implemented by the **XmlNodeList**.  \n  \n For information on the unordered collection, see [Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md). For information on the ordered collection, see [Ordered Node Retrieval by Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,76],"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[421,468],"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","linkify":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","nodes":[{"content":"Node Collections in NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"You can retrieve a set of nodes and put it in an ordered or unordered collection.","pos":[469,550]},{"content":"When putting a set of nodes into an unordered collection, the set is called a NamedNodeMap by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C); you can retrieve the data by name or index in this type of collection.","pos":[551,752]},{"content":"Putting a set of nodes in an ordered collection is called a NodeList by the W3C, and the data can be retrieved by a zero-based index.","pos":[753,886]},{"content":"NamedNodeMaps and NodeLists are described by the W3C.","pos":[887,940]},{"content":"The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>XmlNamedNodeMap<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and the NodeList is implemented by the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>XmlNodeList<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[941,1097],"source":" The implementations in the Microsoft .NET Framework for the NamedNodeMap is the **XmlNamedNodeMap**, and the NodeList is implemented by the **XmlNodeList**."},{"content":"For information on the unordered collection, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md)</ept>.","pos":[1104,1278],"source":"For information on the unordered collection, see [Unordered Node Retrieval by Name or Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/unordered-node-retrieval-by-name-or-index.md)."},{"content":"For information on the ordered collection, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Ordered Node Retrieval by Index<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md)</ept>.","pos":[1279,1431],"source":" For information on the ordered collection, see [Ordered Node Retrieval by Index](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/ordered-node-retrieval-by-index.md)."},{"pos":[1440,1448],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1452,1554],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Document Object Model (DOM)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)</ept>","source":"[XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)"}]}
