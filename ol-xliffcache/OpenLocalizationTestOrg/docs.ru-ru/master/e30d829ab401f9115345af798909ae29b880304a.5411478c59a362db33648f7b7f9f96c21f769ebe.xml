It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value. Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned.  \n  \n Arrays of type <xref:System.Void> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31428  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Remove the parentheses that designate an array.  \n  \n2.  Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Void>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,100],"content":"Arrays of type &#39;System.Void&#39; are not allowed in this expression | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Arrays of type &amp;#39;System.Void&amp;#39; are not allowed in this expression | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,88],"source":"Arrays of type &#39;System.Void&#39; are not allowed in this expression | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[616,687],"content":"Arrays of type &#39;System.Void&#39; are not allowed in this expression","linkify":"Arrays of type &#39;System.Void&#39; are not allowed in this expression","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays of type &amp;#39;System.Void&amp;#39; are not allowed in this expression","pos":[0,71],"source":"Arrays of type &#39;System.Void&#39; are not allowed in this expression"}]},{"content":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration specifies an array of type <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>.","pos":[688,792],"source":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration specifies an array of type <xref:System.Void>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++.","pos":[799,937],"source":"The <xref:System.Void> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++."},{"content":"It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value.","pos":[938,1014]},{"content":"Visual Basic uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub`</ph> procedure when a value is not returned and a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Function`</ph> procedure when a value is returned.","pos":[1015,1132],"source":" Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned."},{"content":"Arrays of type <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context.","pos":[1139,1227],"source":"Arrays of type <xref:System.Void> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context."},{"pos":[1234,1255],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31428","source":"**Error ID:** BC31428"},{"pos":[1264,1285],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the parentheses that designate an array.","pos":[1295,1342]},{"content":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>, remove the reference to it altogether.","pos":[1352,1476],"source":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether."},{"pos":[1485,1493],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
