By default, only the currently visible part of the form is printed; if a user has resized the form at run time, the image may not print as intended. The following procedure shows how to print the complete client area of a scrollable form, even if the form has been resized.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n### To print the complete client area of a scrollable form  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component will be added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.Scrollable)  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, you will not be able to print with the `Scrollable` parameter.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.Print%2A>   \n [PrintForm Component](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/printform-component.md)   \n [How to: Print the Client Area of a Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-the-client-area-of-a-form.md)   \n [How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-client-and-non-client-areas-of-a-form.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,75],"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,63]}]},{"pos":[628,674],"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[675,867],"source":"The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component."},{"content":"By default, only the currently visible part of the form is printed; if a user has resized the form at run time, the image may not print as intended.","pos":[868,1016]},{"content":"The following procedure shows how to print the complete client area of a scrollable form, even if the form has been resized.","pos":[1017,1141]},{"pos":[1148,1328],"content":"The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Download Center<ept id=\"p1\">](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169)</ept>.","source":"The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169)."},{"pos":[1338,1392],"content":"To print the complete client area of a scrollable form","linkify":"To print the complete client area of a scrollable form","nodes":[{"content":"To print the complete client area of a scrollable form","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[1402,1565],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Toolbox<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, click the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Visual Basic PowerPacks<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> tab and then drag the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component onto the form.","source":"In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component will be added to the component tray.","pos":[1576,1685],"source":"The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component will be added to the component tray."},{"pos":[1695,1862],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window, set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction&gt;</ph>.","source":"In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>."},{"pos":[1872,1996],"content":"Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Click`</ph> event handler for a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Print<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept><ph id=\"ph2\">`Button`</ph>).","source":"Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`)."},{"pos":[2112,2320],"content":"[!NOTE]\nOn some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly.
