If the timestamp information is equivalent, the font file that is first in alphabetical order is returned.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,326],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Enumerate System Fonts\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"typography [WPF], enumerating system fonts\"\n  - \"fonts [WPF], enumerating\"\n  - \"system fonts [WPF], enumerating\"\n  - \"enumerating [WPF], system fonts\"\nms.assetid: 36e37791-55b9-4f01-a496-5cc10335e6a6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","nodes":[{"pos":[0,30],"content":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","pos":[0,30]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[333,363],"content":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","linkify":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Enumerate System Fonts","pos":[0,30]}]},{"pos":[367,374],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to enumerate the fonts in the system font collection.","pos":[378,463]},{"content":"The font family name of each <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily&gt;</ph> within <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Fonts.SystemFontFamilies%2A&gt;</ph> is added as an item to a combo box.","pos":[464,630],"source":" The font family name of each <xref:System.Windows.Media.FontFamily> within <xref:System.Windows.Media.Fonts.SystemFontFamilies%2A> is added as an item to a combo box."},{"content":"If multiple versions of the same font family reside in the same directory, the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> font enumeration returns the most recent version of the font.","pos":[882,1102],"source":"If multiple versions of the same font family reside in the same directory, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] font enumeration returns the most recent version of the font."},{"content":"If the version information does not provide resolution, the font with latest timestamp is returned.","pos":[1103,1202]},{"content":"If the timestamp information is equivalent, the font file that is first in alphabetical order is returned.","pos":[1203,1309]}]}
