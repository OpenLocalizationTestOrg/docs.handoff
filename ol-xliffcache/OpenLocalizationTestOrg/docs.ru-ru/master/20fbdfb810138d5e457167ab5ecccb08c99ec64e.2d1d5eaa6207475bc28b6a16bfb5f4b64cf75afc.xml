SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,53],"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[352,376],"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","linkify":"Calls Faulted Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted Per Second","pos":[377,415]},{"pos":[424,435],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls that returned faults to this operation in a second.","pos":[439,506]},{"pos":[513,681],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula.","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula."},{"content":"(N 1 - N 0 ) / ( (D 1 -D 0 ) / F)","pos":[688,721]},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[728,887],"source":"In [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages."},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[888,1086]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[1087,1173]},{"pos":[1182,1190],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1194,1347],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
