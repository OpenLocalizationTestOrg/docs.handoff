Create a new Visual Studio Console App Project. Add the code shown in the following steps in the generated Program.cs file within the main() method.  \n  \n2.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlExporter>.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_UEWsdlExporter#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/cs/program.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[S_UEWsdlExporter#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/vb/program.vb#1)]  \n  \n3.  Set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExporter.PolicyVersion%2A> property to one of the values from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion> enumeration. This sample sets the value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.PolicyVersion.Policy15%2A> which corresponds to WS-Policy 1.5.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_UEWsdlExporter#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/cs/program.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[S_UEWsdlExporter#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/vb/program.vb#2)]  \n  \n4.

Check to make sure no errors occurred during the export process and retrieve the metadata.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_UEWsdlExporter#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/cs/program.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[S_UEWsdlExporter#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/vb/program.vb#5)]  \n  \n7.  You can now use the metadata, such as write it to a file by calling the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataSet.WriteTo%28System.Xml.XmlWriter%29> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following is the full code listing for this example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[S_UEWsdlExporter#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_uewsdlexporter/cs/program.cs#0)]\n
