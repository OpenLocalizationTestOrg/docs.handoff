Service code can also be implemented directly in source code files located in the application's \\App_Code directory, or compiled into assembly deployed in \\bin. This sample does not demonstrate these techniques.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Services\\Hosting\\WebHost\\InlineCode`  \n  \n The sample demonstrates a typical service that implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The service is hosted in IIS and the service code is entirely contained in the Service.svc file. The service is host-activated and compiled on-demand by the first message sent to the service. There is no pre-compilation necessary. The service implements an `ICalculator` contract as defined in the following code:  \n  \n```csharp\n// Define a service contract.  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \n    public interface ICalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Add(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Divide(double n1, double n2);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The service implementation calculates and returns the appropriate result.  \n  \n```svc\n<%@ServiceHost language=c# Debug=\"true\" Service=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\" %>   \n```\n```csharp\n// Service class that implements the service contract.  \npublic class CalculatorService : ICalculator  \n{  \n    public double Add(double n1, double n2)  \n    {  \n        return n1 + n2;  \n    }  \n    public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  \n    {  \n        return n1 - n2;  \n    }  \n    public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  \n    {  \n        return n1 * n2;  \n    }  \n    public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  \n    {  \n        return n1 / n2;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```console  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  After the solution has been built, run setup.bat to set up the ServiceModelSamples Application in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]. The ServiceModelSamples directory should now appear as an [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] Application.  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md). For an example on how to create a client application that can call this service, see [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [AppFabric Hosting and Persistence Samples](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=193961)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Web hosted service\"\n  - \"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code Sample [Windows Communication Foundation]\"\nms.assetid: 56fe3687-a34b-4661-8e30-b33770f413fa","nodes":[{"content":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","nodes":[{"content":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[245,274],"content":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","linkify":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","nodes":[{"content":"IIS Hosting Using Inline Code","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates how to implement a service hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS), where the service code is contained in-line in a .svc file and is compiled on demand.","pos":[275,459]},{"content":"Service code can also be implemented directly in source code files located in the application's \\App_Code directory, or compiled into assembly deployed in \\bin.","pos":[460,620]},{"content":"This sample does not demonstrate these techniques.","pos":[621,671]},{"pos":[679,787],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","pos":[9,106]}]},{"pos":[795,928],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your computer.
