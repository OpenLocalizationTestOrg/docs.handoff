For example, function delegate `Del` has one parameter of type `Integer`, and functions `Conversion1`, `Conversion2`, and `Conversion3` have one parameter of different numeric types.  \n  \n```vb  \nDelegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer) As String  \n  \nFunction Conversion1(ByVal n As Integer) As String  \n    Return \"Valid\"  \nEnd Function  \n  \nFunction Conversion2(ByVal n As Long) As String  \n    Return \"Valid\"  \nEnd Function  \n  \nFunction Conversion3(ByVal n As Short) As String  \n    Return \"Not valid\"  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n Because there is a widening conversion from `Integer` to `Integer` and to `Long`, the following assignments are valid.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Valid.  \nDim funDel1 As Del = AddressOf Conversion1  \nDim funDel2 As Del = AddressOf Conversion2  \n```  \n  \n The conversion from `Integer` to `Short` is a narrowing conversion. Therefore, the following assignment is not valid.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Not valid.  \nDim funDel3 As Del = AddressOf Conversion3  \n```  \n  \n Error ID: BC36663  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the data type of the parameter in the delegate or the method so that the required widening relationship exists.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)\n- [Delegates](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)\n- [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,291],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Option Strict On does not allow narrowing in implicit type conversions between method '<methodname>' and delegate '<delegatename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
