The Vbc.rsp file—which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file—references the commonly used [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] assemblies and imports the `System` and `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespaces.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/nostdlib` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `T2.vb` without referencing the standard libraries. You must set the `_MYTYPE` conditional-compilation constant to the string \"Empty\" to remove the `My` object.  \n  \n```  \nvbc /nostdlib /define:_MYTYPE=\\\"Empty\\\" T2.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [/noconfig](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/noconfig.md)   \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)   \n [Customizing Which Objects are Available in My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/customizing-which-objects-are-available-in-my.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,53],"content":"/nostdlib (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"/nostdlib (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[675,699],"content":"/nostdlib (Visual Basic)","linkify":"/nostdlib (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"/nostdlib (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Causes the compiler not to automatically reference the standard libraries.","pos":[700,774]},{"pos":[783,789],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[825,832],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`/nostdlib`</ph> option removes the automatic reference to the System.dll assembly and prevents the compiler from reading the Vbc.rsp file.","pos":[836,974],"source":"The `/nostdlib` option removes the automatic reference to the System.dll assembly and prevents the compiler from reading the Vbc.rsp file."},{"content":"The Vbc.rsp file—which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file—references the commonly used <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)]</ph> assemblies and imports the <ph id=\"ph2\">`System`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">`Microsoft.VisualBasic`</ph> namespaces.","pos":[975,1239],"source":" The Vbc.rsp file—which is located in the same directory as the Vbc.exe file—references the commonly used [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] assemblies and imports the `System` and `Microsoft.VisualBasic` namespaces."},{"pos":[1247,1338],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assemblies are always referenced.","pos":[9,89]}]},{"pos":[1346,1510],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `/nostdlib` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment;
