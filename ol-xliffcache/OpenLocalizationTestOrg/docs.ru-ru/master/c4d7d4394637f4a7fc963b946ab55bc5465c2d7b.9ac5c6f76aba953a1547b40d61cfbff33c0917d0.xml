Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdocument-component-windows-forms.md) component to enable the user to print, and the [PrintPreviewDialog Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md) control, [PrintDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) and [PageSetupDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/pagesetupdialog-component-windows-forms.md) components to provide a familiar graphical interface to users accustomed to the Windows operating system.  \n  \n Typically, you create a new instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, set the properties that describe what to print using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings> classes, and call the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.Print%2A> method to actually print the document.  \n  \n During the course of printing from a Windows-based application, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component will show an abort print dialog box to alert users to the fact that printing is occurring and to allow the print job to be canceled.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md)  \n Explains how to use the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to print from a Windows Form.  \n  \n [How to: Capture User Input from a PrintDialog at Run Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-capture-user-input-from-a-printdialog-at-run-time.md)  \n Explains how to modify selected print options programmatically using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component.  \n  \n [How to: Choose the Printers Attached to a User's Computer in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-choose-the-printers-attached-to-user-computer-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes changing the printer to print to using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component at run time.  \n  \n [How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-print-graphics-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes sending graphics to the printer.  \n  \n [How to: Print a Multi-Page Text File in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-print-a-multi-page-text-file-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes sending text to the printer.  \n  \n [How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-complete-windows-forms-print-jobs.md)  \n Explains how to alert users to the completion of a print job.  \n  \n [How to: Print a Windows Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-print-a-windows-form.md)  \n Shows how to print a copy of the current form.  \n  \n [How to: Print in Windows Forms Using Print Preview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-print-in-windows-forms-using-print-preview.md)  \n Shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> for printing a document.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [PrintDocument Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdocument-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains usage of the
