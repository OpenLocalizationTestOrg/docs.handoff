Check the name of the member to ensure it is accurate.  \n  \n2.  Use an actual member of the class.\n\n3. If you are attempting to compile an SDK-style project (a project with a \\*.vbproj file that begins with the line `<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">`), and the error message refers to a type or member in the Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll assembly, configure your application to compile with a reference to the Visual Basic Runtime Library. By default, a subset of the library is embedded in your assembly in an SDK-style project.\n\n   For example, the following example fails to compile because the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.Conversions.ToInteger%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method cannot be found.
