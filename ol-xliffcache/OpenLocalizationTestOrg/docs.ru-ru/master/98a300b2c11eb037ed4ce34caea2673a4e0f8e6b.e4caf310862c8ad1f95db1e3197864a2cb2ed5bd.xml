Queries are executed lazily, as each subsequent item in the result is requested. When you use `foreach` to iterate the results, items are returned as accessed. To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a `foreach` loop, just call one of the following methods on the query variable:\n\n- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToList%2A>\n\n- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToArray%2A>\n\n- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToDictionary%2A>\n\n- <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ToLookup%2A>\n\n We recommend that when you store the query results, you assign the returned collection object to a new variable as shown in the following example:\n\n## Example\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#25](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-store-the-results-of-a-query-in-memory_1.cs)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,153],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Store the results of a query in memory\ndescription: How to store results.\nms.date: 11/30/2016\nms.assetid: 5b863961-1750-4cf9-9607-acea5054d15a","nodes":[{"content":"Store the results of a query in memory","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Store the results of a query in memory","nodes":[{"content":"Store the results of a query in memory","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"How to store results.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"How to store results.","nodes":[{"content":"How to store results.","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[160,198],"content":"Store the results of a query in memory","linkify":"Store the results of a query in memory","nodes":[{"content":"Store the results of a query in memory","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"A query is basically a set of instructions for how to retrieve and organize data.","pos":[200,281]},{"content":"Queries are executed lazily, as each subsequent item in the result is requested.","pos":[282,362]},{"content":"When you use <ph id=\"ph1\">`foreach`</ph> to iterate the results, items are returned as accessed.","pos":[363,441],"source":" When you use `foreach` to iterate the results, items are returned as accessed."},{"content":"To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a <ph id=\"ph1\">`foreach`</ph> loop, just call one of the following methods on the query variable:","pos":[442,581],"source":" To evaluate a query and store its results without executing a `foreach` loop, just call one of the following methods on the query variable:"},{"content":"We recommend that when you store the query results, you assign the returned collection object to a new variable as shown in the following example:","pos":[765,911]},{"pos":[916,923],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1056,1064],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1068,1112],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language Integrated Query (LINQ)<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)"}]}
