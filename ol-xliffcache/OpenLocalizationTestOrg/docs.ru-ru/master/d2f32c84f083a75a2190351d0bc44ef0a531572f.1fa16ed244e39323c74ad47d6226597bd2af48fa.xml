Because it is a constructor, `Sub New` can run only once when a class is created. It cannot be called explicitly from anywhere other than the first line of code in another constructor in either the same class or a derived class.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30363  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the `Sub New` or move it to a more appropriate place in your code.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NOT IN BUILD: Using Constructors and Destructors](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/548eebe1-86c4-4377-b2f5-447cb8be3d90)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,81],"content":"&#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;Sub New&amp;#39; cannot be declared in an interface | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,69],"source":"&#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[598,650],"content":"&#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface","linkify":"&#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;Sub New&amp;#39; cannot be declared in an interface","pos":[0,52],"source":"&#39;Sub New&#39; cannot be declared in an interface"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to declare <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub New`</ph> within an interface.","pos":[651,711],"source":"You have attempted to declare `Sub New` within an interface."},{"content":"Because it is a constructor, <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub New`</ph> can run only once when a class is created.","pos":[712,793],"source":" Because it is a constructor, `Sub New` can run only once when a class is created."},{"content":"It cannot be called explicitly from anywhere other than the first line of code in another constructor in either the same class or a derived class.","pos":[794,940]},{"pos":[947,968],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30363","source":"**Error ID:** BC30363"},{"pos":[977,998],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1008,1081],"content":"Remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub New`</ph> or move it to a more appropriate place in your code.","source":"Remove the `Sub New` or move it to a more appropriate place in your code."},{"pos":[1090,1098],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1102,1222],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Using Constructors and Destructors<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/548eebe1-86c4-4377-b2f5-447cb8be3d90)</ept>","source":"[NOT IN BUILD: Using Constructors and Destructors](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/548eebe1-86c4-4377-b2f5-447cb8be3d90)"}]}
