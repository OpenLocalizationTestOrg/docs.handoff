This public and private cryptographic key pair is used during compilation to create a strong-named assembly. You can create a key pair using the [Strong Name tool (Sn.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md). Key pair files usually have an .snk extension.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In Visual Studio, the C# and Visual Basic project property pages include a **Signing** tab that enables you to select existing key files or to generate new key files without using Sn.exe. In Visual C++, you can specify the location of an existing key file in the **Advanced** property page in the **Linker** section of the **Configuration Properties** section of the **Property Pages** window. The use of the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyFileAttribute> attribute to identify key file pairs has been made obsolete beginning with Visual Studio 2005.\n\n## To create a key pair\n\n1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:\n\n     **sn –k** \\<*file name*>\n\n     In this command, *file name* is the name of the output file containing the key pair.\n\n The following example creates a key pair called `sgKey.snk`.\n\n```\nsn -k sgKey.snk\n```\n\n If you intend to delay sign an assembly and you control the whole key pair (which is unlikely outside test scenarios), you can use the following commands to generate a key pair and then extract the public key from it into a separate file. First, create the key pair:\n\n```\nsn -k keypair.snk\n```\n\n Next, extract the public key from the key pair and copy it to a separate file:\n\n```\nsn -p keypair.snk public.snk\n```\n\n Once you create the key pair, you must put the file where the strong name signing tools can find it.\n\n When signing an assembly with a strong name, the [Assembly Linker (Al.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md) looks for the key file relative to the current directory and to the output directory. When using command-line compilers, you can simply copy the key to the current directory containing your code modules.\n\n If you are using an earlier version of Visual Studio that does not have a **Signing** tab in the project properties, the recommended key file location is the project directory with the file attribute specified as follows:\n\n [!code-cpp[AssemblyName_KeyPair#21](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AssemblyName_KeyPair/CPP/keyfileattrib.cpp#21)]\n [!code-csharp[AssemblyName_KeyPair#21](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AssemblyName_KeyPair/CS/keyfileattrib.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[AssemblyName_KeyPair#21](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/AssemblyName_KeyPair/VB/keyfileattrib.vb#21)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/create-and-use-strong-named-assemblies.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,492],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs:\n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"key pairs for strong-named assemblies\"\n  - \"signing assemblies\"\n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], signing\"\n  - \"cryptographic key pairs\"\n  - \"snk files (key pair files)\"\n  - \"public-private key pairs\"\n  - \".snk files\"\n  - \"strong-named assemblies, key pairs\"\nms.assetid: 05026813-f3bd-4d7c-9e0b-fc588eb3d114\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","pos":[0,40]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[499,539],"content":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","linkify":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Public-Private Key Pair","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"To sign an assembly with a strong name, you must have a public/private key pair.","pos":[541,621]},{"content":"This public and private cryptographic key pair is used during compilation to create a strong-named assembly.","pos":[622,730]},{"content":"You can create a key pair using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Strong Name tool (Sn.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md)</ept>.","pos":[731,853],"source":" You can create a key pair using the [Strong Name tool (Sn.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md)."},{"content":"Key pair files usually have an .snk extension.","pos":[854,900]},{"pos":[904,1467],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIn Visual Studio, the C# and Visual Basic project property pages include a **Signing** tab that enables you to select existing key files or to generate new key files without using Sn.exe.
