It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.  \n  \n The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A> property. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A> property is set to `false`, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A> property is set to `true`, the user cannot select dithered colors. To display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog>   \n [ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/colordialog-component-windows-forms.md)   \n [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,75],"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,63]}]},{"pos":[561,607],"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog&gt;</ph> component is a pre-configured dialog box that allows the user to select a color from a palette and to add custom colors to that palette.","pos":[608,802],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> component is a pre-configured dialog box that allows the user to select a color from a palette and to add custom colors to that palette."},{"content":"It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors.","pos":[803,895]},{"content":"Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[896,1005]},{"content":"The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[1012,1126],"source":"The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A> property."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette.","pos":[1127,1332],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A> property is set to `false`, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`true`</ph>, the user cannot select dithered colors.","pos":[1333,1464],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A> property is set to `true`, the user cannot select dithered colors."},{"content":"To display the dialog box, you must call its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1465,1572],"source":" To display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method."},{"pos":[1581,1589],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog&gt;</ph>","pos":[1593,1632],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>ColorDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/colordialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1636,1746],"source":" [ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/colordialog-component-windows-forms.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Dialog-Box Controls and Components<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1749,1885],"source":" [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)</ept>","pos":[1888,2084],"source":" [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)"}]}
