The sample consists of a server targeting [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)], which implements a contract with generic types, and two different clients, one targeting [!INCLUDE[dnprdnlong](../../../../includes/dnprdnlong-md.md)] and another targeting [!INCLUDE[netfx40_short](../../../../includes/netfx40-short-md.md)].  \n  \n The server attaches a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationBinder> to the binary formatter to be able to change the version of the types accordingly on serialization, so both clients can deserialize those types properly.  \n  \n#### To set up, build and run the sample  \n  \n1.  To execute the client, right-click the solution, SBGenericsVTS (6 projects) and then select **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In **Common Properties**, select **Startup Project**, then select **Multiple Startup Projects**.  \n  \n3.  Select **Server** first, then **Client20** and then **Client40**. Select the **Start** action to these three projects and leave the rest set to **None**.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK** and then press F5 to run the sample.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,113],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Usage of Serialization Binder\"\nms.date:
