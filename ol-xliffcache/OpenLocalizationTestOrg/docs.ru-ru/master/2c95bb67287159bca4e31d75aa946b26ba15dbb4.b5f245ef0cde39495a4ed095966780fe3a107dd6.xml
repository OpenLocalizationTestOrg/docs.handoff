That means every type in which it is nested must be compliant.  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40030  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you require CLS compliance, define this type within a different containment hierarchy.  \n  \n-   If you require that this type remain within its current containment hierarchy, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\<PAVE OVER> Writing CLS-Compliant Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4c705105-69a2-4e5e-b24e-0633bc32c7f3)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,169],"content":"Type &#39;&lt;typename1&gt;&#39;
