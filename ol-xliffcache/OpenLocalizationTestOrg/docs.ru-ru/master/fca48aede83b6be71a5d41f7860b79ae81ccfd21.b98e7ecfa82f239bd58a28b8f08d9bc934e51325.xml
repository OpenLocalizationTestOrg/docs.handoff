You cannot use the class name itself to qualify a member that is not shared. The instance must first be declared as an object variable and then referenced by the variable name.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30469  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Declare the instance as an object variable.  \n  \n2.  Reference the instance by the variable name.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NOT IN BUILD: Understanding Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/cc2355a2-cb98-4353-9440-736585aec46c)   \n [NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d)   \n [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)   \n [NOTINBUILD: Resolving a Reference When Multiple Variables Have the Same Name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9601e39f-1911-44e1-ace5-3f6e090408b9)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,90],"content":"Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,78]}]},{"pos":[606,667],"content":"Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference","linkify":"Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference to a non-shared member requires an object reference","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"You have referenced a non-shared member within your code and failed to supply an object reference.","pos":[668,766]},{"content":"You cannot use the class name itself to qualify a member that is not shared.","pos":[767,843]},{"content":"The instance must first be declared as an object variable and then referenced by the variable name.","pos":[844,943]},{"pos":[950,971],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30469","source":"**Error ID:** BC30469"},{"pos":[980,1001],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Declare the instance as an object variable.","pos":[1011,1054]},{"content":"Reference the instance by the variable name.","pos":[1064,1108]},{"pos":[1117,1125],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Understanding Classes<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/cc2355a2-cb98-4353-9440-736585aec46c)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1129,1237],"source":"[NOT IN BUILD: Understanding Classes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/cc2355a2-cb98-4353-9440-736585aec46c) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1240,1358],"source":" [NOT IN BUILD: Shared Members in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/dbc3783f-83a2-4225-995d-c2d6d025663d) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1361,1430],"source":" [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>NOTINBUILD: Resolving a Reference When Multiple Variables Have the Same Name<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9601e39f-1911-44e1-ace5-3f6e090408b9)</ept>","pos":[1433,1582],"source":" [NOTINBUILD: Resolving a Reference When Multiple Variables Have the Same Name](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9601e39f-1911-44e1-ace5-3f6e090408b9)"}]}
