For example, because the calculation in the following example is performed in an `unchecked` block or expression, the fact that the result is too large for an integer is ignored, and `int1` is assigned the value -2,147,483,639.\n\n[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsChecked#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsChecked/CS/csrefKeywordsChecked.cs#5)]\n\nIf the `unchecked` environment is removed, a compilation error occurs. The overflow can be detected at compile time because all the terms of the expression are constants.\n\nExpressions that contain non-constant terms are unchecked by default at compile time and run time. See [checked](checked.md) for information about enabling a checked environment.\n\nBecause checking for overflow takes time, the use of unchecked code in situations where there is no danger of overflow might improve performance. However, if overflow is a possibility, a checked environment should be used.\n\n## Example\n\nThis sample shows how to use the `unchecked` keyword.\n\n[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsChecked#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsChecked/CS/csrefKeywordsChecked.cs#2)]\n\n## C# language specification\n\n[!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](~/includes/csharplangspec-md.md)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [C# Keywords](index.md)\n- [Checked and Unchecked](checked-and-unchecked.md)\n- [checked](checked.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,244],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"unchecked keyword - C# Reference\"\nms.custom: seodec18\n\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords:\n  - \"unchecked_CSharpKeyword\"\n  - \"unchecked\"\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"unchecked keyword [C#]\"\nms.assetid: 0c021f7c-923f-4b3d-a58f-55336f5ac27e","nodes":[{"content":"unchecked keyword - C# Reference","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"unchecked keyword - C# Reference","nodes":[{"content":"unchecked keyword - C# Reference","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[251,275],"content":"unchecked (C# Reference)","linkify":"unchecked (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"unchecked (C# Reference)","pos":[0,24]}]},{"pos":[277,395],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`unchecked`</ph> keyword is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.","source":"The `unchecked` keyword is used to suppress overflow-checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions."},{"content":"In an unchecked context, if an expression produces a value that is outside the range of the destination type, the overflow is not flagged.","pos":[397,535]},{"content":"For example, because the calculation in the following example is performed in an <ph id=\"ph1\">`unchecked`</ph> block or expression, the fact that the result is too large for an integer is ignored, and <ph id=\"ph2\">`int1`</ph> is assigned the value -2,147,483,639.","pos":[536,763],"source":" For example, because the calculation in the following example is performed in an `unchecked` block or expression, the fact that the result is too large for an integer is ignored, and `int1` is assigned the value -2,147,483,639."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">`unchecked`</ph> environment is removed, a compilation error occurs.","pos":[903,973],"source":"If the `unchecked` environment is removed, a compilation error occurs."},{"content":"The overflow can be detected at compile time because all the terms of the expression are constants.","pos":[974,1073]},{"content":"Expressions that contain non-constant terms are unchecked by default at compile time and run time.","pos":[1075,1173]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>checked<ept id=\"p1\">](checked.md)</ept> for information about enabling a checked environment.","pos":[1174,1253],"source":" See [checked](checked.md) for information about enabling a checked environment."},{"content":"Because checking for overflow takes time, the use of unchecked code in situations where there is no danger of overflow might improve performance.","pos":[1255,1400]},{"content":"However, if overflow is a possibility, a checked environment should be used.","pos":[1401,1477]},{"pos":[1482,1489],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1491,1544],"content":"This sample shows how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`unchecked`</ph> keyword.","source":"This sample shows how to use the `unchecked` keyword."},{"pos":[1687,1712],"content":"C# language specification","linkify":"C# language specification","nodes":[{"content":"C# language specification","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[1778,1786],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1790,1849],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)"},{"pos":[1852,1918],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1921,1944],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Keywords<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Keywords](index.md)"},{"pos":[1947,1996],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Checked and Unchecked<ept id=\"p1\">](checked-and-unchecked.md)</ept>","source":"[Checked and Unchecked](checked-and-unchecked.md)"},{"pos":[1999,2020],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>checked<ept id=\"p1\">](checked.md)</ept>","source":"[checked](checked.md)"}]}
