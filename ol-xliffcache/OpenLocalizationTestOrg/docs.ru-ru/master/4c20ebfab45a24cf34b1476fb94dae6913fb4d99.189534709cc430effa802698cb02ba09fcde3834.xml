To navigate forward one entry, you call the **GoForward** method. This is illustrated in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HOWTONavigationSnippets#NavigateForwardCODE](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTONavigationSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml.cs#navigateforwardcode)]\n [!code-vb[HOWTONavigationSnippets#NavigateForwardCODE](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTONavigationSnippets/visualbasic/homepage.xaml.vb#navigateforwardcode)]  \n  \n Before you can navigate back one entry, you must first check that there are entries in back navigation history by inspecting the **CanGoBack** property. To navigate back one entry, you call the **GoBack** method. This is illustrated in the following example:  \n  \n
