The calculation runs on a thread that is separate from the user interface thread, so the user interface continues to run without delays as the calculation proceeds.  \n  \n There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Implementing a Form That Uses a Background Operation](walkthrough-implementing-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker/CPP/fibonacciform.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker/CS/fibonacciform.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker/VB/fibonacciform.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  When using multithreading of any sort, you potentially expose yourself to very serious and complex bugs. Consult the [Managed Threading Best Practices](../../../standard/threading/managed-threading-best-practices.md) before implementing any solution that uses multithreading.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker>\n- <xref:System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs>\n- [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md)\n- [Managed Threading Best Practices](../../../standard/threading/managed-threading-best-practices.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,552],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"threading [Windows Forms], forms\"\n  - \"BackgroundWorker component\"\n  - \"background tasks\"\n  - \"forms [Windows Forms], multithreading\"\n  - \"components [Windows Forms], asynchronous\"\n  - \"forms [Windows Forms], background operations\"\n  - \"background threads\"\n  - \"threading [Windows Forms], background operations\"\n  - \"background operations\"\nms.assetid: 9f483f93-1613-4be1-a021-b4934e9c78f3","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","pos":[0,57]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[559,616],"content":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","linkify":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement a Form That Uses a Background Operation","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"The following example program creates a form that calculates Fibonacci numbers.","pos":[617,696]},{"content":"The calculation runs on a thread that is separate from the user interface thread, so the user interface continues to run without delays as the calculation proceeds.","pos":[697,861]},{"content":"There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.","pos":[868,926]},{"pos":[933,1079],"content":"Also see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Walkthrough: Implementing a Form That Uses a Background Operation<ept id=\"p1\">](walkthrough-implementing-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)</ept>.","source":"Also see [Walkthrough: Implementing a Form That Uses a Background Operation](walkthrough-implementing-a-form-that-uses-a-background-operation.md)."},{"pos":[1088,1095],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1604,1622],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1626,1648]},{"content":"References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.","pos":[1658,1736]},{"content":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md)</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Command-line Building With csc.exe<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1743,2097],"source":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)."},{"content":"You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.","pos":[2098,2186]},{"pos":[2195,2213],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[2221,2510],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n When using multithreading of any sort, you potentially expose yourself to very serious and complex bugs.
