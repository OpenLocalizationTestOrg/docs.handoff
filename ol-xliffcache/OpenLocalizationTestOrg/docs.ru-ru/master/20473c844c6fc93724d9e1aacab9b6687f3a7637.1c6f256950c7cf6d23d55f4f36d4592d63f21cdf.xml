To build the project, choose **Build** from the **Build** menu. Also, a reference to the namespace must be added to the class inheriting the form. The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To inherit a form programmatically  \n  \n1.  In your class, add a reference to the namespace containing the form you wish to inherit from.  \n  \n2.  In the class definition, add a reference to the form to inherit from. The reference should include the namespace that contains the form, followed by a period, then the name of the base form itself.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Class Form2  \n        Inherits Namespace1.Form1  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public class Form2 : Namespace1.Form1  \n    ```  \n  \n When inheriting forms, keep in mind that issues may arise with regard to event handlers being called twice, because each event is being handled by both the base class and the inherited class.

Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/troubleshooting-inherited-event-handlers.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Inherits
