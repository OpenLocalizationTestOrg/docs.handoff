The SSL3.0 protocol and RC4 cipher are not supported.  \n  \n## Impact  \n This change affects:  \n  \n-   Any app that uses SSL to talk to an HTTPS server or a socket server using any of the following types: <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient>, <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest>, <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest>, <xref:System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient>, and <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream>.  \n  \n-   Any server-side app that cannot be upgraded to support Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2..  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the sever-side app to Tls1.0, Tls1.1, or Tls 1.2. If this is not feasible, or if client apps are broken, the <xref:System.AppContext> class can be used to opt out of this feature in either of two ways:  \n  \n-   Programmatically, by using a code snippet like the following:  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[AppCompat.SSLProtocols#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.sslprotocols/cs/program.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[AppCompat.SSLProtocols#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/appcompat.sslprotocols/vb/module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n     Because the <xref:System.Net.ServicePointManager> object is initialized only once, defining these compatibility settings must be the first thing the application does.  \n  \n-   By adding the following line to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Net.DontEnableSchUseStrongCrypto=true\"/>  \n    ```  \n  \n Note, however, that opting out of the default behavior is not recommended, since it makes the application less secure.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Retargeting Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,183],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Mitigation: TLS Protocols\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
