In some cases, LINQ to SQL will attempt to retrieve an object from the identity cache before executing a query in the database.  \n  \n In general, for a LINQ to SQL query to return an object from the identity cache, the query must be based on the primary key of an object and must return a single object. In particular, the query must be in one of the general forms shown below.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Pre-compiled queries will not return objects from the identity cache. For more information about pre-compiled queries, see <xref:System.Data.Linq.CompiledQuery> and [How to: Store and Reuse Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-store-and-reuse-queries.md).  \n  \n A query must be in one of the following general forms to retrieve an object from the identity cache:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601> `.Function1(` `predicate` `)`  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Data.Linq.Table%601> `.Function1(` `predicate` `).Function2()`  \n  \n In these general forms, `Function1`, `Function2`, and `predicate` are defined as follows.  \n  \n `Function1` can be any of the following:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Where%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.First%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.FirstOrDefault%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Single%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.SingleOrDefault%2A>  \n  \n `Function2` can be any of the following:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.First%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.FirstOrDefault%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Single%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.SingleOrDefault%2A>  \n  \n `predicate` must be an expression in which the object's primary key property is set to a constant value. If an object has a primary key defined by more than one property, each primary key property must be set to a constant value. The following are examples of the form `predicate` must take:  \n  \n-   `c => c.PK == constant_value`  \n  \n-   `c => c.PK1 == constant_value1 && c=> c.PK2 == constant_value2`  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code provides examples of the types of LINQ to SQL queries that retrieve an object from the identity cache.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[L2S_QueryCache#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/l2s_querycache/cs/program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[L2S_QueryCache#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/l2s_querycache/vb/module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Query Concepts](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/query-concepts.md)   \n [Object Identity](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/object-identity.md)   \n [Background Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)   \n [Object Identity](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/object-identity.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,373],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: 96c13903-ccb6-4a0e-ab6a-8ca955ca314d\ncaps.latest.revision: 2\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","nodes":[{"content":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[380,422],"content":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache","linkify":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache","nodes":[{"content":"Retrieving Objects from the Identity Cache","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"This topic describes the types of LINQ to SQL queries that return an object from the identity cache that is managed by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph>.","pos":[423,582],"source":"This topic describes the types of LINQ to SQL queries that return an object from the identity cache that is managed by the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>."},{"content":"In LINQ to SQL, one of the ways in which the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> manages objects is by logging object identities in an identity cache as queries are executed.","pos":[589,763],"source":"In LINQ to SQL, one of the ways in which the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> manages objects is by logging object identities in an identity cache as queries are executed."},{"content":"In some cases, LINQ to SQL will attempt to retrieve an object from the identity cache before executing a query in the database.","pos":[764,891]},{"content":"In general, for a LINQ to SQL query to return an object from the identity cache, the query must be based on the primary key of an object and must return a single object.","pos":[898,1067]},{"content":"In particular, the query must be in one of the general forms shown below.","pos":[1068,1141]},{"pos":[1149,1448],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Pre-compiled queries will not return objects from the identity cache.
