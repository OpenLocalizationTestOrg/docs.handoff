Determine whether the assembly that contains the function is generated to native format and properly registered.  \n  \n## Effect on the Runtime  \n This MDA logs a message just before a method is JIT-compiled, so enabling this MDA has significant impact on performance. Note that if a method is inline, this MDA will not generate a separate message.  \n  \n## Output  \n The following code sample shows sample output. In this case the output shows that in assembly Test the method \"m\" on class \"ns2.CO\" was JIT-compiled.  \n  \n```  \nmethod name=\"Test!ns2.C0::m\"  \n```  \n  \n## Configuration  \n The following configuration file shows a variety of filters that can be employed to filter out which methods are reported when they are first JIT-compiled. You can specify that all methods be reported by setting the value of the name attribute to *.  \n  \n```  \n<mdaConfig>  \n  <assistants>  \n    <jitCompilationStart>  \n      <methods>  \n        <match name=\"C0::m\" />  \n        <match name=\"MyMethod\" />  \n        <match name=\"C2::*\" />  \n        <match name=\"ns0::*\" />  \n        <match name=\"ns1.C0::*\" />  \n        <match name=\"ns2.C0::m\" />  \n        <match name=\"ns2.C0+N0::m\" />  \n      </methods>  \n    </jitCompilationStart >  \n  </assistants>  \n</mdaConfig>  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code sample is intended to be used with the preceding configuration file.  \n  \n```  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Reflection;  \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;  \nusing System.Runtime.InteropServices;  \n  \npublic class Entry  \n{  \n    public static void Main(string[] args)  \n    {  \n        C0.m();  \n        C1.MyMethod();  \n        C2.m();  \n  \n        ns0.C0.m();  \n        ns0.C0.N0.m();  \n        ns0.C1.m();  \n  \n        ns1.C0.m();  \n        ns1.C0.N0.m();  \n  \n        ns2.C0.m();  \n        ns2.C0.N0.m();  \n    }  \n}  \n  \npublic class C0  \n{  \n    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n    public static void m() { }  \n}  \n  \npublic class C1  \n{  \n    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n    public static void MyMethod() { }  \n}  \n  \npublic class C2  \n{  \n    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n    public static void m() { }  \n}  \n  \nnamespace ns0  \n{  \n    public class C0  \n    {  \n        [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n        public static void m() { }  \n  \n        public class N0  \n        {  \n            [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n            public static void m() { }  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    public class C1  \n    {  \n        [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n        public static void m() { }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nnamespace ns1  \n{  \n    public class C0  \n    {  \n        [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n        public static void m() { }  \n        public class N0  \n        {  \n            [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n            public static void m() { }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nnamespace ns2  \n{  \n    public class C0  \n    {  \n        [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n        public static void m() { }  \n  \n        public class N0  \n        {  \n            [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]  \n            public static void m() { }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute>   \n [Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)   \n [Interop Marshaling](../../../docs/framework/interop/interop-marshaling.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,595],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"jitCompilationStart MDA | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
