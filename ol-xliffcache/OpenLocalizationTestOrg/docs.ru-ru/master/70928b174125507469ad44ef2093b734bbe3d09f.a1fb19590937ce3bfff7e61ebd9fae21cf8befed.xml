The property name is the same as the setting name, and the property type is the same as the setting type. The setting's **Scope** determines if the property is read-only: The property for an **Application**-scope setting is read-only, while the property for a **User**-scope setting is read-write. For more information, see [My.Settings Object](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Although you can change and save the values of user-scope settings at run time, application-scope settings are read-only and cannot be changed programmatically. You can change application-scope settings when you create the application by using the **Project Designer** or by editing the application's configuration file. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example changes the value of the `Nickname` user setting.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#7](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-change-user-settings_1.vb)]  \n  \n For this example to work, your application must have a `Nickname` user setting, of type `String`.  \n  \n The application saves the user settings when the application shuts down. To save the settings immediately, call the `My.Settings.Save` method.
