The new collection contains all the same elements as the old collection, but without a nested structure.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nFLATTEN ( collection )  \n```  \n  \n## Arguments  \n `collection`  \n Any valid expression that returns a collection of value collections to flatten into a single collection.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `FLATTEN` is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. See [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md) for precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses the `FLATTEN` operator to convert a collection of collections into a flattened collection. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  \n  \n2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts 2#FLATTEN](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts 2/cs/entitysql.cs#flatten)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,104],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 1a670c63-0a29-4738-80e6-101f66af05c3","nodes":[{"content":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[111,131],"content":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","linkify":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"FLATTEN (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"Converts a collection of collections into a flattened collection.","pos":[132,197]},{"content":"The new collection contains all the same elements as the old collection, but without a nested structure.","pos":[198,302]},{"pos":[311,317],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[366,375],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Any valid expression that returns a collection of value collections to flatten into a single collection.","pos":[395,499]},{"pos":[508,515],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`FLATTEN`</ph> is one of the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators.","pos":[519,613],"source":"`FLATTEN` is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators."},{"content":"All <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators are evaluated from left to right.","pos":[614,721],"source":" All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right."},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>EXCEPT<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md)</ept> for precedence information for the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators.","pos":[722,929],"source":" See [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md) for precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators."},{"pos":[938,945],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following Entity SQL query uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">`FLATTEN`</ph> operator to convert a collection of collections into a flattened collection.","pos":[949,1075],"source":"The following Entity SQL query uses the `FLATTEN` operator to convert a collection of collections into a flattened collection."},{"content":"To compile and run this query, follow these steps:","pos":[1076,1126]},{"pos":[1136,1333],"content":"Follow the procedure in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md)</ept>.","source":"Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md)."},{"pos":[1343,1426],"content":"Pass the following query as an argument to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery`</ph> method:","source":"Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:"},{"pos":[1607,1615],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1619,1733],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)</ept>","source":"[Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)"}]}
