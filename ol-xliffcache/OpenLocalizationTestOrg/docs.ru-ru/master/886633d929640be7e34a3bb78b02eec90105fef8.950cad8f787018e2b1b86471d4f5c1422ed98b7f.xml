In this case, the debugger receives the [ICorDebugUnmanagedCallback::DebugEvent](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugunmanagedcallback-debugevent-method.md) callback with its `fOutOfBand` parameter set to `false`.  \n  \n An *out-of-band event* is an unmanaged event during which interaction with the managed state of the process is impossible while the process is stopped due to the event. In this case, the debugger receives the `ICorDebugUnmanagedCallback::DebugEvent` callback with its `fOutOfBand` parameter set to `true`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n ","nodes":[{"pos":[12,65],"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,53]}]},{"pos":[711,747],"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","linkify":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[748,902],"content":"Resumes execution of managed threads after a call to <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Stop Method<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugcontroller-stop-method.md)</ept>.","source":"Resumes execution of managed threads after a call to [Stop Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugcontroller-stop-method.md)."},{"pos":[911,917],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[998,1008],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] Set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> if continuing from an out-of-band event;
