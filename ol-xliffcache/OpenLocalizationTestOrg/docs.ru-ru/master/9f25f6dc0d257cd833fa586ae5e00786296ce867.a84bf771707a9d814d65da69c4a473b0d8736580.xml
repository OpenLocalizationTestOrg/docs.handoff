For secret-key encryption, you must know both the key and IV that were used to encrypt the data. For public-key encryption, you must know either the public key (if the data was encrypted using the private key) or the private key (if the data was encrypted using the public key).  \n  \n## Symmetric Decryption  \n The decryption of data encrypted with symmetric algorithms is similar to the process used to encrypt data with symmetric algorithms. The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream> class is used with symmetric cryptography classes provided by the .NET Framework to decrypt data read from any managed stream object.  \n  \n The following example illustrates how to create a new instance of the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RijndaelManaged> class and use it to perform decryption on a <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream> object. This example first creates a new instance of the **RijndaelManaged** class. Next it creates a **CryptoStream** object and initializes it to the value of a managed stream called `MyStream`. Next, the **CreateDecryptor** method from the **RijndaelManaged** class is passed the same key and IV that was used for encryption and is then passed to the **CryptoStream** constructor. Finally, the **CryptoStreamMode.Read** enumeration is passed to the **CryptoStream** constructor to specify read access to the stream.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim RMCrypto As New RijndaelManaged()  \nDim CryptStream As New CryptoStream(MyStream, RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(RMCrypto.Key, RMCrypto.IV), CryptoStreamMode.Read)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nRijndaelManaged RMCrypto = new RijndaelManaged();  \nCryptoStream CryptStream = new CryptoStream(MyStream, RMCrypto.CreateDecryptor(Key, IV), CryptoStreamMode.Read);  \n```  \n  \n The following example shows the entire process of creating a stream, decrypting the stream, reading from the stream, and closing the streams. A <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener> object is created that initializes a network stream when a connection to the listening object is made. The network stream is then decrypted using the **CryptoStream** class and the **RijndaelManaged** class. This example assumes that the key and IV values have been either successfully transferred or previously agreed upon. It does not show the code needed to encrypt and transfer these values.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.Net.Sockets  \nImports System.Threading  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Net  \nImports System.Security.Cryptography  \n  \nModule Module1  \n    Sub Main()  \n            'The key and IV must be the same values that were used  \n            'to encrypt the stream.    \n            Dim Key As Byte() = {&H1, &H2, &H3, &H4, &H5, &H6, &H7, &H8, &H9, &H10, &H11, &H12, &H13, &H14, &H15, &H16}  \n            Dim IV As Byte() = {&H1, &H2, &H3, &H4, &H5, &H6, &H7, &H8, &H9, &H10, &H11, &H12, &H13, &H14, &H15, &H16}  \n        Try  \n            'Initialize a TCPListener on port 11000  \n            'using the current IP address.  \n            Dim TCPListen As New TcpListener(IPAddress.Any, 11000)  \n  \n            'Start the listener.  \n            TCPListen.Start()  \n  \n            'Check for a connection every five seconds.  \n            While Not TCPListen.Pending()  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Still listening.

The connection must use the same key, IV, and algorithm used in the listener. If such a connection is made, the message is decrypted and displayed to the console.  \n  \n## Asymmetric Decryption  \n Typically, a party (party A) generates both a public and private key and stores the key either in memory or in a cryptographic key container.  Party A then sends the public key to another party (party B).  Using the public key, party B encrypts data and sends the data back to party A.  After receiving the data, party A decrypts it using the private key that corresponds.  Decryption will be successful only if party A uses the private key that corresponds to the public key Party B used to encrypt the data.  \n  \n For information on how to store an asymmetric key in secure cryptographic key container and how to later retrieve the asymmetric key, see [How to: Store Asymmetric Keys in a Key Container](../../../docs/standard/security/how-to-store-asymmetric-keys-in-a-key-container.md).  \n  \n The following example illustrates the decryption of two arrays of bytes that represent a symmetric key and IV.  For information on how to extract the asymmetric public key from the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.RSACryptoServiceProvider> object in a format that you can easily send to a third party, see [Encrypting Data](../../../docs/standard/security/encrypting-data.md).  \n  \n```vb  \n'Create a new instance of the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.  \nDim RSA As New RSACryptoServiceProvider()  \n  \n' Export the public key information and send it to a third party.  \n' Wait for the third party to encrypt some data and send it back.  \n  \n'Decrypt the symmetric key and IV.  \nSymmetricKey = RSA.Decrypt(EncryptedSymmetricKey, False)  \nSymmetricIV = RSA.Decrypt(EncryptedSymmetricIV, False)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \n//Create a new instance of the RSACryptoServiceProvider class.  \nRSACryptoServiceProvider RSA = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();  \n  \n// Export the public key information and send it to a third party.  \n// Wait for the third party to encrypt some data and send it back.  \n  \n//Decrypt the symmetric key and IV.  \nSymmetricKey = RSA.Decrypt( EncryptedSymmetricKey, false);  \nSymmetricIV = RSA.Decrypt( EncryptedSymmetricIV , false);  \n```  \n  \n## See Also
