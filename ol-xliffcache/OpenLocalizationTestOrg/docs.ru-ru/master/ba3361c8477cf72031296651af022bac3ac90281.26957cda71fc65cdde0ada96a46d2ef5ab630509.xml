Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, all its contained controls move, too.  \n  \n The group box's caption is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property. For more information, see [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md).  \n  \n## GroupBox and Panel  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [GroupBox Control](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,294],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"GroupBox\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"GroupBox control [Windows Forms], about GroupBox control\"\n  - \"grouping controls [Windows Forms], Windows Forms\"\nms.assetid: 03bd8ff9-c905-4f01-9bc6-8438b11d0881","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[301,342],"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[343,467],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[468,531]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[532,642]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control, all its contained controls move, too.","pos":[643,882],"source":" Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, all its contained controls move, too."},{"content":"The group box's caption is defined by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[889,985],"source":"The group box's caption is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)</ept>.","pos":[986,1133],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)."},{"pos":[1142,1160],"content":"GroupBox and Panel","linkify":"GroupBox and Panel","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox and Panel","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1164,1433],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control; however, only the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control displays a caption, and only the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control can have scroll bars.","source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars."},{"pos":[1442,1450],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1454,1507],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[GroupBox Control](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
