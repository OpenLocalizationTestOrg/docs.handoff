Once selected, you can iterate over the selected set of nodes.  \n  \n## XPathNavigator Selection Methods  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class provides a set of methods used to select a set of nodes in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> or <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object using an XPath expression. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class also provides a set of optimized methods for selecting ancestor, child and descendant nodes faster than using an XPath expression. The selected set of nodes is returned in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object or an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object in the case of a single selected node.  \n  \n### Selecting Nodes Using XPath Expressions  \n To select a set of nodes using an XPath expression, use one of the following selection methods.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A>  \n  \n When called, these methods return a set of nodes that you can navigate freely using an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object or an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object in the case of a single selected node.  \n  \n Navigating with an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object does not affect the position of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object used to create it. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object returned from the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A> methods is positioned on the single returned node and also does not affect the position of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object used to create it.  \n  \n The following example shows the creation of an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object from an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object, the use of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> method to select nodes in the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument> object, and the use of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object to iterate over the selected nodes.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument(\"books.xml\")  \nDim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  \nDim nodes As XPathNodeIterator = navigator.Select(\"/bookstore/book\")  \n  \nWhile nodes.MoveNext()  \n    Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Name)  \nEnd While  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nXPathDocument document = new XPathDocument(\"books.xml\");  \nXPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  \nXPathNodeIterator nodes = navigator.Select(\"/bookstore/book\");  \n  \nwhile(nodes.MoveNext())  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Name);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.  \n  \n [!code-xml[XPathXMLExamples#1](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/XPathXMLExamples/XML/books.xml#1)]  \n  \n### Optimized Selection Methods  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectChildren%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectAncestors%2A>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectDescendants%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class represent XPath expressions commonly used to retrieve child, descendant, and ancestor nodes. These methods are optimized for performance and are faster than their corresponding XPath expressions. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectChildren%2A>, <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectAncestors%2A>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectDescendants%2A> methods selects ancestor, child, and descendant nodes based on an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeType> value or the local name and namespace URI of the nodes to select. The selected ancestor, child, and descendant nodes are returned in an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> object.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>   \n
