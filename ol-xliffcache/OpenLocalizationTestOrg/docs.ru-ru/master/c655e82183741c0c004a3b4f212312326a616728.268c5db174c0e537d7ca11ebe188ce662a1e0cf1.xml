For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> but not in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. This different behavior occurs because <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> measures in the direction of stacking at <xref:System.Double>.<xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity>; however, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> measures only the available size.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates this key difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[StackPanelOvw4#1](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/CPP/StackPanel_Ovw_Sample4.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[StackPanelOvw4#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/CSharp/StackPanel_Ovw_Sample4.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[StackPanelOvw4#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/VisualBasic/StackPanelSamp.vb#1)]\n [!code-xml[StackPanelOvw4#1](../../../../samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/XAML/default.xaml#1)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>   \n [Panels Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,575],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-wpf\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [WPF], DockPanel\"\n  - \"DockPanel control, StackPanel control compared to\"\n  - \"StackPanel control, DockPanel control compared to\"\n  - \"controls [WPF], StackPanel\"\nms.assetid: f9239086-451f-42e6-81f7-ef89ef349742\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[582,629],"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","linkify":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to choose between using a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> or a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> when you stack content in a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[630,832],"source":"This example shows how to choose between using a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> or a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> when you stack content in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>."},{"pos":[841,848],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Although you can use either <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> to stack child elements, the two controls do not always produce the same results.","pos":[852,1047],"source":"Although you can use either <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> to stack child elements, the two controls do not always produce the same results."},{"content":"For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> but not in a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1048,1240],"source":" For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> but not in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>."},{"content":"This different behavior occurs because <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> measures in the direction of stacking at <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Double&gt;</ph>.<ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity&gt;</ph>;
