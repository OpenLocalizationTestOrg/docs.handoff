For information about canonical functions, see [Canonical Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/canonical-functions.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.AsUnicode%2A> and <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.AsNonUnicode%2A> methods in the <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions> class do not have canonical function equivalents.  \n  \n Canonical functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value (also known as aggregate canonical functions) can be directly invoked. Other canonical functions can only be called as part of a LINQ to Entities query. To call an aggregate function directly, you must pass an <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> to the function. For more information, see the second example below.  \n  \n You can call some canonical functions by using common language runtime (CLR) methods in LINQ to Entities queries. For a list of CLR methods that map to canonical functions, see [CLR Method to Canonical Function Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/clr-method-to-canonical-function-mapping.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=msftdbprodsamples). The example executes a LINQ to Entities query that uses the <xref:System.Data.Objects.EntityFunctions.DiffDays%2A> method to return all products for which the difference between `SellEndDate` and `SellStartDate` is less than 365 days:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E CanonicalAndStoreFunctions#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp l2e canonicalandstorefunctions/cs/program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E CanonicalAndStoreFunctions#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp l2e canonicalandstorefunctions/vb/module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=msftdbprodsamples).
