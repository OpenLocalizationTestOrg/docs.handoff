A useful property of [delegate](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md) objects is that multiple objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the `+` operator. The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates. When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order. Only delegates of the same type can be combined.  \n  \n The `-` operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[csProgGuideDelegates#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideDelegates/CS/Delegates.cs#11)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.MulticastDelegate>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,256],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)- C# Programming Guide\"\nms.custom: seodec18\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"delegates [C#], combining\"\n  - \"multicast delegates [C#]\"\nms.assetid: 4e689450-6d0c-46de-acfd-f961018ae5dd","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)- C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"pos":[0,69],"content":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)- C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)- C# Programming Guide","pos":[0,69]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[263,332],"content":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)(C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)(C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Combine Delegates (Multicast Delegates)(C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,69]}]},{"content":"This example demonstrates how to create multicast delegates.","pos":[333,393]},{"content":"A useful property of <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>delegate<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md)</ept> objects is that multiple objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> operator.","pos":[394,583],"source":" A useful property of [delegate](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/delegate.md) objects is that multiple objects can be assigned to one delegate instance by using the `+` operator."},{"content":"The multicast delegate contains a list of the assigned delegates.","pos":[584,649]},{"content":"When the multicast delegate is called, it invokes the delegates in the list, in order.","pos":[650,736]},{"content":"Only delegates of the same type can be combined.","pos":[737,785]},{"pos":[792,878],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-`</ph> operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate.","source":"The `-` operator can be used to remove a component delegate from a multicast delegate."},{"pos":[887,894],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1034,1042],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1080,1146],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1149,1208],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/index.md)"}]}
