Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31440  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Add an implementation method for the partial method. The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Definition of the partial method signature.  \nPartial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  \n    ' The body of the signature is empty.  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n' Implementation of the partial method.  \nPrivate Sub OnNameChanged()  \n    MsgBox(\"Name was changed to \" & Me.Name)  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)\n- [Partial Methods](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,247],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31440\"\n  - \"bc31440\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31440\"\nms.assetid: 924dbada-3e0a-4004-a3ae-a209b7c3d1fa","nodes":[{"content":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,86],"content":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","nodes":[{"content":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","pos":[0,86]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[254,340],"content":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","linkify":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","nodes":[{"content":"'AddressOf' cannot be applied to 'methodname' because 'methodname' is a partial method","pos":[0,86]}]},{"content":"A partial method has been passed to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[341,402],"source":"A partial method has been passed to the `AddressOf` operator."},{"content":"Partial methods are invalid values for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[403,467],"source":" Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator."},{"pos":[474,495],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31440","source":"**Error ID:** BC31440"},{"pos":[504,525],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Add an implementation method for the partial method.","pos":[535,587]},{"content":"The implementation method is a valid value for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[588,660],"source":" The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator."},{"content":"The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.","pos":[661,739]},{"pos":[1037,1045],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1049,1140],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1143,1246],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Partial Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Partial Methods](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)"}]}
