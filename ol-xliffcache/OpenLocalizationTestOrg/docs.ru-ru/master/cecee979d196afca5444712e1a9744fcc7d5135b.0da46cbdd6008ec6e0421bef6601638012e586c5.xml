To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To position a control on the design surface of the Windows Forms Designer  \n  \n-   Drag the control to the appropriate location with the mouse.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Select the control and move it with the ARROW keys to position it more precisely. Also, *snaplines* assist you in placing controls precisely on your form. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md).  \n  \n### To position a control using the Properties window  \n  \n1.  Click the control you want to position.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, type values for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property, separated by a comma, to position the control within its container.  \n  \n     The first number (X) is the distance from the left border of the container; the second number (Y) is the distance from the upper border of the container area, measured in pixels.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can expand the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to type the **X** and **Y** values individually.  \n  \n### To position a control programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property of the control to a <xref:System.Drawing.Point>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Location = new Point(100, 100);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Location = Point(100, 100);  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Change the X coordinate of the control's location using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Left = 300  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Left = 300;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Left = 300;  \n    ```  \n  \n### To increment a control's location programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> subproperty to increment the X coordinate of the control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Button1.Left += 200  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    button1.Left += 200;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    button1->Left += 200;  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property to set a control's X and Y positions simultaneously. To set a position individually, use the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Left%2A> (**X**) or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Top%2A> (**Y**) subproperty. Do not try to implicitly set the X and Y coordinates of the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> structure that represents the button's location, because this structure contains a copy of the button's coordinates.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a TableLayoutPanel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-tablelayoutpanel.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a FlowLayoutPanel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-flowlayoutpanel.md)   \n [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)   \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Windows Forms Controls by Function](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-by-function.md)   \n [How to: Set the Screen Location of Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/cb023ab7-dea7-4284-9aa6-8c03c59b60c6)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,71],"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[624,666],"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Position Controls on Windows Forms","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"To position controls, use the Windows Forms Designer, or specify the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[667,793],"source":"To position controls, use the Windows Forms Designer, or specify the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A> property."},{"pos":[801,1177],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
