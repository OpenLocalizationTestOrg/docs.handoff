Manipulations enable users to move, rotate, and resize components by using manipulators, such as a mouse device, a stylus, or (in a direct touch-enabled scenario) their fingers. *Inertia* emulates real-world behavior for UI elements that are in motion by simulating friction forces on the elements. This enables elements to gradually slow their movement (both linear and angular) before coming to a stop.  \n  \n Manipulations and inertia processing can be used in a variety of UI frameworks, such as Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or Microsoft XNA.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Manipulations and Inertia Overview](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/manipulations-and-inertia-overview.md)  \n  \n [Using Manipulations and Inertia in an XNA Application](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/use-manipulations-and-inertia-in-an-xna-application.md)  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Input.Manipulations>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"Manipulations and Inertia | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Manipulations and Inertia | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[361,386],"content":"Manipulations and Inertia","linkify":"Manipulations and Inertia","nodes":[{"content":"Manipulations and Inertia","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>manipulations<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>inertia<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> processor classes assist your application in moving user interface (UI) elements on the screen in a natural and intuitive way.","pos":[387,547],"source":"The *manipulations* and *inertia* processor classes assist your application in moving user interface (UI) elements on the screen in a natural and intuitive way."},{"content":"Manipulations enable users to move, rotate, and resize components by using manipulators, such as a mouse device, a stylus, or (in a direct touch-enabled scenario) their fingers.","pos":[548,725]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Inertia<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> emulates real-world behavior for UI elements that are in motion by simulating friction forces on the elements.","pos":[726,846],"source":"*Inertia* emulates real-world behavior for UI elements that are in motion by simulating friction forces on the elements."},{"content":"This enables elements to gradually slow their movement (both linear and angular) before coming to a stop.","pos":[847,952]},{"content":"Manipulations and inertia processing can be used in a variety of UI frameworks, such as Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or Microsoft XNA.","pos":[959,1112]},{"pos":[1121,1136],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"pos":[1140,1266],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Manipulations and Inertia Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/manipulations-and-inertia-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Manipulations and Inertia Overview](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/manipulations-and-inertia-overview.md)"},{"pos":[1273,1435],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Manipulations and Inertia in an XNA Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/use-manipulations-and-inertia-in-an-xna-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Manipulations and Inertia in an XNA Application](../../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/use-manipulations-and-inertia-in-an-xna-application.md)"},{"pos":[1444,1453],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]}]}
