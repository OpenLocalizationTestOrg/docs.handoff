The `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method allows the application to play only one background sound at a time; when the application plays a new background sound, it stops playing the previous background sound. You can also play a sound and wait for it to complete.  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When `AudioPlayMode.WaitToComplete` is specified, `My.Computer.Audio.Play` waits until the sound completes before calling code continues. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#15](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_1.vb)]  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#16](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_2.vb)]  \n  \n## Playing Looping Sounds  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#11](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_3.vb)]  \n  \n In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#12](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_4.vb)]  \n  \n The preceding code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Forms Applications > Sound**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should eventually stop the sound.  \n  \n## Stopping the Playing of Sounds in the Background  \n Use the `My.Computer.Audio.Stop` method to stop the application's currently playing background or looping sound.  \n  \n In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should stop the sound at some point.  \n  \n The following example stops a sound that is playing in the background.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#18](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_5.vb)]  \n  \n The preceding code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Forms Applications > Sound**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n## Playing System Sounds  \n Use the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play the specified system sound.  \n  \n The `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method takes as a parameter one of the shared members from the <xref:System.Media.SystemSound> class. The system sound <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk%2A> generally denotes errors.  \n  \n The following example uses the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play a system sound.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#17](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/playing-sounds_6.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.Play%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.PlaySystemSound%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.Stop%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.AudioPlayMode>","nodes":[{"pos":[4,754],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"system sounds, playing\"\n  - \"system sounds\"\n  - \"playing sounds, Visual Basic\"\n  - \"sound loops\"\n  - \"My.Computer.Audio object, tasks\"\n  - \"sounds, playing\"\n  - \"sounds, background\"\n  - \"playing sounds\"\nms.assetid: f0d9e4ab-57c7-47b6-86d3-99ff07078040\ncaps.latest.revision: 21\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[761,790],"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[791,858],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.Computer.Audio`</ph> object provides methods for playing sounds.","source":"The `My.Computer.Audio` object provides methods for playing sounds."},{"pos":[867,881],"content":"Playing Sounds","linkify":"Playing Sounds","nodes":[{"content":"Playing Sounds","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"Background playing lets the application execute other code while the sound plays.","pos":[885,966]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.Computer.Audio.Play`</ph> method allows the application to play only one background sound at a time;
