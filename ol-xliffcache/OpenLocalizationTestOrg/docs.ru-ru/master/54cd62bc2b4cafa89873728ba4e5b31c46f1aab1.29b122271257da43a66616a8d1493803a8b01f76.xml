Ensure that an instance of the delegate class has been created with a `Dim` statement and that a procedure has been assigned to the delegate instance with the `AddressOf` operator.  \n  \n2.  Locate the code that implements the delegate class and make sure it implements the `Invoke` procedure.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Delegates](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)   \n [Delegate Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)   \n [AddressOf Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)   \n [Dim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,161],"content":"Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Delegate class &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>classname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,149],"source":"Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[700,832],"content":"Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call","linkify":"Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call","nodes":[{"content":"Delegate class &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>classname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call","pos":[0,132],"source":"Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call"}]},{"pos":[833,940],"content":"A call to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Invoke`</ph> through a delegate has failed because <ph id=\"ph2\">`Invoke`</ph> is not implemented on the delegate class.","source":"A call to `Invoke` through a delegate has failed because `Invoke` is not implemented on the delegate class."},{"pos":[947,968],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30220","source":"**Error ID:** BC30220"},{"pos":[977,998],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1008,1188],"content":"Ensure that an instance of the delegate class has been created with a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Dim`</ph> statement and that a procedure has been assigned to the delegate instance with the <ph id=\"ph2\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","source":"Ensure that an instance of the delegate class has been created with a `Dim` statement and that a procedure has been assigned to the delegate instance with the `AddressOf` operator."},{"pos":[1198,1300],"content":"Locate the code that implements the delegate class and make sure it implements the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Invoke`</ph> procedure.","source":"Locate the code that implements the delegate class and make sure it implements the `Invoke` procedure."},{"pos":[1309,1317],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegates<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1321,1411],"source":"[Delegates](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1414,1511],"source":" [Delegate Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1514,1610],"source":" [AddressOf Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Dim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1613,1699],"source":" [Dim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)"}]}
