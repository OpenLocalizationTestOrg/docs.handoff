The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.SelectSingleNode%2A> method returns an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> object, not one of the W3C XPath return types.  \n  \n### The ReturnType Property  \n After an XPath query has been compiled into an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object, you can use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object to determine what the XPath query returns.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property returns one of the following <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType> enumeration values representing the W3C XPath return types.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathResultType>  \n  \n The following example uses the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object to return a number and a node set from the `books.xml` file. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression.ReturnType%2A> property of each <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathExpression> object as well as the results from the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Evaluate%2A> and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> methods are written to the console.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim document As XPathDocument = New XPathDocument(\"books.xml\")  \nDim navigator As XPathNavigator = document.CreateNavigator()  \n  \n' Returns a number.  \nDim query1 As XPathExpression = navigator.Compile(\"bookstore/book/price/text()*10\")  \nConsole.WriteLine(query1.ReturnType)  \n  \nDim number As Double = CType(navigator.Evaluate(query1), Double)  \nConsole.WriteLine(number)  \n  \n' Returns a node set.  \nDim query2 As XPathExpression = navigator.Compile(\"bookstore/book/price\")  \nConsole.WriteLine(query2.ReturnType)  \n  \nDim nodes As XPathNodeIterator = navigator.Select(query2)  \nnodes.MoveNext()  \nConsole.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Value)  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nXPathDocument document = new XPathDocument(\"books.xml\");  \nXPathNavigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator();  \n  \n// Returns a number.  \nXPathExpression query1 = navigator.Compile(\"bookstore/book/price/text()*10\");  \nConsole.WriteLine(query1.ReturnType);  \n  \nDouble number = (Double)navigator.Evaluate(query1);  \nConsole.WriteLine(number);  \n  \n// Returns a node set.  \nXPathExpression query2 = navigator.Compile(\"bookstore/book/price\");  \nConsole.WriteLine(query2.ReturnType);  \n  \nXPathNodeIterator nodes = navigator.Select(query2);  \nnodes.MoveNext();  \nConsole.WriteLine(nodes.Current.Value);  \n```  \n  \n The example takes the `books.xml` file as input.  \n  \n [!code-xml[XPathXMLExamples#1](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/XPathXMLExamples/XML/books.xml#1)]  \n  \n### Higher Performance XPath Expressions  \n For better performance, use the most specific XPath expression possible in your queries. For example, if the `book` node is a child node of the `bookstore` node and the `bookstore` node is the top-most element in an XML document, using the XPath expression `/bookstore/book` is faster than using `//book`. The `//book` XPath expression will scan every node in the XML tree to identify matching nodes.  \n  \n Additionally, using the node set navigation methods supplied by the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class may result in improved performance over the selection methods supplied by the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class in cases where your selection criteria are simple. For example, if you need to select the first child of the current node, it is faster to use the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.MoveToFirst%2A> method than to use the `child::*[1]` XPath expression and the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.Select%2A> method.  \n  \n For more information about the node set navigation methods of the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class, see
