When the user clicks this row, a new row is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, with default values. When the user presses ESC, this new row disappears.  \n  \n-   If the user clicks a row header, the whole row is selected.  \n  \n When you bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a data source by setting its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataSource%2A> property, the control:  \n  \n-   Automatically uses the names of the data source's columns as the column header text.  \n  \n-   Is populated with the contents of the data source. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> columns are automatically created for each column in the data source.  \n  \n-   Creates a row for each visible row in the table.  \n  \n-   Automatically sorts the rows based on the underlying data when the user clicks a column header.  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
