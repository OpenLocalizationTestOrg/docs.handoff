In this section, you will learn how to develop a SQL generation component (for SELECT queries) for an [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] provider. For information about insert, update, and delete queries, see [Modification SQL Generation](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/modification-sql-generation.md).  \n  \n To understand this section, you should be familiar with the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] and the ADO.NET Provider Model. You should also understand command trees and <xref:System.Data.Common.CommandTrees.DbExpression>.  \n  \n## The Role of the SQL Generation Module  \n The SQL generation module of an [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] provider translates a given query command tree into a single SQL SELECT statement that targets a SQL:1999-compliant database. The generated SQL should have as few nested queries as possible. The SQL generation module should not simplify the output query command tree. The [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] will do this, for example by eliminating joins and collapsing consecutive filter nodes.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.Common.DbProviderServices> class is the starting point for accessing the SQL generation layer to convert command trees into <xref:System.Data.Common.DbCommand>.  \n  \n## In This
