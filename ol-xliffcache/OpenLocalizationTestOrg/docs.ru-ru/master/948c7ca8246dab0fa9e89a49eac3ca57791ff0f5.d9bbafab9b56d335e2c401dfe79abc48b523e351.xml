This can be caused by one of the following:  \n  \n-   The [/nostdlib](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md) option from the command line compiler has been specified. The /nostdlib option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll. Use this option if you want to define or create a user-specific System namespace.  \n  \n-   An incorrect mscorlib.dll is referenced.  \n  \n-   A corrupt Visual Studio .NET or .NET Framework common language runtime installation exists.  \n  \n-   Residual components from an earlier installation that are incompatible with the latest installation remain.  \n  \n To resolve this problem, take one of the following actions:  \n  \n-   Do not specify the /nostdlib option from the command line compiler.  \n  \n-   Make sure that the project refers to the correct mscorlib.dll.  \n  \n-   Reinstall the .NET Framework common language runtime (if the previous solutions do not solve the problem).","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0518 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0518 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[542,563],"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0518","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Predefined type 'type' is not defined or imported","pos":[564,613]},{"content":"The main cause for this problem is that the project is not importing mscorlib.dll, which defines the entire System namespace.","pos":[620,745]},{"content":"This can be caused by one of the following:","pos":[746,789]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/nostdlib<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md)</ept> option from the command line compiler has been specified.","pos":[799,953],"source":"The [/nostdlib](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md) option from the command line compiler has been specified."},{"content":"The /nostdlib option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll.","pos":[954,1011]},{"content":"Use this option if you want to define or create a user-specific System namespace.","pos":[1012,1093]},{"content":"An incorrect mscorlib.dll is referenced.","pos":[1103,1143]},{"content":"A corrupt Visual Studio .NET or .NET Framework common language runtime installation exists.","pos":[1153,1244]},{"content":"Residual components from an earlier installation that are incompatible with the latest installation remain.","pos":[1254,1361]},{"content":"To resolve this problem, take one of the following actions:","pos":[1368,1427]},{"content":"Do not specify the /nostdlib option from the command line compiler.","pos":[1437,1504]},{"content":"Make sure that the project refers to the correct mscorlib.dll.","pos":[1514,1576]},{"content":"Reinstall the .NET Framework common language runtime (if the previous solutions do not solve the problem).","pos":[1586,1692]}]}
