For example, if you have an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> of `Student` objects, your [From Clause](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/from-clause.md) should look like this:  \n  \n```  \nDim query = From student As Student In arrList   \n...  \n```  \n  \n By specifying the type of the range variable, you are casting each item in the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> to a `Student`.  \n  \n The use of an explicitly typed range variable in a query expression is equivalent to calling the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast%2A> method. <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast%2A> throws an exception if the specified cast cannot be performed. <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast%2A> and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType%2A> are the two Standard Query Operator methods that operate on non-generic <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> types. In Visual Basic, you must explicitly call the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Cast%2A> method on the data source to ensure a specific range variable type. For more information, see [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-query-operations.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows a simple query over an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>. Note that this example uses object initializers when the code calls the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList.Add%2A> method, but this is not a requirement.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System.Collections  \nImports System.Linq  \n  \nModule Module1  \n  \n    Public Class Student  \n        Public Property FirstName As String  \n        Public Property LastName As String  \n        Public Property

                         .LastName = \"Garcia\",   \n                                    .Scores = New Integer() {97, 89, 85, 82}}  \n        Dim student4 As New Student With {.FirstName = \"Sven\",   \n                                    .LastName = \"Mortensen\",   \n                                    .Scores = New Integer() {88, 94, 65, 91}}  \n  \n        Dim arrList As New ArrayList()  \n        arrList.Add(student1)  \n        arrList.Add(student2)  \n        arrList.Add(student3)  \n        arrList.Add(student4)  \n  \n        ' Use an explicit type for non-generic collections  \n        Dim query = From student As Student In arrList   \n                    Where student.Scores(0) > 95   \n                    Select student  \n  \n        For Each student As Student In query  \n            Console.WriteLine(student.LastName & \": \" & student.Scores(0))  \n        Next  \n        ' Keep the console window open in debug mode.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\")  \n        Console.ReadKey()  \n    End Sub  \n  \nEnd Module  \n' Output:  \n'   Omelchenko: 98  \n'   Garcia: 97  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [LINQ to Objects (Visual
