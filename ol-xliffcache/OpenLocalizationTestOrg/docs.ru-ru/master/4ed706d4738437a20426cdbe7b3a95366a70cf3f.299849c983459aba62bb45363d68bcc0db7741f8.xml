It is often used in conjunction with *code refactoring*, by which you split an assembly into two or more assemblies or move code from one assembly to another.  \n  \n Forwarding a type to itself results in circular forwarding. If another assembly attempted to access the forwarded type, it would go through endless forwarding without ever arriving at a type that had not been forwarded.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31425  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Forward the type to a type in a different assembly, or do not forward it at all.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedToAttribute>\n- [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](/cpp/windows/type-forwarding-cpp-cli)\n- [Managing references in a project](/visualstudio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,283],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<typename>' in assembly '<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31425\"\n  - \"vbc31425\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31425\"\n  - \"type forwarding\"\nms.assetid: e3275d55-3f4c-4bbc-9c8f-f55c4e973063","nodes":[{"content":"'<typename>' in assembly '<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,100],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;typename&gt;</ph>' in assembly '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;assemblyname&gt;</ph>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type","source":"'<typename>' in assembly '<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[290,392],"content":"'\\<typename>' in assembly '\\<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type","linkify":"'\\<typename>' in assembly '\\<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>typename&gt;' in assembly '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>assemblyname&gt;' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type","pos":[0,102],"source":"'\\<typename>' in assembly '\\<assemblyname>' has been forwarded to itself and so is an unsupported type"}]},{"pos":[393,576],"content":"An assembly uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedToAttribute&gt;</ph> to forward one of its types to another assembly, but specifies the same type in the same assembly.","source":"An assembly uses the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedToAttribute> to forward one of its types to another assembly, but specifies the same type in the same assembly."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Type forwarding<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> means reassigning the definition of a class, structure, interface, delegate, or enumeration to an assembly other than the one in which it was originally defined.","pos":[583,762],"source":"*Type forwarding* means reassigning the definition of a class, structure, interface, delegate, or enumeration to an assembly other than the one in which it was originally defined."},{"content":"It is often used in conjunction with <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>code refactoring<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, by which you split an assembly into two or more assemblies or move code from one assembly to another.","pos":[763,921],"source":" It is often used in conjunction with *code refactoring*, by which you split an assembly into two or more assemblies or move code from one assembly to another."},{"content":"Forwarding a type to itself results in circular forwarding.","pos":[928,987]},{"content":"If another assembly attempted to access the forwarded type, it would go through endless forwarding without ever arriving at a type that had not been forwarded.","pos":[988,1147]},{"pos":[1154,1175],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31425","source":"**Error ID:** BC31425"},{"pos":[1184,1205],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Forward the type to a type in a different assembly, or do not forward it at all.","pos":[1215,1295]},{"pos":[1304,1312],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1382,1447],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)<ept id=\"p1\">](/cpp/windows/type-forwarding-cpp-cli)</ept>","source":"[Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](/cpp/windows/type-forwarding-cpp-cli)"},{"pos":[1450,1536],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Managing references in a project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project)</ept>","source":"[Managing references in a project](/visualstudio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project)"}]}
