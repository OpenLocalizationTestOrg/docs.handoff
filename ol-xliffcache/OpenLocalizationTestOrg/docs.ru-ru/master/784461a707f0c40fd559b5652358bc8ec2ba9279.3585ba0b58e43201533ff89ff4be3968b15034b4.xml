These start with interactive lessons\nthat you can run in your browser.\n\nThe first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll\nlearn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings,\nnumbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing and running code\nwithin minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of\nprogramming or the C# language.\n\nAll the introductory tutorials following the Hello World lesson are available using\nthe online browser experience or [in your own local development\nenvironment](local-environment.md). At the end of each tutorial, you decide if you want to continue\nwith the next lesson online or on your own machine. There are links\nto help you set up your environment and continue with the next tutorial\non your machine.\n\n## [Hello world](hello-world.yml)\n\nIn the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) tutorial, you'll create the most basic\nC# program. You'll explore the `string` type and how to work with text.\n\n## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml)\n\nIn the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) tutorial, you'll learn\nhow computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different\nnumeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform\nmathematical calculations using C#. This tutorial is also available\n[to run locally on your machine](numbers-in-csharp-local.md).\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) lesson.\n\n## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml)\n\nThe [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops.yml) tutorial teaches the basics of selecting\ndifferent paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the\nbasics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose\ndifferent actions. This tutorial is also available\n[to run locally on your machine](branches-and-loops-local.md).\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) and\n[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp.yml) lessons.\n\n## [List collection](list-collection.yml)\n\nThe [List collection](list-collection.yml) lesson gives you\na tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists. This tutorial is also\navailable [to run locally on your machine](arrays-and-collections.md).\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the lessons listed above.\n\n## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)\n\nThis final tutorial is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.\nYou'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you've finished the online introductory tutorials, and you've installed [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).","nodes":[{"pos":[4,181],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Introduction to C#
