(Member Access) (Entity SQL)\nThe dot operator (.) is the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] member access operator. You use the member access operator to yield the value of a property or field of an instance of structural conceptual model type.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \nexpression.identifier  \n```  \n  \n## Arguments  \n `expression`  \n An instance of a structural conceptual model type.  \n  \n `identifier`  \n A property or field that belongs to an object instance.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The dot (.) operator may be used to extract fields from a record, similar to extracting properties of a complex or entity type. For example, if n of type Name is a member of type Person, and p is an instance of type Person, then p.n is a legal member access expression that yields a value of type Name.  \n  \n `select p.Name.FirstName from LOB.Person as p`  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":".
