You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31043  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).  \n  \n2.  If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Structure demoStruct  \n        Public demoArray() As Integer  \n    End Structure  \n    Sub useStruct()  \n        Dim struct As demoStruct  \n        ReDim struct.demoArray(9)  \n        Struct.demoArray(2) = 777  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)\n- [How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,237],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31043\"\n  - \"bc31043\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31043\"\nms.assetid: 5bd90c71-1b78-444b-91e1-4789451ef085","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","pos":[0,76]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[244,320],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","linkify":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"An array in a structure is declared with an initial size.","pos":[321,378]},{"content":"You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.","pos":[379,482]},{"pos":[489,510],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31043","source":"**Error ID:** BC31043"},{"pos":[519,540],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).","pos":[550,614]},{"content":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ReDim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)</ept> when your code is running.","pos":[624,823],"source":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running."},{"content":"The following example illustrates this.","pos":[824,863]},{"pos":[1125,1133],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1137,1220],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Arrays<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)"},{"pos":[1223,1352],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Declare a Structure<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)"}]}
