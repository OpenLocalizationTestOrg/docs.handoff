The control displays a calendar: a grid containing the numbered days of the month, arranged in columns underneath the days of the week, with the selected range of dates highlighted. You can select a different month by clicking the arrow buttons on either side of the month caption. Unlike the similar <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control, you can select more than one date with this control. For more information about the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control, see [DateTimePicker Control](datetimepicker-control-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n## Configuring the MonthCalendar Control  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control's appearance is highly configurable. By default, today's date is displayed as circled, and is also noted at the bottom of the grid. You can change this feature by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.ShowToday%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.ShowTodayCircle%2A> properties to `false`. You can also add week numbers to the calendar by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.ShowWeekNumbers%2A> property to `true`. By setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.CalendarDimensions%2A> property, you can have multiple months displayed horizontally and vertically. By default, Sunday is shown as the first day of the week, but any day can be designated using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.FirstDayOfWeek%2A> property.  \n  \n You can also set certain dates to be displayed in bold on a one-time basis, annually, or monthly, by adding <xref:System.DateTime> objects to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.BoldedDates%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.AnnuallyBoldedDates%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.MonthlyBoldedDates%2A> properties. For more information, see [How to: Display Specific Days in Bold with the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](display-specific-days-in-bold-with-wf-monthcalendar-control.md).  \n  \n The key property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar> control is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.SelectionRange%2A>, the range of dates selected in the control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.SelectionRange%2A> value cannot exceed the maximum number of days that can be selected, set in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.MaxSelectionCount%2A> property. The earliest and latest dates the user can select are determined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.MaxDate%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar.MinDate%2A> properties.  \n
