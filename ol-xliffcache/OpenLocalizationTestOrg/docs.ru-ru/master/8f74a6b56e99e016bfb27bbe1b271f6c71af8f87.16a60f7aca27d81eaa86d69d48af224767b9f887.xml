This property designates where your control resides in the form. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property can be set to the following values:  \n  \n|Setting|Effect on your control|  \n|-------------|----------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Bottom>|Docks to the bottom of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>|Fills all remaining space in the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Left>|Docks to the left side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.None>|Does not dock anywhere, and it appears at the location specified by its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Location%2A>.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Right>|Docks to the right side of the form.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Top>|Docks to the top of the form.|  \n  \n These values can also be set in code. For more information, see [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms](how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu.
