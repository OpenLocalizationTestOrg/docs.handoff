This topic describes how to do this.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When adding activities, make sure that the desired version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] is set. Changing the target version of the workflow after activities are added will cause the workflow to fail validation.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  Opening existing workflows in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] that have .Net Framework 3.5 activities will cause an error at `this.SetValue()`. In order to open projects created with previous versions of the .Net Framework, first open a blank workflow in the designer and add a .Net Framework 3.5 activity.  \n  \n## To create a .NET Framework  3.0 or 3.5 project with Visual Studio 2010  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Select **File**, **New**, **Project**.  \n  \n3.  In the drop-down list at the top of the dialog box, select the desired version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  \n  \n## To upgrade the targeted version of the .NET Framework  \n  \n1.  Right-click the project in Solution Explorer, and select **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Target Framework** drop-down list, select the desired version.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,108],"content":"Writing Projects Targeting the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 in Visual Studio 2010 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Writing Projects Targeting the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 in Visual Studio 2010 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,96]}]},{"pos":[373,452],"content":"Writing Projects Targeting the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 in Visual Studio 2010","linkify":"Writing Projects Targeting the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 in Visual Studio 2010","nodes":[{"content":"Writing Projects Targeting the .NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 in Visual Studio 2010","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"You can use <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)]</ph> to create projects that target the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> version 3.0 or 3.5.","pos":[453,631],"source":"You can use [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] to create projects that target the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version 3.0 or 3.5."},{"content":"This topic describes how to do this.","pos":[632,668]},{"pos":[676,936],"content":"[!NOTE]\n When adding activities, make sure that the desired version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] is set.
