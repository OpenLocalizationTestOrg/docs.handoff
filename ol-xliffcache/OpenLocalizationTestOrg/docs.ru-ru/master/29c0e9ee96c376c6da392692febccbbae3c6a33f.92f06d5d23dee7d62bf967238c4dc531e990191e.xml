There are three ways to represent a **DataSet** relation within an XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema:  \n  \n-   Specify nested complex types.  \n  \n-   Use the **msdata:Relationship** annotation.  \n  \n-   Specify an **xs:keyref** without the **msdata:ConstraintOnly** annotation.  \n  \n## Nested Complex Types  \n Nested complex type definitions in a schema indicate the parent-child relationships of the elements. The following XML Schema fragment shows that **OrderDetail** is a child element of the **Order** element.  \n  \n```xml  \n<xs:element name=\"Order\">  \n  <xs:complexType>  \n     <xs:sequence>          \n       <xs:element name=\"OrderDetail\" />  \n           <xs:complexType>               \n           </xs:complexType>  \n     </xs:sequence>  \n  </xs:complexType>  \n</xs:element>  \n```  \n  \n The XML Schema mapping process creates tables in the **DataSet** that correspond to the nested complex types in the schema. It also creates additional columns that are used as parent**-**child columns for the generated tables. Note that these parent**-**child columns specify relationships, which is not the same as specifying primary key/foreign key constraints.  \n  \n## msdata:Relationship Annotation  \n The **msdata:Relationship** annotation allows you to explicitly specify parent-child relationships between elements in the schema that are not nested. The following example shows the structure of the **Relationship** element.  \n  \n```xml  \n<msdata:Relationship name=\"CustOrderRelationship\"    \nmsdata:parent=\"\"    \nmsdata:child=\"\"    \nmsdata:parentkey=\"\"    \nmsdata:childkey=\"\" />  \n```  \n  \n The attributes of the **msdata:Relationship** annotation identify the elements involved in the parent-child relationship, as well as the **parentkey** and **childkey** elements and attributes involved in the relationship. The mapping process uses this information to generate tables in the **DataSet** and to create the primary key/foreign key relationship between these tables.  \n  \n For example, the following schema fragment specifies **Order** and **OrderDetail** elements at the same level (not nested). The schema specifies an **msdata:Relationship** annotation, which specifies the parent-child relationship between these two elements. In this case, an explicit relationship must be specified using the **msdata:Relationship** annotation.  \n  \n```xml  \n <xs:element name=\"MyDataSet\" msdata:IsDataSet=\"true\">  \n  <xs:complexType>  \n    <xs:choice maxOccurs=\"unbounded\">  \n        <xs:element name=\"OrderDetail\">  \n          <xs:complexType>  \n  \n          </xs:complexType>  \n       </xs:element>  \n       <xs:element name=\"Order\">  \n          <xs:complexType>  \n  \n          </xs:complexType>  \n       </xs:element>  \n    </xs:choice>  \n  </xs:complexType>  \n</xs:element>  \n   <xs:annotation>  \n     <xs:appinfo>  \n       <msdata:Relationship name=\"OrdOrdDetailRelation\"  \n          msdata:parent=\"Order\"  \n          msdata:child=\"OrderDetail\"   \n          msdata:parentkey=\"OrderNumber\"  \n          msdata:childkey=\"OrderNo\"/>  \n     </xs:appinfo>  \n  </xs:annotation>  \n```  \n  \n The mapping process uses the **Relationship** element to create a parent-child relationship between the **OrderNumber** column in the **Order** table and the **OrderNo** column in the **OrderDetail** table in the **DataSet**. The mapping process only specifies the relationship; it does not automatically specify any constraints on the values in these columns, as do the primary key/foreign key constraints in relational databases.  \n  \n### In This Section  \n [Map Implicit Relations Between Nested Schema
