The runtime attempts to marshal this `VARIANT` to an object and activates the MDA if the `VARIANT` is not valid. Examples of invalid `VARIANT`S include a `VARIANT` with `VARTYPE` VT_EMPTY &#124; VT_BYREF or a `VARIANT` with `VARTYPE` VT_VARIANT.  \n  \n## Resolution  \n The native or unmanaged code passing the `VARIANT` must ensure that the `VARIANT` is correctly formed and initialized.  \n  \n## Effect on the Runtime  \n The MDA has no effect on the runtime's behavior.  \n  \n## Output  \n An MDA message indicating that the runtime detected an invalid `VARIANT` passed to managed code by an unmanaged module.  \n  \n## Configuration  \n  \n```  \n<mdaConfig>  \n  <assistants>  \n    <invalidVariant />  \n  </assistants>  \n</mdaConfig>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.MarshalAsAttribute>   \n [Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)   \n [Interop Marshaling](../../../docs/framework/interop/interop-marshaling.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,47],"content":"invalidVariant MDA | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"invalidVariant MDA | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[624,642],"content":"invalidVariant MDA","linkify":"invalidVariant MDA","nodes":[{"content":"invalidVariant MDA","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[643,822],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`invalidVariant`</ph> managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when an invalid <ph id=\"ph2\">`VARIANT`</ph> structure is encountered during a call from native or unmanaged code to managed code.","source":"The `invalidVariant` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated when an invalid `VARIANT` structure is encountered during a call from native or unmanaged code to managed code."},{"pos":[831,839],"content":"Symptoms","linkify":"Symptoms","nodes":[{"content":"Symptoms","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[843,968],"content":"Unexpected behavior during a transition between native and managed code involving the marshaling of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`VARIANT`</ph> to an object.","source":"Unexpected behavior during a transition between native and managed code involving the marshaling of a `VARIANT` to an object."},{"pos":[977,982],"content":"Cause","linkify":"Cause","nodes":[{"content":"Cause","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"Native code is passing a malformed <ph id=\"ph1\">`VARIANT`</ph> structure to managed code.","pos":[986,1057],"source":"Native code is passing a malformed `VARIANT` structure to managed code."},{"content":"The runtime attempts to marshal this <ph id=\"ph1\">`VARIANT`</ph> to an object and activates the MDA if the <ph id=\"ph2\">`VARIANT`</ph> is not valid.","pos":[1059,1171],"source":"  The runtime attempts to marshal this `VARIANT` to an object and activates the MDA if the `VARIANT` is not valid."},{"content":"Examples of invalid <ph id=\"ph1\">`VARIANT`</ph>S include a <ph id=\"ph2\">`VARIANT`</ph> with <ph id=\"ph3\">`VARTYPE`</ph> VT_EMPTY &amp;#124;
