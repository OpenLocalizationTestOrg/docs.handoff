The sample consists of a client Web Forms application accessible from a browser and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  \n  \n The service implements a contract that defines a request-reply communication pattern. The contract is defined by the `IWeatherService` interface, which exposes an operation named `GetWeatherData`. This operation accepts an array of cities and returns an array of `WeatherData` objects that represent the high and low forecasted temperature for a city.  \n  \n On the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] client .aspx page, a DataGrid Web control is defined, which contains the graphical representation of the data returned by the service. Code on the .aspx page calls the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service for weather data and returns the data to an array of `WeatherData` objects. The DataGrid specifies where to get its data from by setting its `DataSource` property to that array. The data binding occurs with a call to the DataGrid's `DataBind` method. All of this code is contained inside the .`aspx` page's `Page_Load` method, so every time the user refreshes the browser page, the data is updated in the DataGrid.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  This sample's client is a Web site that runs under a development Web server. To launch the development Web server, type the following at the command prompt: \"`%SystemDrive%\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared\\DevServer\\9.0\\WebDev.WebServer.EXE\" /port:8000 /path:<WebFormsSamplePath>\\CS\\client /vpath:/client`. Then browse to http://localhost:8000/client. To run this sample across computers, replace all references to `localhost` in the client's Web.config file with the computer name of the server.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
