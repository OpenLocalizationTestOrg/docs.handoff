The **WebPermission** class controls an application's right to request data from a URI or to serve a URI to the Internet. The **SocketPermission** class controls an application's right to use a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> to accept data on a local port or to contact remote devices using a transport protocol at another address, based on the host, port number, and transport protocol of the socket.  \n  \n Which permission class you use depends on your application type. Applications that use <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and its descendants should use the **WebPermission** class to manage permissions. Applications that use socket-level access should use the **SocketPermission** class to manage permissions.  \n  \n **WebPermission** and **SocketPermission** define two permissions: accept and connect. Accept grants the application the right to answer an incoming connection from another party. Connect grants the application the right to initiate a connection to another party.  \n  \n For **SocketPermission** instances, accept means that an application can accept incoming connections on a local transport address; connect means that an application can connect to some remote (or local) transport address.  \n  \n For **WebPermission** instances, accept means that an application can export the URI controlled by the **WebPermission** to the world; connect means that an application can access that URI (whether it is remote or local).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Security](../../../docs/standard/security/index.md)   \n [Security in Network Programming](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/security-in-network-programming.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,846],"nodes":[{"content":"Web and Socket Permissions | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"Web and Socket Permissions | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Web and Socket Permissions | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,43]}]}],"pos":[6,52],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Web and Socket Permissions | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\n  - \"CSharp\"\n  - \"C++\"\n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Networking\"\n  - \"positions [.NET Framework], accepting\"\n  - \"sockets, permissions\"\n  - \"network, permissions\"\n  - \"Internet, permissions\"\n  - \"Network Resources\"\n  - \"SocketPermission class, about SocketPermission class\"\n  - \"positions [.NET Framework], connecting\"\n  - \"WebPermission class, about WebPermission class\"\n  - \"permissions [.NET Framework], sockets\"\n  - \"security [.NET Framework], Internet\"\n  - \"positions [.NET Framework], granting\"\nms.assetid: d51ad8cb-03ae-4a51-bfcd-cfcf6b98afa9\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: \"mcleblanc\"\nms.author: \"markl\"\nmanager: \"markl\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[853,879],"content":"Web and Socket Permissions","linkify":"Web and Socket Permissions","nodes":[{"content":"Web and Socket Permissions","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Internet security for applications using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net&gt;</ph> namespace is provided by the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebPermission&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Net.SocketPermission&gt;</ph> classes.","pos":[880,1051],"source":"Internet security for applications using the <xref:System.Net> namespace is provided by the <xref:System.Net.WebPermission> and <xref:System.Net.SocketPermission> classes."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>WebPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class controls an application's right to request data from a URI or to serve a URI to the Internet.","pos":[1052,1173],"source":" The **WebPermission** class controls an application's right to request data from a URI or to serve a URI to the Internet."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SocketPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class controls an application's right to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket&gt;</ph> to accept data on a local port or to contact remote devices using a transport protocol at another address, based on the host, port number, and transport protocol of the socket.","pos":[1174,1455],"source":" The **SocketPermission** class controls an application's right to use a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> to accept data on a local port or to contact remote devices using a transport protocol at another address, based on the host, port number, and transport protocol of the socket."},{"content":"Which permission class you use depends on your application type.","pos":[1462,1526]},{"content":"Applications that use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest&gt;</ph> and its descendants should use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>WebPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class to manage permissions.","pos":[1527,1659],"source":" Applications that use <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and its descendants should use the **WebPermission** class to manage permissions."},{"content":"Applications that use socket-level access should use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SocketPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class to manage permissions.","pos":[1660,1766],"source":" Applications that use socket-level access should use the **SocketPermission** class to manage permissions."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>WebPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>SocketPermission<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> define two permissions: accept and connect.","pos":[1773,1859],"source":"**WebPermission** and **SocketPermission** define two permissions: accept and connect."},{"content":"Accept grants the application the right to answer an incoming connection from another party.","pos":[1860,1952]},{"content":"Connect grants the application the right to initiate a connection to another party.","pos":[1953,2036]},{"pos":[2043,2264],"content":"For <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SocketPermission<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> instances, accept means that an application can accept incoming connections on a local transport address;
