Often localizers need to resize and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called `automatic layout`.  \n  \n## Example  \n\nThe following two [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] examples create applications that instantiate a button; one with English text and one with Spanish text. Notice that the code is the same except for the text; the button adjusts to fit the text.\n\n[!code-xaml[LocalizationBtn_snip#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn_snip/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n[!code-xaml[LocalizationBtn#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the output of the code samples with auto-resizable buttons:\n  \n ![The same button with text in different languages](./media/use-automatic-layout-overview/auto-resizable-button.png)  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Use Automatic Layout Overview](use-automatic-layout-overview.md)\n- [Use a Grid for Automatic Layout](how-to-use-a-grid-for-automatic-layout.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,260],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Button controls [WPF], creating with automatic layout\"\n  - \"automatic layout [WPF], creating buttons\"\nms.assetid: 96c206d0-9e77-4784-9d2d-5045aed2021c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[267,314],"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","linkify":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"This example describes how to use the automatic layout approach to create a button in a localizable application.","pos":[315,427]},{"content":"Localization of a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> can be a time consuming process.","pos":[434,550],"source":"Localization of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process."},{"content":"Often localizers need to resize and reposition elements in addition to translating text.","pos":[551,639]},{"content":"In the past each language that a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> was adapted for required adjustment.","pos":[640,777],"source":" In the past each language that a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment."},{"content":"Now with the capabilities of <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment.","pos":[778,947],"source":" Now with the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment."},{"content":"The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called <ph id=\"ph1\">`automatic layout`</ph>.","pos":[948,1063],"source":" The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called `automatic layout`."},{"pos":[1072,1079],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following two <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> examples create applications that instantiate a button; one with English text and one with Spanish text.","pos":[1083,1275],"source":"The following two [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] examples create applications that instantiate a button; one with English text and one with Spanish text."},{"content":"Notice that the code is the same except for the text; the button adjusts to fit the text.","pos":[1276,1365]},{"content":"The following graphic shows the output of the code samples with auto-resizable buttons:","pos":[1602,1689]},{"content":"The same button with text in different languages","pos":[1696,1744]},{"pos":[1819,1827],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1831,1896],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Use Automatic Layout Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](use-automatic-layout-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Use Automatic Layout Overview](use-automatic-layout-overview.md)"},{"pos":[1899,1975],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Use a Grid for Automatic Layout<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-use-a-grid-for-automatic-layout.md)</ept>","source":"[Use a Grid for Automatic Layout](how-to-use-a-grid-for-automatic-layout.md)"}]}
