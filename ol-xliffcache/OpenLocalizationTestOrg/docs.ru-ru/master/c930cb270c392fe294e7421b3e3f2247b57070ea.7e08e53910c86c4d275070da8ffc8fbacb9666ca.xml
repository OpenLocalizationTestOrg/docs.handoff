(When using a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601?displayProperty=fullName> object to invoke a service you can use the event-driven asynchronous calling model. For more information, see [How to: Call Service Operations Asynchronously](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-call-wcf-service-operations-asynchronously.md). For more information about the event-based asynchronous calling model, see [Multithreaded Programming with the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/multithreaded-programming-with-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md).)  \n  \n The service in this topic implements the `ICalculator` interface. The client can call the operations on this interface asynchronously, which means that operations like `Add` are split into two methods, `BeginAdd` and `EndAdd`, the former of which initiates the call and the latter of which retrieves the result when the operation completes. For an example showing how to implement an operation asynchronously in a service, see [How to: Implement an Asynchronous Service Operation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-implement-an-asynchronous-service-operation.md). For details about synchronous and asynchronous operations, see [Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/synchronous-and-asynchronous-operations.md).  \n  \n## Procedure  \n  \n#### To call WCF service operations asynchronously  \n  \n1.  Run the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) tool with the `/async` option as shown in the following command.  \n  \n    ```  \n    svcutil /n:http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples,Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples http://localhost:8000/servicemodelsamples/service/mex /a  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     This generates an asynchronous client version of the service contract for the operation.  \n  \n2.  Create a callback function to be called when the asynchronous operation is complete, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_How_To_CF_Async#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_how_to_cf_async/cs/client.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[C_How_To_CF_Async#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_how_to_cf_async/vb/client.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  To access a service operation asynchronously, create the client and call the `Begin[Operation]` (for example, `BeginAdd`) and specify a callback function, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_How_To_CF_Async#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_how_to_cf_async/cs/client.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[C_How_To_CF_Async#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_how_to_cf_async/vb/client.vb#3)]  \n  \n     When the callback function executes, the client calls `End<operation>` (for example, `EndAdd`) to retrieve the result.  \n  \n## Example  \n The service that is used with the client code that is used in the preceding procedure implements the `ICalculator` interface as shown in the following code. On the service side, the `Add` and `Subtract` operations of the contract are invoked synchronously by the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] run time, even though the preceding client steps are invoked asynchronously on the client. The `Multiply` and `Divide` operations are used to invoke the service asynchronously on the service side, even if the client invokes them synchronously. This example sets the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.AsyncPattern%2A> property to `true`. This property setting, in combination with the implementation of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] asynchronous pattern, tells the run time to invoke the operation asynchronously.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[C_How_To_CF_Async#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_how_to_cf_async/cs/service.cs#4)]\n
