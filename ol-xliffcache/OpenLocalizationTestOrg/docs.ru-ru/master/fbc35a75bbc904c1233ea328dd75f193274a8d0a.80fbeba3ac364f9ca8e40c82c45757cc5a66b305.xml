The syntax checking by the compiler does not validate that you typed in a correct GUID, but it does check for the right number of digits and delimiters, and that the digits are hexadecimal. Likewise, it verifies that the checksum contains an even number of digits, and that the digits are hexadecimal.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example generates CS1695.  \n  \n```  \n// CS1695.cs  \n  \n#pragma checksum \"12345\"  // CS1695  \n  \npublic class Test  \n{  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1695 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1695 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[578,611],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1695","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1695","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1695","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Invalid #pragma checksum syntax; should be #pragma checksum \"filename\" \"{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\" \"XXXX...\"","pos":[612,733]},{"content":"You should rarely encounter this error since the checksum is generally inserted at run time if you are generating code by means of the Code Dom API.","pos":[740,888]},{"content":"However, if you were to type in this <ph id=\"ph1\">`#pragma`</ph> statement and mistype either the GUID or checksum, you would get this error.","pos":[895,1018],"source":"However, if you were to type in this `#pragma` statement and mistype either the GUID or checksum, you would get this error."},{"content":"The syntax checking by the compiler does not validate that you typed in a correct GUID, but it does check for the right number of digits and delimiters, and that the digits are hexadecimal.","pos":[1019,1208]},{"content":"Likewise, it verifies that the checksum contains an even number of digits, and that the digits are hexadecimal.","pos":[1209,1320]},{"pos":[1329,1336],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example generates CS1695.","pos":[1340,1379]}]}
