For example, mydll.dll says that type `A` exists inside yourdll.dll, but no such type exists inside yourdll.dll. One possible cause of this error is that the version of yourdll.dll you are using is too old and `A` has not yet been defined.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS1684.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// CS1684_a.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /keyfile:CS1684.key  \npublic class A {  \n   public void Test() {}  \n}  \n  \npublic class C2 {}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// CS1684_b.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /r:cs1684_a.dll  \n// post-build command: del /f CS1684_a.dll  \nusing System;  \npublic class Ref   \n{  \n   public static A GetA() { return new A(); }  \n   public static C2 GetC() { return new C2(); }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n We now rebuild the first assembly, leaving out the definition of the class C2 not to be defined in the recompilation.  \n  \n```  \n// CS1684_c.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /keyfile:CS1684.key /out:CS1684_a.dll  \npublic class A {  \n   public void Test() {}  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n This module references the second module by means of the identifier `Ref`. But the second module contains a reference to the class `C2`, which no longer exists because of the compilation in the previous step, and therefore the CS1684 error message is returned from the compilation of this module.  \n  \n```  \n// CS1684_d.cs  \n// compile with: /reference:cs1684_a.dll /reference:cs1684_b.dll  \n// CS1684 expected  \nclass Tester  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n      Ref.GetA().Test();  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1684 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1684 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[578,611],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1684","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1684","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1684","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Reference to type 'Type Name' claims it is defined in 'Namespace', but it could not be found","pos":[612,704]},{"content":"This error can be caused by a reference inside one namespace referring to a type that it says exists inside a second namespace, but the type does not exist.","pos":[711,867]},{"content":"For example, mydll.dll says that type <ph id=\"ph1\">`A`</ph> exists inside yourdll.dll, but no such type exists inside yourdll.dll.","pos":[868,980],"source":" For example, mydll.dll says that type `A` exists inside yourdll.dll, but no such type exists inside yourdll.dll."},{"content":"One possible cause of this error is that the version of yourdll.dll you are using is too old and <ph id=\"ph1\">`A`</ph> has not yet been defined.","pos":[981,1107],"source":" One possible cause of this error is that the version of yourdll.dll you are using is too old and `A` has not yet been defined."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1684.","pos":[1114,1152]},{"pos":[1161,1168],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1338,1345],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1624,1631],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"We now rebuild the first assembly, leaving out the definition of the class C2 not to be defined in the recompilation.","pos":[1635,1752]},{"pos":[1916,1923],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This module references the second module by means of the identifier <ph id=\"ph1\">`Ref`</ph>.","pos":[1927,2001],"source":"This module references the second module by means of the identifier `Ref`."},{"content":"But the second module contains a reference to the class <ph id=\"ph1\">`C2`</ph>, which no longer exists because of the compilation in the previous step, and therefore the CS1684 error message is returned from the compilation of this module.","pos":[2002,2223],"source":" But the second module contains a reference to the class `C2`, which no longer exists because of the compilation in the previous step, and therefore the CS1684 error message is returned from the compilation of this module."}]}
