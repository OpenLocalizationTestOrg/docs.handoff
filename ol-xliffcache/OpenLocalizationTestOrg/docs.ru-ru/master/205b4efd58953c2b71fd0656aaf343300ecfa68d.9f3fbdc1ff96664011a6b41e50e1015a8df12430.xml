The Properties object exposes all of the default settings for the project via the Properties.Settings.Default member.  \n  \n### To Read Settings at Run Time with C#  \n  \n-   Access the appropriate setting via the Properties.Settings.Default member. The following example shows how to assign a setting named `myColor` to a BackColor property. It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named `myColor` of type `System.Drawing.Color`. For information about creating a Settings file, see [How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n    ```  \n    // C#  \n    this.BackColor = Properties.Settings.Default.myColor;  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)   \n [How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md)   \n [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,575],"nodes":[{"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]}],"pos":[6,67],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C# | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application settings [Windows Forms], reading\"\n  - \"application settings [Windows Forms], run time\"\n  - \"application settings [Windows Forms], C#\"\nms.assetid: dbe8bf09-5e1c-49da-9192-154033d7240b\ncaps.latest.revision: 10\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[582,623],"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","linkify":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Read Settings at Run Time With C#","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"You can read both Application-scoped and User-scoped settings at run time via the Properties object.","pos":[626,726]},{"content":"The Properties object exposes all of the default settings for the project via the Properties.Settings.Default member.","pos":[727,844]},{"pos":[854,890],"content":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","linkify":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","nodes":[{"content":"To Read Settings at Run Time with C#","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"Access the appropriate setting via the Properties.Settings.Default member.","pos":[900,974]},{"content":"The following example shows how to assign a setting named <ph id=\"ph1\">`myColor`</ph> to a BackColor property.","pos":[975,1067],"source":" The following example shows how to assign a setting named `myColor` to a BackColor property."},{"content":"It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named <ph id=\"ph1\">`myColor`</ph> of type <ph id=\"ph2\">`System.Drawing.Color`</ph>.","pos":[1068,1195],"source":" It requires you to have previously created a Settings file containing a setting named `myColor` of type `System.Drawing.Color`."},{"content":"For information about creating a Settings file, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md)</ept>.","pos":[1196,1386],"source":" For information about creating a Settings file, see [How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-new-setting-at-design-time.md)."},{"pos":[1490,1498],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Settings and User Settings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1502,1643],"source":"[Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1647,1797],"source":"[How To: Write User Settings at Run Time with C#](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-write-user-settings-at-run-time-with-csharp.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Application Settings Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1801,1911],"source":"[Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)"}]}
