Within a store, file and directory names are specified with respect to the root of the virtual file system.  \n  \n To create a directory, use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance method. If you specify a subdirectory of an directory that doesn't exist, both directories are created. If you specify a directory that already exists, the method returns without creating a directory, and no exception is thrown. However, if you specify a directory name that contains invalid characters, an <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException> exception is thrown.  \n  \n To create a file, use  the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateFile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method.  \n  \n In the Windows operating system, isolated storage file and directory names are case-insensitive. That is, if you create a file named `ThisFile.txt`, and then create another file named `THISFILE.TXT`, only one file is created. The file name keeps its original casing for display purposes.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example illustrates how to create files and directories in an isolated store.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile>\n- <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream>\n- [Isolated Storage](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,662],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"directories [.NET Framework], isolated storage\"\n  - \"files [.NET Framework], isolated storage\"\n  - \"isolated storage, creating files and directories\"\n  - \"data stores, creating files and directories\"\n  - \"data storage using isolated storage, creating files and directories\"\n  - \"stores, creating files and directories\"\n  - \"storing data using isolated storage, creating files and directories\"\nms.assetid: 2ca4d2a4-809b-4f00-bc08-bf4a64d3a5c3\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","pos":[0,56]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[669,725],"content":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","linkify":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Files and Directories in Isolated Storage","pos":[0,56]}]},{"content":"After you have obtained an isolated store, you can create directories and files for storing data.","pos":[726,823]},{"content":"Within a store, file and directory names are specified with respect to the root of the virtual file system.","pos":[824,931]},{"content":"To create a directory, use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> instance method.","pos":[938,1086],"source":"To create a directory, use the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> instance method."},{"content":"If you specify a subdirectory of an directory that doesn't exist, both directories are created.","pos":[1087,1182]},{"content":"If you specify a directory that already exists, the method returns without creating a directory, and no exception is thrown.","pos":[1183,1307]},{"content":"However, if you specify a directory name that contains invalid characters, an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException&gt;</ph> exception is thrown.","pos":[1308,1464],"source":" However, if you specify a directory name that contains invalid characters, an <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageException> exception is thrown."},{"pos":[1471,1601],"content":"To create a file, use  the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateFile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> method.","source":"To create a file, use  the <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile.CreateFile%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method."},{"content":"In the Windows operating system, isolated storage file and directory names are case-insensitive.","pos":[1608,1704]},{"content":"That is, if you create a file named <ph id=\"ph1\">`ThisFile.txt`</ph>, and then create another file named <ph id=\"ph2\">`THISFILE.TXT`</ph>, only one file is created.","pos":[1705,1833],"source":" That is, if you create a file named `ThisFile.txt`, and then create another file named `THISFILE.TXT`, only one file is created."},{"content":"The file name keeps its original casing for display purposes.","pos":[1834,1895]},{"pos":[1904,1911],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example illustrates how to create files and directories in an isolated store.","pos":[1915,2011]},{"pos":[2302,2310],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2430,2495],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Isolated Storage<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)</ept>","source":"[Isolated Storage](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)"}]}
