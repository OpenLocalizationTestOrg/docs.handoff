Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/data-binding-scenarios.md)  \n Demonstrates [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] data binding scenarios.  \n  \n [Discovery Security Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-security-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement custom channels that compute and verify message signatures using the compact signature format (described in Section 8.2 of the WS-Discovery specification).  \n  \n [Federation Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/federation-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates federated security.  \n  \n [Weakly-typed JSON Serialization (AJAX)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/weakly-typed-json-serialization-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] developers to work with deserialized, arbitrary JSON objects, without creating user-defined types.  \n  \n [Trusted Facade Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/trusted-facade-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to flow caller's identity information from one service to another using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security infrastructure.  \n  \n [Design Patterns: List-Based Publish-Subscribe](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/design-patterns-list-based-publish-subscribe.md)  \n Demonstrates the List-based Publish-Subscribe pattern implemented as a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] program.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,38],"content":"Scenario2 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Scenario2 |
