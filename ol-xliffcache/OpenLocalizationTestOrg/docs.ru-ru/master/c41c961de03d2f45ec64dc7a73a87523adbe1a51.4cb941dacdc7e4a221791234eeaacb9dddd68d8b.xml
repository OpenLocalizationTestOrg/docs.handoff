For more information, see [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30991  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Examine the class definition to determine which member is shared.  \n  \n2.  Eliminate the initialization for that member from the object initializer list.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, `totalCustomers` is a shared member.  \n  \n```  \nPublic Class Customer  \n    Public Shared totalCustomers As Integer  \n    ' Other declarations and method definitions.  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n Because `totalCustomers` is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error.  \n  \n```  \n' This declaration is not valid.  \n' Dim cust As New Customer With { .Name = \"Coho Winery\", _  \n'                                 .totalCustomers = 21 }  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)\n- [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,261],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Member '<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30991\"\n  - \"vbc30991\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30991\"\nms.assetid: 47e832b4-47e3-426e-b88c-5d5568102fde","nodes":[{"content":"Member '<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","nodes":[{"pos":[0,100],"content":"Member '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;membername&gt;</ph>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","source":"Member '<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[268,369],"content":"Member '\\<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","linkify":"Member '\\<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","nodes":[{"content":"Member '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>membername&gt;' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared","pos":[0,101],"source":"Member '\\<membername>' cannot be initialized in an object initializer expression because it is shared"}]},{"content":"Object initializers cannot be used to initialize any member of a class that is declared as shared.","pos":[370,468]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept>.","pos":[469,563],"source":" For more information, see [Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)."},{"pos":[570,591],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30991","source":"**Error ID:** BC30991"},{"pos":[600,621],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Examine the class definition to determine which member is shared.","pos":[631,696]},{"content":"Eliminate the initialization for that member from the object initializer list.","pos":[706,784]},{"pos":[793,800],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[804,866],"content":"In the following example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`totalCustomers`</ph> is a shared member.","source":"In the following example, `totalCustomers` is a shared member."},{"pos":[1021,1137],"content":"Because <ph id=\"ph1\">`totalCustomers`</ph> is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error.","source":"Because `totalCustomers` is shared, trying to set its initial value in an object initializer list causes this error."},{"pos":[1316,1324],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1328,1501],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)"},{"pos":[1504,1571],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept>","source":"[Shared](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)"}]}
