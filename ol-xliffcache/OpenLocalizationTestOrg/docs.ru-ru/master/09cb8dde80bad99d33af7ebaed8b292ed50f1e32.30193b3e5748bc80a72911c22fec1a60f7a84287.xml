The Win32 implementation of `VirtualQuery` retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT VirtualQuery (  \n    [in]  void*    lpAddress,  \n    [out] void*    lpBuffer,  \n    [in]  SIZE_T   dwLength,  \n    [out] SIZE_T*  pResult  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `lpAddress`  \n [in] A pointer to the address in virtual memory to be queried.  \n  \n `lpBuffer`  \n [out] A pointer to a structure that contains information about the specified memory region.  \n  \n `dwLength`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that `lpBuffer` points to.  \n  \n `pResult`  \n [out] A pointer to the number of bytes returned by the information buffer.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`VirtualQuery` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `VirtualQuery` provides information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process. This implementation sets the value of the `pResult` parameter to the number of bytes returned in the information buffer, and returns an HRESULT value. In the Win32 `VirtualQuery` function, the return value is the buffer size. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The operating system's implementation of `VirtualQuery` does not incur deadlock and can run to completion with random threads suspended in user code. Use great caution when implementing a hosted version of this method.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IHostMemoryManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[722,761],"content":"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method","linkify":"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method","nodes":[{"content":"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Serves as a logical wrapper for the corresponding Win32 function.","pos":[762,827]},{"content":"The Win32 implementation of <ph id=\"ph1\">`VirtualQuery`</ph> retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.","pos":[828,968],"source":" The Win32 implementation of `VirtualQuery` retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process."},{"pos":[977,983],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1162,1172],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to the address in virtual memory to be queried.","pos":[1191,1253]},{"content":"[out] A pointer to a structure that contains information about the specified memory region.","pos":[1274,1365]},{"content":"[in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that <ph id=\"ph1\">`lpBuffer`</ph> points to.","pos":[1386,1451],"source":" [in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that `lpBuffer` points to."},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the number of bytes returned by the information buffer.","pos":[1471,1545]},{"pos":[1554,1566],"content":"Return Value","linkify":"Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Return Value","pos":[0,12]}]},{"content":"HRESULT","pos":[1573,1580]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1581,1592]},{"content":"S_OK","pos":[1633,1637]},{"pos":[1638,1675],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`VirtualQuery`</ph> returned successfully.","source":"`VirtualQuery` returned successfully."},{"content":"HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE","pos":[1680,1702]},{"content":"The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.","pos":[1703,1867]},{"content":"HOST_E_TIMEOUT","pos":[1872,1886]},{"content":"The call timed out.","pos":[1887,1906]},{"content":"HOST_E_NOT_OWNER","pos":[1911,1927]},{"content":"The caller does not own the lock.","pos":[1928,1961]},{"content":"HOST_E_ABANDONED","pos":[1966,1982]},{"content":"An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.","pos":[1983,2055]},{"content":"E_FAIL","pos":[2060,2066]},{"content":"An unknown catastrophic failure occurred.","pos":[2067,2108]},{"content":"When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process.","pos":[2109,2186]},{"content":"Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.","pos":[2187,2253]},{"pos":[2263,2270],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`VirtualQuery`</ph> provides information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.","pos":[2274,2385],"source":"`VirtualQuery` provides information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process."},{"content":"This implementation sets the value of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`pResult`</ph> parameter to the number of bytes returned in the information buffer, and returns an HRESULT value.","pos":[2386,2536],"source":" This implementation sets the value of the `pResult` parameter to the number of bytes returned in the information buffer, and returns an HRESULT value."},{"content":"In the Win32 <ph id=\"ph1\">`VirtualQuery`</ph> function, the return value is the buffer size.","pos":[2537,2611],"source":" In the Win32 `VirtualQuery` function, the return value is the buffer size."},{"content":"For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.","pos":[2612,2673]},{"pos":[2681,2915],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The operating system's implementation of `VirtualQuery` does not incur deadlock and can run to completion with random threads suspended in user code.
