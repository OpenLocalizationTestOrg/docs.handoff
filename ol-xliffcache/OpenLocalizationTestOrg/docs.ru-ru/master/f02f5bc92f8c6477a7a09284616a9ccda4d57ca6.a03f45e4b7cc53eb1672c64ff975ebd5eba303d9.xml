For more information about access keys, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md).  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"accept\" button of the form, pressing ENTER chooses the button, even if another control has the focus — except if that other control is another button, a multi-line text box, or a custom control that traps the enter key.  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"cancel\" button of the form, pressing ESC chooses the button, even if another control has the focus.  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A> method to select the button programmatically.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Button Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)   \n [Button Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,475],"nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]}],"pos":[6,71],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
