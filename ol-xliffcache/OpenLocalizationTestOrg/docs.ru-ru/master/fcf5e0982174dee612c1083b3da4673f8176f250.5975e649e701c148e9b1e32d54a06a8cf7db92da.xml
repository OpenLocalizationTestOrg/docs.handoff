Open Visual Studio and select **New Web Site** from the **File** menu.  \n  \n2.  In the **New Web Site** dialog, select from the left pane your desired programming language, then from the right pane, select **ASP.NET Web Service**.  \n  \n3.  Click **Browse** and navigate to the \\CS\\GenericsService subdirectory.  \n  \n4.  Select Service.asmx to open the file in Visual Studio.  \n  \n5.  On the **Build** menu, click **Build Solution**.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The first five steps in this list are optional. The .NET Framework runtime will automatically generate the Web service the first time the service is requested.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The following steps are required to build the sample.  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[fileExplorer](../../../includes/fileexplorer-md.md)] and navigate to the \\CS subdirectory.  \n  \n2.  Right-click the icon for the GenericsService subdirectory, and select **Sharing and Security**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Web Sharing** tab, select **Share this Folder**.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Take note of the virtual directory name that is listed in the **Aliases** pane, because you will need it to run the sample.  \n  \n### To build the sample using Internet Information Services  \n  \n1.  Open the **Internet Information Services** management snap-in and expand **Web Sites**.  \n  \n2.  Left-click **Default Web Site**, select **New**, and then select **Virtual Directory?** to create the **Virtual Directory Creation Wizard**.  \n  \n3.  Click **Next**, enter the public alias for your virtual directory, and click **Next**.  \n  \n4.  Enter the path to the directory where you saved the sample (normally the \\CS\\GenericsService subdirectory) and click **Next**. Click **Next** to finish the wizard.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Take note of the virtual directory name that is listed in the **Alias** pane, because you will need it to run the sample.  \n  \n### To run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open a browser window and select its address bar.  \n  \n2.  Type **http://localhost/[virtual directory]/Service.asmx**, where [virtual directory] represents the virtual directory you created when you built the sample.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The sample displays a default ASP.NET page that contains links to the definition of the Web Service. You can customize the display in addition to modifying the source code for the Web service.
