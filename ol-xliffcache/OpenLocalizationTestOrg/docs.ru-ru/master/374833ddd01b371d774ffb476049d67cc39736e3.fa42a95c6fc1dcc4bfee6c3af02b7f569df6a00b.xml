Normally, you cannot have two versions of a method in a class with the same signature. But with generics, you can specify a generic method that might duplicate another method if it is instantiated with a particular type.  \n  \n## Example  \n When `C<int>` is instantiated, two versions of the method `F` are created with the same signature, so the override in class `D` cannot decide which one to apply the override to.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0462.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0462.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \nclass C<T>   \n{  \n   public virtual void F(T t) {}  \n   public virtual void F(int t) {}  \n}  \n  \nclass D : C<int>   \n{  \n   public override void F(int t) {}   // CS0462  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0462 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0462 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[566,587],"content":"Compiler Error CS0462","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0462","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0462","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"The inherited members 'member1' and 'member2' have the same signature in type 'type', so they cannot be overridden","pos":[588,702]},{"content":"This error arises with the introduction of generics.","pos":[709,761]},{"content":"Normally, you cannot have two versions of a method in a class with the same signature.","pos":[762,848]},{"content":"But with generics, you can specify a generic method that might duplicate another method if it is instantiated with a particular type.","pos":[849,982]},{"pos":[991,998],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1002,1179],"content":"When <ph id=\"ph1\">`C&lt;int&gt;`</ph> is instantiated, two versions of the method <ph id=\"ph2\">`F`</ph> are created with the same signature, so the override in class <ph id=\"ph3\">`D`</ph> cannot decide which one to apply the override to.","source":"When `C<int>` is instantiated, two versions of the method `F` are created with the same signature, so the override in class `D` cannot decide which one to apply the override to."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0462.","pos":[1186,1224]}]}
