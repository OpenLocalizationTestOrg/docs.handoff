Instead, each item is passed from one lazy method to the next. This results in a much smaller memory footprint than an approach that would first take one array of strings, then create a second array of strings that have been converted to uppercase, and finally create a third array of strings where each string has the exclamation points appended to it.  \n  \n The next topic in this tutorial illustrates intermediate materialization:  \n  \n-   [Intermediate Materialization (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/intermediate-materialization.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tutorial: Chaining Queries Together (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/tutorial-chaining-queries-together.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"Chaining Queries Example (C#) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Chaining Queries Example (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[343,372],"content":"Chaining Queries Example (C#)","linkify":"Chaining Queries Example (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"Chaining Queries Example (C#)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"This example builds on the previous example and shows what happens when you chain together two queries that both use deferred execution and lazy evaluation.","pos":[373,529]},{"pos":[538,545],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[549,731],"content":"In this example, another extension method is introduced, <ph id=\"ph1\">`AppendString`</ph>, which appends a specified string onto every string in the source collection, and then yields the new strings.","source":"In this example, another extension method is introduced, `AppendString`, which appends a specified string onto every string in the source collection, and then yields the new strings."},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[1952,1995]},{"content":"In this example, you can see that each extension method operates one at a time for each item in the source collection.","pos":[2248,2366]},{"content":"What should be clear from this example is that even though we have chained together queries that yield collections, no intermediate collections are materialized.","pos":[2373,2534]},{"content":"Instead, each item is passed from one lazy method to the next.","pos":[2535,2597]},{"content":"This results in a much smaller memory footprint than an approach that would first take one array of strings, then create a second array of strings that have been converted to uppercase, and finally create a third array of strings where each string has the exclamation points appended to it.","pos":[2598,2888]},{"content":"The next topic in this tutorial illustrates intermediate materialization:","pos":[2895,2968]},{"pos":[2978,3097],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Intermediate Materialization (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/intermediate-materialization.md)</ept>","source":"[Intermediate Materialization (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/intermediate-materialization.md)"},{"pos":[3106,3114],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[3118,3250],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tutorial: Chaining Queries Together (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/tutorial-chaining-queries-together.md)</ept>","source":"[Tutorial: Chaining Queries Together (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/tutorial-chaining-queries-together.md)"}]}
