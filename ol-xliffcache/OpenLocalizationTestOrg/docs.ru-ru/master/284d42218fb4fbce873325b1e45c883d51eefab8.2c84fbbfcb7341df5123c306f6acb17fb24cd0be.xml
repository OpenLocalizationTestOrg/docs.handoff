It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.  \n  \n The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A> property. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A> property is set to `false`, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A> property is set to `true`, the user cannot select dithered colors. To display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog>\n- [ColorDialog Component](colordialog-component-windows-forms.md)\n- [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component](how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,310],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"ColorDialog\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"color dialog box [Windows Forms], about color dialog box\"\n  - \"ColorDialog component [Windows Forms], about ColorDialog\"\nms.assetid: 6dbdd8f0-f697-4728-bb09-7ea156f6d800","nodes":[{"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[317,363],"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"ColorDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog&gt;</ph> component is a pre-configured dialog box that allows the user to select a color from a palette and to add custom colors to that palette.","pos":[364,558],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> component is a pre-configured dialog box that allows the user to select a color from a palette and to add custom colors to that palette."},{"content":"It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors.","pos":[559,651]},{"content":"Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[652,761]},{"content":"The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[768,882],"source":"The color selected in the dialog box is returned in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.Color%2A> property."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette.","pos":[883,1088],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.AllowFullOpen%2A> property is set to `false`, the \"Define Custom Colors\" button is disabled and the user is restricted to the predefined colors in the palette."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`true`</ph>, the user cannot select dithered colors.","pos":[1089,1220],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog.SolidColorOnly%2A> property is set to `true`, the user cannot select dithered colors."},{"content":"To display the dialog box, you must call its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1221,1328],"source":" To display the dialog box, you must call its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method."},{"pos":[1337,1345],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1391,1454],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ColorDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](colordialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[ColorDialog Component](colordialog-component-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1457,1546],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Dialog-Box Controls and Components<ept id=\"p1\">](dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Dialog-Box Controls and Components](dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1549,1699],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component](how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)"}]}
