By default, only the currently visible part of the form is printed; if a user has resized the form at run time, the image may not print as intended. The following procedure shows how to print the complete client area of a scrollable form, even if the form has been resized.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n### To print the complete client area of a scrollable form  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component will be added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a **Print**`Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.Scrollable)  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, you will not be able to print with the `Scrollable` parameter.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.Print%2A>   \n [PrintForm Component](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/printform-component.md)   \n [How to: Print the Client Area of a Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-the-client-area-of-a-form.md)   \n [How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-client-and-non-client-areas-of-a-form.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,621],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"entire form, printing\"\n  - \"scrollable form, printing\"\nms.assetid: 1196e1cf-b77f-4928-a3e4-85b51ba3787d\ncaps.latest.revision: 15\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"\ntranslation.priority.mt: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,63],"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,63]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[628,674],"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Scrollable Form (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm&gt;</ph> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[675,867],"source":"The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component enables you to quickly print an image of a form without using a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component."},{"content":"By default, only the currently visible part of the form is printed;
