One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim divisor = 3  \n' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(divisor <> 0, number \\ divisor, \"Division by zero\"))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33106  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.  \n  \n-   Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)   \n [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)   \n [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,627],"nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39;
