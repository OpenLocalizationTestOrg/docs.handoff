This number must be greater than zero.  \n  \n `ppCLRTask`  \n [in] An array of `ICLRTask` pointers to associate with the connection identified by `id`. This array must contain at least one member.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`SetConnectionTasks` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred.

[ICLRDebugManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-interface.md) provides three methods, `BeginConnection`, `SetConnectionTasks`, and [EndConnection](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-endconnection-method.md), for associating task lists with identifiers and friendly names.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
