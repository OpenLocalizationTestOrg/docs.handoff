You may need to use a different serial port on your computer.  \n  \n Use the `My.Computer.Ports.OpenSerialPort` method to obtain a reference to the port. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports.OpenSerialPort%2A>.  \n  \n The `Using` block allows the application to close the serial port even if it generates an exception. All code that manipulates the serial port should appear within this block or within a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.WriteLine%2A> method sends the data to the serial port.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#33](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class2.vb#33)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n  \n-   This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`; for more flexibility, the code should allow the user to select the desired serial port from a list of available ports. For more information, see [How to: Show Available Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-show-available-serial-ports.md).  \n  \n This example uses a `Using` block to make sure that the application closes the port even if it throws an exception.
