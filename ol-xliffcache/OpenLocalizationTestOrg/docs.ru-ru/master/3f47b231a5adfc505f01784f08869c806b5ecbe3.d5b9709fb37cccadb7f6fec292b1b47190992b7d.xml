accessor of property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; is not accessible\nA statement attempts to store the value of a property when it does not have access to the property's `Set` procedure.  \n  \n If the [Set Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/set-statement.md) is marked with a more restrictive access level than its [Property Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md), an attempt to set the property value could fail in the following cases:  \n  \n-   The `Set` statement is marked [Private](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md) and the calling code is outside the class or structure in which the property is defined.  \n  \n-   The `Set` statement is marked [Protected](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/protected.md) and the calling code is not in the class or structure in which the property is defined, nor in a derived class.  \n  \n-   The `Set` statement is marked [Friend](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/friend.md) and the calling code is not in the same assembly in which the property is defined.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31102  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you have control of the source code defining the property, consider declaring the `Set` procedure with the same access level as the property itself.  \n  \n-   If you do not have control of the source code defining the property, or you must restrict the `Set` procedure access level more than the property itself, try to move the statement that sets the property value to a region of code that has better access to the property.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Property Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)   \n [How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,112],"content":"&#39;Set&#39;
