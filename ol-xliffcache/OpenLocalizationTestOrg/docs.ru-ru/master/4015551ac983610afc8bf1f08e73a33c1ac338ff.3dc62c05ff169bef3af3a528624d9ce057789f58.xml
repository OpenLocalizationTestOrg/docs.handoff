These exceptions and their error conditions are listed in the following table.  \n  \n|Exception|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ArithmeticException>|A base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations, such as <xref:System.DivideByZeroException> and <xref:System.OverflowException>.|  \n|<xref:System.ArrayTypeMismatchException>|Thrown when an array cannot store a given element because the actual type of the element is incompatible with the actual type of the array.|  \n|<xref:System.DivideByZeroException>|Thrown when an attempt is made to divide an integral value by zero.|  \n|<xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException>|Thrown when an attempt is made to index an array when the index is less than zero or outside the bounds of the array.|  \n|<xref:System.InvalidCastException>|Thrown when an explicit conversion from a base type to an interface or to a derived type fails at runtime.|  \n|<xref:System.NullReferenceException>|Thrown when you attempt to reference an object whose value is [null](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/null.md).|  \n|<xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>|Thrown when an attempt to allocate memory using the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-operator.md) operator fails. This indicates that the memory available to the common language runtime has been exhausted.|  \n|<xref:System.OverflowException>|Thrown when an arithmetic operation in a `checked` context overflows.|  \n|<xref:System.StackOverflowException>|Thrown when the execution stack is exhausted by having too many pending method calls; usually indicates a very deep or infinite recursion.|  \n|<xref:System.TypeInitializationException>|Thrown when a static constructor throws an exception and no compatible `catch` clause exists to catch it.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Exceptions and Exception Handling](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/index.md)   \n [Exception Handling](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/exception-handling.md)   \n [try-catch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md)   \n [try-finally](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-finally.md)   \n [try-catch-finally](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch-finally.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,81],"content":"Compiler-Generated Exceptions (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler-Generated Exceptions (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,69]}]},{"pos":[573,625],"content":"Compiler-Generated Exceptions (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"Compiler-Generated Exceptions (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler-Generated Exceptions (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,52]}]},{"content":"Some exceptions are thrown automatically by the .NET Framework's common language runtime (CLR) when basic operations fail.","pos":[626,748]},{"content":"These exceptions and their error conditions are listed in the following table.","pos":[749,827]},{"content":"Exception","pos":[834,843]},{"content":"Description","pos":[844,855]},{"content":"A base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations, such as <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.DivideByZeroException&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.OverflowException&gt;</ph>.","pos":[932,1081],"source":"A base class for exceptions that occur during arithmetic operations, such as <xref:System.DivideByZeroException> and <xref:System.OverflowException>."},{"content":"Thrown when an array cannot store a given element because the actual type of the element is incompatible with the actual type of the array.","pos":[1127,1266]},{"content":"Thrown when an attempt is made to divide an integral value by zero.","pos":[1307,1374]},{"content":"Thrown when an attempt is made to index an array when the index is less than zero or outside the bounds of the array.","pos":[1418,1535]},{"content":"Thrown when an explicit conversion from a base type to an interface or to a derived type fails at runtime.","pos":[1575,1681]},{"pos":[1723,1845],"content":"Thrown when you attempt to reference an object whose value is <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>null<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/null.md)</ept>.","source":"Thrown when you attempt to reference an object whose value is [null](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/null.md)."},{"content":"Thrown when an attempt to allocate memory using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-operator.md)</ept> operator fails.","pos":[1885,2019],"source":"Thrown when an attempt to allocate memory using the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-operator.md) operator fails."},{"content":"This indicates that the memory available to the common language runtime has been exhausted.","pos":[2020,2111]},{"pos":[2148,2217],"content":"Thrown when an arithmetic operation in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`checked`</ph> context overflows.","source":"Thrown when an arithmetic operation in a `checked` context overflows."},{"content":"Thrown when the execution stack is exhausted by having too many pending method calls;
