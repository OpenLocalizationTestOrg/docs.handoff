You can code in your favorite text editor and produce cross-platform libraries and applications. \n\nIf you're unsure what .NET Core is, or how it relates to other .NET technologies, start with the [What is .NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) overview. Put simply, .NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform, implementation of .NET.\n\n## Create an application\n\nFirst, download and install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/) on your computer.\n\nNext, open a terminal such as **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, or **bash**. Type the following `dotnet` commands to create and run a C# application.\n\n```console\ndotnet new console --output sample1\ndotnet run --project sample1\n```\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\n```console\nHello World!\n```\n\nCongratulations! You've created a simple .NET Core application. You can also use [Visual Studio Code](tutorials/with-visual-studio-code.md), [Visual Studio 2017](tutorials/with-visual-studio.md) (Windows only), or [Visual Studio for Mac](tutorials/using-on-mac-vs.md) (macOS only), to create a .NET Core application.\n\n## Tutorials\n\nYou can get started developing .NET Core applications by following these step-by-step
