The main transports used in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] are HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and named pipes. The topics in this section discuss choosing among these transports, configuring the transport, and setting tuning properties.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] includes additional transports. For information about Message Queuing (also known as MSMQ) transport, see [Queues and Reliable Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/queues-and-reliable-sessions.md). For information about peer-to-peer transport, see [Peer-to-Peer Networking](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-to-peer-networking.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Choosing a Transport](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/choosing-a-transport.md)  \n Describes the three main transports and considerations in selecting one.  \n  \n [Choosing a Message Encoder](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/choosing-a-message-encoder.md)  \n Describes factors to consider when choosing a message-encoding binding element.  \n  \n [Streaming Message Transfer](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/streaming-message-transfer.md)  \n Describes how to configure the transport layer to do streaming.  \n  \n [Configuring HTTP and HTTPS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/configuring-http-and-https.md)  \n Describes how to configure the HTTP and HTTPS transport binding elements.  \n  \n [How to: Replace the WCF URL Reservation with a Restricted Reservation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-replace-the-wcf-url-reservation-with-a-restricted-reservation.md)  \n Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]URL restricted reservations.  \n  \n [Transport Quotas](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-quotas.md)  \n Describes considerations in setting the quotas available in the transport layer.  \n  \n [Working with NATs and Firewalls](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-nats-and-firewalls.md)  \n Describes how to configure the transport layer when messages are sent or received behind a firewall or when network address translation (NAT) is present.  \n  \n [Net.TCP Port Sharing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/net-tcp-port-sharing.md)  \n Describes how to use the Net.TCP Port Sharing component of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].
