To resolve CS0430, compile with **/reference**.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// CS0430_a.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library   \npublic class MyClass {}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n Compiling with **/reference:MyType=cs0430_a.dll** to refer to the DLL created in the previous sample resolves this error. The following sample generates CS0430.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0430_b.cs  \nextern alias MyType;   // CS0430  \npublic class Test   \n{  \n   public static void Main() {}  \n}  \n  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0430 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0430 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[566,587],"content":"Compiler Error CS0430","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0430","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0430","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"The extern alias 'alias' was not specified in a /reference option","pos":[588,653]},{"content":"This error occurs when extern Alias is encountered but Alias was not specified as a reference on the command line.","pos":[660,774]},{"content":"To resolve CS0430, compile with <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/reference<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[775,822],"source":" To resolve CS0430, compile with **/reference**."},{"pos":[831,838],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[941,948],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Compiling with <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/reference:MyType=cs0430_a.dll<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to refer to the DLL created in the previous sample resolves this error.","pos":[952,1073],"source":"Compiling with **/reference:MyType=cs0430_a.dll** to refer to the DLL created in the previous sample resolves this error."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0430.","pos":[1074,1112]}]}
