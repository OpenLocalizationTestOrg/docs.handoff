See [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md).  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40031  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you have control over the source code, change the member name so that it does not begin with an underscore.  \n  \n-   If you require that the member name remain unchanged, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`. You can still mark the assembly as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md)\n- [Visual Basic Naming Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/naming-conventions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,199],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Name <membername> is not CLS-compliant\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc40031\"\n  - \"vbc40031\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC40031\"\nms.assetid: e2b885dc-cbf9-49ff-bbbe-531657ea99f7","nodes":[{"content":"Name <membername> is not CLS-compliant","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Name <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;membername&gt;</ph> is not CLS-compliant","source":"Name <membername> is not CLS-compliant"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[206,245],"content":"Name \\<membername> is not CLS-compliant","linkify":"Name \\<membername> is not CLS-compliant","nodes":[{"content":"Name <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>membername&gt;
