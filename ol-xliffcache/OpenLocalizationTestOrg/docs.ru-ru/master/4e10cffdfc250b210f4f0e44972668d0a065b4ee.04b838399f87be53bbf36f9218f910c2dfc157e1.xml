This can cause undetermined issues because `DllMain` functions typically contain important initialization code.  \n  \n## Cause  \n The `DllMain` function is called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for DLL initialization upon load. If it returns FALSE, it means that DLL initialization failed.  \n  \n## Resolution  \n Analyze the code of the `DllMain` function of the failed DLL and identify the cause of the initialization failure.  \n  \n## Effect on the Runtime  \n This MDA has no effect on the CLR. It only reports data about the return value for `DllMain`.  \n  \n## Output  \n A message indicating that a `DllMain` function, called for reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returned FALSE. Note that this MDA is activated only if `DllMain` is implemented in managed code.  \n  \n## Configuration  \n  \n```  \n<mdaConfig>  \n  <assistants>  \n    <dllMainReturnsFalse />  \n  </assistants>  \n</mdaConfig>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,52],"content":"dllMainReturnsFalse MDA | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"dllMainReturnsFalse MDA | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]},{"pos":[615,638],"content":"dllMainReturnsFalse MDA","linkify":"dllMainReturnsFalse MDA","nodes":[{"content":"dllMainReturnsFalse MDA","pos":[0,23]}]},{"pos":[639,819],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`dllMainReturnsFalse`</ph> managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated if the managed <ph id=\"ph2\">`DllMain`</ph> function of a user assembly, called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returns FALSE.","source":"The `dllMainReturnsFalse` managed debugging assistant (MDA) is activated if the managed `DllMain` function of a user assembly, called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returns FALSE."},{"pos":[828,836],"content":"Symptoms","linkify":"Symptoms","nodes":[{"content":"Symptoms","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> function returned FALSE, indicating that it did not execute properly.","pos":[840,923],"source":"The `DllMain` function returned FALSE, indicating that it did not execute properly."},{"content":"This can cause undetermined issues because <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> functions typically contain important initialization code.","pos":[924,1035],"source":" This can cause undetermined issues because `DllMain` functions typically contain important initialization code."},{"pos":[1044,1049],"content":"Cause","linkify":"Cause","nodes":[{"content":"Cause","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> function is called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for DLL initialization upon load.","pos":[1053,1150],"source":"The `DllMain` function is called with reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH for DLL initialization upon load."},{"content":"If it returns FALSE, it means that DLL initialization failed.","pos":[1151,1212]},{"pos":[1221,1231],"content":"Resolution","linkify":"Resolution","nodes":[{"content":"Resolution","pos":[0,10]}]},{"pos":[1235,1349],"content":"Analyze the code of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> function of the failed DLL and identify the cause of the initialization failure.","source":"Analyze the code of the `DllMain` function of the failed DLL and identify the cause of the initialization failure."},{"pos":[1358,1379],"content":"Effect on the Runtime","linkify":"Effect on the Runtime","nodes":[{"content":"Effect on the Runtime","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"This MDA has no effect on the CLR.","pos":[1383,1417]},{"content":"It only reports data about the return value for <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph>.","pos":[1418,1476],"source":" It only reports data about the return value for `DllMain`."},{"pos":[1485,1491],"content":"Output","linkify":"Output","nodes":[{"content":"Output","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"A message indicating that a <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> function, called for reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returned FALSE.","pos":[1495,1596],"source":"A message indicating that a `DllMain` function, called for reason DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, returned FALSE."},{"content":"Note that this MDA is activated only if <ph id=\"ph1\">`DllMain`</ph> is implemented in managed code.","pos":[1597,1678],"source":" Note that this MDA is activated only if `DllMain` is implemented in managed code."},{"pos":[1687,1700],"content":"Configuration","linkify":"Configuration","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration","pos":[0,13]}]},{"pos":[1818,1826],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1830,1983],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)</ept>","source":"[Diagnosing Errors with Managed Debugging Assistants](../../../docs/framework/debug-trace-profile/diagnosing-errors-with-managed-debugging-assistants.md)"}]}
