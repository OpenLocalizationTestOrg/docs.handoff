It creates the manifest in the same folder in which the executable file is built, typically the bin\\Debug or bin\\Release folder when you use Visual Studio. If you want to supply a custom manifest, for example to specify a requested execution level of highestAvailable or requireAdministrator, use this option to specify the name of the file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This option and the [/win32resource](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/win32resource.md) option are mutually exclusive. If you try to use both options in the same command line, you will get a build error.  \n  \n An application that has no application manifest that specifies a requested execution level will be subject to file/registry virtualization under the User Account Control feature in Windows Vista. For more information about virtualization, see [ClickOnce Deployment on Windows Vista](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-deployment-on-windows-vista).  \n  \n Your application will be subject to virtualization if either of the following conditions is true:  \n  \n1.  You use the `/nowin32manifest` option and you do not provide a manifest in a later build step or as part of a Windows Resource (.res) file by using the `/win32resource` option.  \n  \n2.  You provide a custom manifest that does not specify a requested execution level.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] creates a default .manifest file and stores it in the debug and release directories alongside the executable file. You can view or edit the default app.manifest file by clicking **View UAC Settings** on the **Application** tab in the Project Designer. For more information, see [Application Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/reference/application-page-project-designer-visual-basic).  \n  \n You can provide the application manifest as a custom post-build step or as part of a Win32 resource file by using the `/nowin32manifest` option. Use that same option if you want your application to be subject to file or registry virtualization on Windows Vista. This will prevent the compiler from creating and embedding a default manifest in the PE file.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows the default manifest that the Visual Basic compiler inserts into a PE.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The compiler inserts a standard application name MyApplication.app into the manifest XML. This is a workaround to enable applications to run on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 3.  \n  \n```  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>  \n<assembly xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1\" manifestVersion=\"1.0\">  \n  <assemblyIdentity version=\"1.0.0.0\" name=\"MyApplication.app\"/>  \n  <trustInfo xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2\">  \n    <security>  \n      <requestedPrivileges xmlns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v3\">  \n        <requestedExecutionLevel level=\"asInvoker\"/>  \n      </requestedPrivileges>  \n    </security>  \n  </trustInfo>  \n</assembly>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [/nowin32manifest (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/nowin32manifest.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,687],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"/win32manifest (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"/win32manifest compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"win32manifest compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"-win32manifest compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: 9e3191b4-90db-41c8-966a-28036fd20005\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","nodes":[{"content":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[694,723],"content":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic)","linkify":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"/win32manifest (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Identifies a user-defined Win32 application manifest file to be embedded into a project's portable executable (PE) file.","pos":[724,844]},{"pos":[853,859],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[910,919],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Term","pos":[926,930]},{"content":"Definition","pos":[931,941]},{"content":"The path of the custom manifest file.","pos":[969,1006]},{"pos":[1016,1023],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"By default, the Visual Basic compiler embeds an application manifest that specifies a requested execution level of asInvoker.","pos":[1027,1152]},{"content":"It creates the manifest in the same folder in which the executable file is built, typically the bin\\Debug or bin\\Release folder when you use Visual Studio.","pos":[1153,1308]},{"content":"If you want to supply a custom manifest, for example to specify a requested execution level of highestAvailable or requireAdministrator, use this option to specify the name of the file.","pos":[1309,1494]},{"pos":[1502,1737],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This option and the [/win32resource](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/win32resource.md) option are mutually exclusive.
