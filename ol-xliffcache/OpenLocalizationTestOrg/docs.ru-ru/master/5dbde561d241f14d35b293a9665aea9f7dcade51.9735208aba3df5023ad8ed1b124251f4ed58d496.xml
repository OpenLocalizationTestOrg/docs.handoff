Increasing the work a small amount increases the performance of the <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> compared to a standard lock. However, there is a point at which a SpinLock becomes more expensive than a standard lock. You can use the concurrency profiling functionality in the profiling tools to see which type of lock provides better performance in your program.

In such cases, on multi-core computers it can be efficient for the blocked thread to spin for a few cycles until the lock is released. By spinning, the thread does not become blocked, which is a CPU-intensive process. <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock> will stop spinning under certain conditions to prevent starvation of logical processors or priority inversion on systems with Hyper-Threading.  \n  \n This example uses the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.Queue%601?displayProperty=fullName> class, which requires user synchronization for multi-threaded access. In applications that target the .NET Framework version 4, another option is to use the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentQueue%601?displayProperty=fullName>, which does not require any user locks.  \n  \n Note the use of `false` (`False` in Visual Basic) in the call to <xref:System.Threading.SpinLock.Exit%2A>. This provides the best performance. Specify `true` (`True`)on IA64 architectures to use the memory fence, which flushes the write buffers to ensure that the lock is now available for other threads to exit.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
