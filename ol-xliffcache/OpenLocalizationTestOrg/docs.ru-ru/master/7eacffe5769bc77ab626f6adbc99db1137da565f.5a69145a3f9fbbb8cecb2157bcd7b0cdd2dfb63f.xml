In this case, the debugger receives the [ICorDebugUnmanagedCallback::DebugEvent](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugunmanagedcallback-debugevent-method.md) callback with its `fOutOfBand` parameter set to `false`.  \n  \n An *out-of-band event* is an unmanaged event during which interaction with the managed state of the process is impossible while the process is stopped due to the event. In this case, the debugger receives the `ICorDebugUnmanagedCallback::DebugEvent` callback with its `fOutOfBand` parameter set to `true`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,478],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ICorDebugController::Continue Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  - \"ICorDebugController.Continue\"\napi_location: \n  - \"mscordbi.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"ICorDebugController::Continue\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Continue method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\n  - \"ICorDebugController::Continue method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\nms.assetid: 8684cd06-ad3e-48ef-832e-15320e1f43a2\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[485,521],"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","linkify":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugController::Continue Method","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[522,676],"content":"Resumes execution of managed threads after a call to <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Stop Method<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugcontroller-stop-method.md)</ept>.","source":"Resumes execution of managed threads after a call to [Stop Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugcontroller-stop-method.md)."},{"pos":[685,691],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[770,780],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] Set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> if continuing from an out-of-band event;
