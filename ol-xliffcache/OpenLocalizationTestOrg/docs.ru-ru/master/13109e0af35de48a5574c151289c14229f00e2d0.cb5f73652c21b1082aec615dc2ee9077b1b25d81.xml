To be an event handler, the `Sub` procedure must have the same signature as each event it is to handle. A generic procedure can be created more than once, with signatures that [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot predict at compile time. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot guarantee a signature that matches those of the events in the `Handles` clause.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32080  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to be generic, remove the `Handles` clause from its declaration. Use the [AddHandler Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/addhandler-statement.md) to associate this event handler with an event.  \n  \n-   If the `Sub` procedure needs to use the `Handles` clause to associate events, remove the [Of](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/of-clause.md) clause from its declaration. You must use a nongeneric procedure with `Handles`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)   \n [NOT IN BUILD:Events and Event Handlers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/95074a0d-1cbc-4221-a95a-964185c7f962)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,80],"content":"Generic methods cannot use &#39;Handles&#39;
