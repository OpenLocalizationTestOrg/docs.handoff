For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> but not in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. This different behavior occurs because <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> measures in the direction of stacking at <xref:System.Double>.<xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity>; however, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> measures only the available size.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates this key difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[StackPanelOvw4#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/CPP/StackPanel_Ovw_Sample4.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[StackPanelOvw4#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/CSharp/StackPanel_Ovw_Sample4.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[StackPanelOvw4#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/VisualBasic/StackPanelSamp.vb#1)]\n [!code-xaml[StackPanelOvw4#1](~/samples/snippets/xaml/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StackPanelOvw4/XAML/default.xaml#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>\n- [Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [WPF], DockPanel\"\n  - \"DockPanel control [WPF], StackPanel control compared to\"\n  - \"StackPanel control [WPF], DockPanel control compared to\"\n  - \"controls [WPF], StackPanel\"\nms.assetid: f9239086-451f-42e6-81f7-ef89ef349742","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[393,440],"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","linkify":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Choose Between StackPanel and DockPanel","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[441,643],"content":"This example shows how to choose between using a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> or a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> when you stack content in a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel&gt;</ph>.","source":"This example shows how to choose between using a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> or a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> when you stack content in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>."},{"pos":[652,659],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Although you can use either <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> to stack child elements, the two controls do not always produce the same results.","pos":[663,858],"source":"Although you can use either <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> or <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> to stack child elements, the two controls do not always produce the same results."},{"content":"For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> but not in a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[859,1051],"source":" For example, the order that you place child elements can affect the size of child elements in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> but not in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>."},{"content":"This different behavior occurs because <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph> measures in the direction of stacking at <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Double&gt;</ph>.<ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity&gt;</ph>; however, <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> measures only the available size.","pos":[1052,1317],"source":" This different behavior occurs because <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> measures in the direction of stacking at <xref:System.Double>.<xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity>; however, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> measures only the available size."},{"pos":[1324,1474],"content":"The following example demonstrates this key difference between <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel&gt;</ph>.","source":"The following example demonstrates this key difference between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel> and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>."},{"pos":[1967,1975],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2066,2103],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Panels Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](panels-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)"}]}
