Since the compiler will be unable to choose, this error will be generated. To resolve, write a new explicit method converting A to B.  \n  \n Another scenario that causes this error is if there are two methods that convert A to B. To fix, specify which conversion to use through an explicit cast.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0457.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0457.cs  \nusing System;  \npublic class A { }  \n  \npublic class G0 {  }  \npublic class G1<R> : G0 {  }  \n  \npublic class H0 {  \n   public static implicit operator G0(H0 h) {  \n      return new G0();  \n   }  \n}  \npublic class H1<R> : H0 {  \n   public static implicit operator G1<R>(H1<R> h) {  \n      return new G1<R>();  \n   }  \n}  \n  \npublic class Test   \n{  \n   public static void F0(G0 g) {  }  \n   public static void Main()   \n   {  \n      H1<A> h1a = new H1<A>();  \n      F0(h1a);   // CS0457  \n   }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0457\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0457\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0457\"\nms.assetid: 5d5cf762-c817-4468-9455-59e966b8c140","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0457","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ambiguous user defined conversions 'Conversion method name 1' and 'Conversion method name 2' when converting from 'type name 1' to 'type name 2'","pos":[194,338]},{"content":"Two conversion methods are applicable, and the compiler is unable to decide which one to use.","pos":[345,438]},{"content":"One scenario that can cause this error is as follows:","pos":[445,498]},{"content":"You want to convert class A to class B where A and B are unrelated.","pos":[508,575]},{"content":"A is derived from A0, and there is a method that converts from A0 to B.","pos":[585,656]},{"content":"B has a subclass B1 and there is a method that converts from A to B1.","pos":[666,735]},{"content":"The compiler will weight the two conversion methods equally, because the first conversion provides the best destination type, and the second conversion provides the best source type.","pos":[742,924]},{"content":"Since the compiler will be unable to choose, this error will be generated.","pos":[925,999]},{"content":"To resolve, write a new explicit method converting A to B.","pos":[1000,1058]},{"content":"Another scenario that causes this error is if there are two methods that convert A to B.
