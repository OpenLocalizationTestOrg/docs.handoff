The following topic walks through the steps to validate such a request.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] authorization, see [Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authorization-in-wcf.md).  \n  \n### To allow metadata requests during authorization  \n  \n1.  Create an extension of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager> class.  \n  \n2.  Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceAuthorizationManager.CheckAccessCore%2A> method. The method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether authorization is allowed. Information about the current procedure is found in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContext> passed as a parameter to the method.  \n  \n3.  In the override, check the contract name, namespace, and the action as shown in the following example. If the conditions are valid, then return `true.`  \n  \n4.  Use the extensibility point to employ the class.
