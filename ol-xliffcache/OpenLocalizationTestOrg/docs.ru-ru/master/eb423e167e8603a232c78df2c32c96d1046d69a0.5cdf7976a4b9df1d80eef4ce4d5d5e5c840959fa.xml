The control points are (100, 10) and (150, 150).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the resulting Bézier spline along with its start point, control points, and endpoint. The illustration also shows the spline's convex hull, which is a polygon formed by connecting the four points with straight lines.  \n  \n ![Bezier Spline](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/bezierspline1.png \"BezierSpline1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#31](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves#31](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConstructingDrawingCurves/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawBezier%2A>   \n [Bézier Splines in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/bezier-splines-in-gdi.md)   \n [How to: Draw a Sequence of Bézier Splines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-a-sequence-of-bezier-splines.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,482],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Single B&#233;zier Spline | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"How to: Draw a Single B&#233;zier Spline | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Single B&amp;#233;zier Spline | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,57],"source":"How to: Draw a Single B&#233;zier Spline | Microsoft Docs"}]}],"pos":[6,66],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Single B&#233;zier Spline | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
