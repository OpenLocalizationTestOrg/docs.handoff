This means the declaration context for a `ReadOnly` element must be a class, structure, or module, and cannot be a source file, namespace, or procedure.  \n  \n-   **Combined Modifiers.** You cannot specify `ReadOnly` together with `Static` in the same declaration.  \n  \n-   **Assigning a Value.** Code consuming a `ReadOnly` property cannot set its value. But code that has access to the underlying storage can assign or change the value at any time.  \n  \n     You can assign a value to a `ReadOnly` variable only in its declaration or in the constructor of a class or structure in which it is defined.  \n  \n## When to Use a ReadOnly Variable  \n There are situations in which you cannot use a [Const Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/const-statement.md) to declare and assign a constant value. For example, the `Const` statement might not accept the data type you want to assign, or you might not be able to compute the value at compile time with a constant expression. You might not even know the value at compile time. In these cases, you can use a `ReadOnly` variable to hold a constant value.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  If the data type of the variable is a reference type, such as an array or a class instance, its members can be changed even if the variable itself is `ReadOnly`. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n `ReadOnly characterArray() As Char = {\"x\"c, \"y\"c, \"z\"c}`  \n  \n `Sub changeArrayElement()`  \n  \n `characterArray(1) = \"M\"c`  \n  \n `End Sub`  \n  \n When initialized, the array pointed to by `characterArray()` holds \"x\", \"y\", and \"z\". Because the variable `characterArray` is `ReadOnly`, you cannot change its value once it is initialized; that is, you cannot assign a new array to it. However, you can change the values of one or more of the array members. Following a call to the procedure `changeArrayElement`, the array pointed to by `characterArray()` holds \"x\", \"M\", and \"z\".  \n  \n Note that this is similar to declaring a procedure parameter to be [ByVal](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/byval.md), which prevents the procedure from changing the calling argument itself but allows it to change its members.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example defines a `ReadOnly` property for the date on which an employee was hired. The class stores the property value internally as a `Private` variable, and only code inside the class can change that value. However, the property is `Public`, and any code that can access the class can read the property.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrKeywords#4](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/codesnippet/VisualBasic/readonly_1.vb)]  \n  \n The `ReadOnly` modifier can be used in these contexts:  \n  \n [Dim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md)  \n  \n [Property Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WriteOnly](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/writeonly.md)   \n [Keywords](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/keywords/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,702],"nodes":[{"content":"ReadOnly (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"ReadOnly (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"ReadOnly (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]}],"pos":[6,49],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"ReadOnly (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
