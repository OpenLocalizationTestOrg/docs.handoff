In the following example, several rectangles are animated by animations with different <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.AccelerationRatio%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.DecelerationRatio%2A> settings.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/AccelDecelExample.xaml#1)]  \n  \n Code has been omitted from this example.
