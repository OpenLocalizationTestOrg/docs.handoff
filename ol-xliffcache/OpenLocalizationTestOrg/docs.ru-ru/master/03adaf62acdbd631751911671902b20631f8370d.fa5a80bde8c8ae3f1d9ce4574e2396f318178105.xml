The Wait models provide a more flexible way of processing multiple asynchronous operations. There are two Wait models, named for the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> methods used to implement them: the Wait (Any) model and the Wait (All) model.  \n  \n To use either Wait model, you need to use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> object returned by the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteNonQuery%2A>, <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteReader%2A>, or <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.BeginExecuteXmlReader%2A> methods. The <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A> and <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A> methods both require you to send the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> objects as an argument, grouped together in an array.  \n  \n Both Wait methods monitor the asynchronous operations, waiting for completion. The <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A> method waits for any of the operations to complete or time out. Once you know a particular operation is complete, you can process its results and then continue waiting for the next operation to complete or time out. The <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A> method waits for all of the processes in the array of <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> instances to complete or time out before continuing.  \n  \n The Wait models' benefit is most striking when you need to run multiple operations of some length on different servers, or when your server is powerful enough to process all the queries at the same time. In the examples presented here, three queries emulate long processes by adding WAITFOR commands of varying lengths to inconsequential SELECT queries.  \n  \n## Example: Wait (Any) Model  \n The following example illustrates the Wait (Any) model. Once three asynchronous processes are started, the <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAny%2A> method is called to wait for the completion of any one of them. As each process completes, the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand.EndExecuteReader%2A> method is called and the resulting <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader> object is read. At this point, a real-world application would likely use the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDataReader> to populate a portion of the page. In this simple example, the time the process completed is added to a text box corresponding to the process. Taken together, the times in the text boxes illustrate the point: Code is executed each time a process completes.  \n  \n To set up this example, create a new ASP.NET Web Site project. Place a <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button> control and four <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.TextBox> controls on the page (accepting the default name for each control).  \n  \n Add the following code to the form's class, modifying the connection string as necessary for your environment.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Add these to the top of the class  \nImports System  \nImports System.Data  \nImports System.Data.SqlClient  \nImports System.Threading  \n  \n' Add this code to the page's class:  \n    Private Function GetConnectionString() As String  \n        ' To avoid storing the connection string in your code,              \n        ' you can retrieve it from a configuration file.   \n  \n        ' If you have not included \"Asynchronous Processing=true\"   \n        ' in the connection string, the command will not be able  \n        ' to execute asynchronously.  \n        Return \"Data Source=(local);Integrated Security=SSPI;\" & _  \n          \"Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;\" & _  \n          \"Asynchronous Processing=true\"  \n    End Function    \n  \n    Sub Button1_Click( _  \n     ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs)  \n  \n        ' In a real-world application, you might be connecting to   \n        '  three different servers or databases.
