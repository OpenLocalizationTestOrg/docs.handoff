Create a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control on your form.  \n  \n2.  Set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.ColumnCount%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.RowCount%2A> properties to **1**.  \n  \n3.  Create a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> occupies the upper-left corner of the cell.  \n  \n4.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `Left`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control moves to align with the left border of the cell.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This behavior differs from the behavior of other container controls. In other container controls, the child control does not move when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property is set, and the distance between the anchored control and the parent container's boundary is fixed at the time the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property is set.  \n  \n5.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `Top, Left`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control moves to occupy the top-left corner of the cell.  \n  \n6.  Repeat step 5 with a value of `Top, Right` to move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control to the top-right corner of the cell. Repeat with values of `Bottom, Left` and `Bottom, Right`.  \n  \n### To stretch a child control in a TableLayoutPanel cell  \n  \n1.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `Left, Right`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is resized to stretch across the cell.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This behavior differs from the behavior of other container controls. In other container controls, the child control is not resized when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property is set to `Left, Right` or `Top, Bottom`.  \n  \n2.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `Top, Bottom`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is resized to stretch from the top to the bottom of the cell.  \n  \n3.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `Top, Bottom, Left, Right`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is resized to fill the cell.  \n  \n4.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to `None`. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is resized and centered in the cell.  \n  \n5.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Left>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control moves to align with the left border of the cell. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control retains its width, but its height is resized to fill the cell vertically.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This is the same behavior that occurs in other container controls.  \n  \n6.  Change the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control is resized to fill the cell.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following illustration shows five buttons anchored in five separate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> cells.  \n  \n ![TableLayoutPanel Anchoring](./media/vs-tlpanchor.gif \"VS_TLPanchor\")  \n  \n The following illustration shows four buttons anchored in the corners of four separate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> cells.  \n  \n ![TableLayoutPanel Anchoring](./media/vs-tlpanchor2.gif \"VS_TLPanchor2\")  \n  \n The following illustration shows three buttons stretched by anchoring in three separate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> cells.  \n  \n ![TableLayoutPanel Anchoring](./media/vs-tlpanchor3.gif \"VS_TLPAnchor3\")  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates all the combinations of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property values for a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.AnchorExampleForm#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.AnchorExampleForm/CS/TlpAnchorExampleForm.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.AnchorExampleForm#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.AnchorExampleForm/VB/TlpAnchorExampleForm.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
