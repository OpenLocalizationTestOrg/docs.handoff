Constant values are directly converted to constant command tree expressions, without any translation on the client. This includes expressions that result in a constant value. Therefore, data source behavior should be expected for all expressions involving constants. This can result in behavior that differs from CLR behavior.  \n  \n The following example shows a constant expression that is evaluated on the server.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#constantexpression)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#constantexpression)]  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)] does not support using a user class as a constant. However, a property reference on a user class is considered a constant, and will be converted to a command tree constant expression and executed on the data source.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,395],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Constant Expressions | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\n  - \"CSharp\"\n  - \"C++\"\nms.assetid: 9d98a7be-b110-4edb-8eba-bed10f250b6d\ncaps.latest.revision: 2\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"Constant Expressions | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[402,422],"content":"Constant Expressions","linkify":"Constant Expressions","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"A constant expression consists of a constant value.","pos":[423,474]},{"content":"Constant values are directly converted to constant command tree expressions, without any translation on the client.","pos":[475,590]},{"content":"This includes expressions that result in a constant value.","pos":[591,649]},{"content":"Therefore, data source behavior should be expected for all expressions involving constants.","pos":[650,741]},{"content":"This can result in behavior that differs from CLR behavior.","pos":[742,801]},{"content":"The following example shows a constant expression that is evaluated on the server.","pos":[808,890]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)]</ph> does not support using a user class as a constant.","pos":[1269,1393],"source":"[!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)] does not support using a user class as a constant."},{"content":"However, a property reference on a user class is considered a constant, and will be converted to a command tree constant expression and executed on the data source.","pos":[1394,1558]},{"pos":[1567,1575],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1579,1731],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)</ept>","source":"[Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)"}]}
