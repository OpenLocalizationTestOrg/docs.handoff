A message could not be forwarded to a specific neighbor because the quota set for that neighbor has been exceeded. This occurs when an unresponsive neighbor fails to clear a backlog of messages pending for that neighbor.  \n  \n## Troubleshooting  \n Reduce the rate at which messages are sent within the mesh.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,96],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,84]}]},{"pos":[394,461],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.PeerFlooderReceiveMessageQuotaExceeded","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"The inbound receive rate of messages is too high.","pos":[462,511]},{"pos":[520,531],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This trace occurs when attempting to process inbound messages.","pos":[535,597]},{"content":"A message could not be forwarded to a specific neighbor because the quota set for that neighbor has been exceeded.","pos":[598,712]},{"content":"This occurs when an unresponsive neighbor fails to clear a backlog of messages pending for that neighbor.","pos":[713,818]},{"pos":[827,842],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Reduce the rate at which messages are sent within the mesh.","pos":[846,905]},{"pos":[914,922],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[926,1000],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1003,1158],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1161,1250],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
