files.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Read from Text Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-text-files.md)  \n Demonstrates how to read from a text file.  \n  \n [How to: Read From Comma-Delimited Text Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-comma-delimited-text-files.md)  \n Demonstrates how to read from a delimited text file.  \n  \n [How to: Read From Fixed-width Text Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-fixed-width-text-files.md)  \n Demonstrates how to read from a fixed-width text file.  \n  \n [How to: Read From Text Files with Multiple Formats](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-text-files-with-multiple-formats.md)  \n Demonstrates how to read from a text file with multiple formats.  \n  \n [How to: Read From Binary Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-binary-files.md)  \n Demonstrates how to read from a binary file.  \n  \n [How to: Read Text from Files with a StreamReader](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-text-from-files-with-a-streamreader.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> to read from a file.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem>  \n Describes the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object and its members.  \n  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.ReadAllText%2A>  \n Describes the `ReadAllText` method.  \n  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.ReadAllBytes%2A>  \n Describes the `ReadAllBytes` method.  \n  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.OpenTextFieldParser%2A>  \n Describes the `OpenTextFieldParser` method.  \n  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.OpenTextFileReader%2A>  \n Describes the `OpenTextFileReader` method.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Storing Data to and Reading from the Clipboard](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/storing-data-to-and-reading-from-the-clipboard.md)  \n Explains how to perform tasks that are associated with `My.Computer.Clipboard`, such as reading data from or writing data to the Clipboard.  \n  \n [Parsing Text Files with the TextFieldParser Object](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/parsing-text-files-with-the-textfieldparser-object.md)  \n Provides an overview of reading text files with the `TextFieldParser` object.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the `My` feature with files and directories.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files by Using .NET Framework Methods](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] methods with files and directories.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,63],"content":"Reading from Files in Visual Basic |
