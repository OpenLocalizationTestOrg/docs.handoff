In this case, `CleanInput` strips out all nonalphanumeric characters except periods (.), at symbols (@), and hyphens (-), and returns the remaining string. However, you can modify the regular expression pattern so that it strips out any characters that should not be included in an input string.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RegularExpressions.Examples.StripChars#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.StripChars/cs/Example.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[RegularExpressions.Examples.StripChars#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/RegularExpressions.Examples.StripChars/vb/Example.vb#1)]  \n  \n The regular expression pattern `[^\\w\\.@-]` matches any character that is not a word character, a period, an @ symbol, or a hyphen. A word character is any letter, decimal digit, or punctuation connector such as an underscore. Any character that matches this pattern is replaced by <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which is the string defined by the replacement pattern. To allow additional characters in user input, add those characters to the character class in the regular expression pattern. For example, the regular expression pattern `[^\\w\\.@-\\\\%]` also allows a percentage symbol and a backslash in an input string.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [.NET Regular Expressions](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,556],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"regular expressions, examples\"\n  - \"cleaning input\"\n  - \"user input, examples\"\n  - \".NET Framework regular expressions, examples\"\n  - \"regular expressions [.NET Framework], examples\"\n  - \"Regex.Replace method\"\n  - \"stripping invalid characters\"\n  - \"Replace method\"\n  - \"validating user input\"\nms.assetid: b4319c8a-9032-4129-a9d5-6f6fc28e7f32\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[563,609],"content":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","linkify":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Strip Invalid Characters from a String","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[610,781],"content":"The following example uses the static <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> method to strip invalid characters from a string.","source":"The following example uses the static <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Replace%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to strip invalid characters from a string."},{"pos":[790,797],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"You can use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`CleanInput`</ph> method defined in this example to strip potentially harmful characters that have been entered into a text field that accepts user input.","pos":[801,966],"source":"You can use the `CleanInput` method defined in this example to strip potentially harmful characters that have been entered into a text field that accepts user input."},{"content":"In this case, <ph id=\"ph1\">`CleanInput`</ph> strips out all nonalphanumeric characters except periods (.), at symbols (@), and hyphens (-), and returns the remaining string.","pos":[967,1122],"source":" In this case, `CleanInput` strips out all nonalphanumeric characters except periods (.), at symbols (@), and hyphens (-), and returns the remaining string."},{"content":"However, you can modify the regular expression pattern so that it strips out any characters that should not be included in an input string.","pos":[1123,1262]},{"content":"The regular expression pattern <ph id=\"ph1\">`[^\\w\\.@-]`</ph> matches any character that is not a word character, a period, an @ symbol, or a hyphen.","pos":[1601,1731],"source":"The regular expression pattern `[^\\w\\.@-]` matches any character that is not a word character, a period, an @ symbol, or a hyphen."},{"content":"A word character is any letter, decimal digit, or punctuation connector such as an underscore.","pos":[1732,1826]},{"content":"Any character that matches this pattern is replaced by <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>, which is the string defined by the replacement pattern.","pos":[1827,1994],"source":" Any character that matches this pattern is replaced by <xref:System.String.Empty?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which is the string defined by the replacement pattern."},{"content":"To allow additional characters in user input, add those characters to the character class in the regular expression pattern.","pos":[1995,2119]},{"content":"For example, the regular expression pattern <ph id=\"ph1\">`[^\\w\\.@-\\\\%]`</ph> also allows a percentage symbol and a backslash in an input string.","pos":[2120,2246],"source":" For example, the regular expression pattern `[^\\w\\.@-\\\\%]` also allows a percentage symbol and a backslash in an input string."},{"pos":[2255,2263],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2267,2351],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>.NET Regular Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md)</ept>","source":"[.NET Regular Expressions](../../../docs/standard/base-types/regular-expressions.md)"}]}
