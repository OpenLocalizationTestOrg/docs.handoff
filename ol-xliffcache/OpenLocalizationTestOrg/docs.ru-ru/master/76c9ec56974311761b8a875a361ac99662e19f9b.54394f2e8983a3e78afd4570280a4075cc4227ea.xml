The Entity Data Model Tools in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] allow you to create an .[edmx file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f4c8e7ce-1db6-417e-9759-15f8b55155d4) from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes.  \n  \n Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can also create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.  \n  \n For more information, see [Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016).  \n  \n You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. The EdmGen.exe generates the .csdl, .ssdl, and .msl files from an existing data source. You can also manually create the model and mapping content. For more information, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md).","nodes":[{"pos":[12,49],"content":"Modeling and Mapping | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Modeling and Mapping | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]},{"pos":[426,446],"content":"Modeling and Mapping","linkify":"Modeling and Mapping","nodes":[{"content":"Modeling and Mapping","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"In the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]</ph>, you can define the conceptual model, storage model, and the mapping between the two in the way that best suits your application.","pos":[447,646],"source":"In the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)], you can define the conceptual model, storage model, and the mapping between the two in the way that best suits your application."},{"content":"The Entity Data Model Tools in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]</ph> allow you to create an .<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>edmx file<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f4c8e7ce-1db6-417e-9759-15f8b55155d4)</ept> from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes.","pos":[647,946],"source":" The Entity Data Model Tools in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] allow you to create an .[edmx file](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f4c8e7ce-1db6-417e-9759-15f8b55155d4) from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes."},{"content":"Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can also create a model programmatically using Code First development.","pos":[953,1066]},{"content":"There are two different scenarios for Code First development.","pos":[1067,1128]},{"content":"In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.","pos":[1129,1328]},{"pos":[1335,1450],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016)."},{"content":"You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[1457,1587],"source":"You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]."},{"content":"The EdmGen.exe generates the .csdl, .ssdl, and .msl files from an existing data source.","pos":[1588,1675]},{"content":"You can also manually create the model and mapping content.","pos":[1676,1735]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1736,1865],"source":" For more information, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md)."}]}
