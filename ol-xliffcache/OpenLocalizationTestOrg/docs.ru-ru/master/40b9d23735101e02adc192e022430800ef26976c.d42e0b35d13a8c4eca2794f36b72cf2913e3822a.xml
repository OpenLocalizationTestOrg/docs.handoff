[ICLRDebugManager](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-interface.md) provides three methods, `BeginConnection`, [SetConnectionTasks](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-setconnectiontasks-method.md), and [EndConnection](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrdebugmanager-endconnection-method.md), for associating task lists with identifiers and friendly names.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  These three methods must be called in a specific order for each set of tasks. `BeginConnection` is called first to establish a new connection. `SetConnectionTasks` is called next to provide the set of tasks to be associated with that connection. `EndConnection` is called last to remove the association between the task list and the identifier and friendly name.However, calls for different connections can be nested.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n
