One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim divisor = 3  \n' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(divisor <> 0, number \\ divisor, \"Division by zero\"))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33106  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.  \n  \n-   Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)\n- [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)\n- [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,242],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc33106\"\n  - \"bc33106\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33106\"\nms.assetid: 793eed88-a9f9-43e3-b657-c16795ecbbcc","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","pos":[0,81]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[249,330],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","linkify":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator","pos":[0,81]}]},{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator.","pos":[331,413]},{"content":"One must have a widening conversion to the other.","pos":[414,463]},{"content":"When the <ph id=\"ph1\">`If`</ph> operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments.","pos":[470,600],"source":"When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments."},{"content":"For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between <ph id=\"ph1\">`Integer`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`String`</ph>, the following code causes this error.","pos":[601,746],"source":" For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error."},{"pos":[881,902],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33106","source":"**Error ID:** BC33106"},{"pos":[911,932],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.","pos":[942,1031]},{"pos":[1041,1121],"content":"Use a different condition construction, such as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`If...Then...Else`</ph> statement.","source":"Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement."},{"pos":[1130,1138],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1142,1219],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1222,1326],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1329,1470],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Widening and Narrowing Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)</ept>","source":"[Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)"}]}
