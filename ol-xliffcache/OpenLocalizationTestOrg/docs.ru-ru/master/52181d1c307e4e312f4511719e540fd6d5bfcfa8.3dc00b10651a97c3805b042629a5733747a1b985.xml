Custom events allow the event to call its event handlers asynchronously.  \n  \n By default, the backing-store field for an event declaration is a multicast delegate that serially combines all the event handlers. This means that if one handler takes a long time to complete, it blocks the other handlers until it completes. (Well-behaved event handlers should never perform lengthy or potentially blocking operations.)  \n  \n Instead of using the default implementation of events that Visual Basic provides, you can use a custom event to execute the event handlers asynchronously.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, the `AddHandler` accessor adds the delegate for each handler of the `Click` event to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> stored in the `EventHandlerList` field.  \n  \n When code raises the `Click` event, the `RaiseEvent` accessor invokes all the event handler delegates asynchronously using the <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A> method. That method invokes each handler on a worker thread and returns immediately, so handlers cannot block one another.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrEvents#27](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-avoid-blocking_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>   \n <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A>   \n [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)   \n [How to: Declare Custom Events To Conserve Memory](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-conserve-memory.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,666],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
