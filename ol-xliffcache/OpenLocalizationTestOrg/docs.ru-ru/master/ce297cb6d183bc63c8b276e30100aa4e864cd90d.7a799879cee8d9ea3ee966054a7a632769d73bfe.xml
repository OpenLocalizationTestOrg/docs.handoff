The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> class provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A> static methods so that you can determine which image encoders are available. <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A> returns an array of <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> objects.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example outputs the list of installed encoders and their property values.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A Windows Forms application.  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: List Installed Decoders](how-to-list-installed-decoders.md)\n- [Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,261],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: List Installed Encoders\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"image codecs [Windows Forms], listing\"\n  - \"image encoders [Windows Forms], listing\"\nms.assetid: 49e8e4e9-7a67-42d9-86bf-08821cdc282e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Encoders","nodes":[{"pos":[0,31],"content":"How to: List Installed Encoders","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Encoders","pos":[0,31]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[268,299],"content":"How to: List Installed Encoders","linkify":"How to: List Installed Encoders","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Encoders","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"You may want to list the image encoders available on a computer, to determine whether your application can save to a particular image file format.","pos":[300,446]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo&gt;</ph> class provides the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A&gt;</ph> static methods so that you can determine which image encoders are available.","pos":[447,656],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> class provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A> static methods so that you can determine which image encoders are available."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A&gt;</ph> returns an array of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo&gt;</ph> objects.","pos":[657,795],"source":"<xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageEncoders%2A> returns an array of <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> objects."},{"pos":[804,811],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example outputs the list of installed encoders and their property values.","pos":[815,907]},{"pos":[1192,1210],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1214,1236]},{"content":"A Windows Forms application.","pos":[1246,1274]},{"pos":[1284,1400],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1409,1417],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1421,1489],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: List Installed Decoders<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-list-installed-decoders.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: List Installed Decoders](how-to-list-installed-decoders.md)"},{"pos":[1492,1596],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)"}]}
