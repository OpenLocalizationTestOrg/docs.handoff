[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] enables you to define such operations as methods on the data service. Like other data service resources, these service operations are addressed by using URIs. A service operation can return collections of entity types, single entity type instances, and primitive types, such as integer and string. A service operation can also return `null` (`Nothing` in Visual Basic). The [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library can be used to access service operations that support HTTP GET requests. These kinds of service operations are defined as methods that have the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> applied. For more information, see [Service Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/service-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n Service operations are exposed in the metadata returned by a data service that implements the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)]. In the metadata, service operations are represented as `FunctionImport` elements. When generating the strongly-typed <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>, the Add Service Reference and DataSvcUtil.exe tools ignore this element. Because of this, you will not find a method on the context that can be used to call a service operation directly. However, you can still use the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client to call service operations in one of these two ways:  \n  \n-   By calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.Execute%2A> method on the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>, supplying the URI of the service operation, along with any parameters. This method is used to call any GET service operation.  \n  \n-   By using the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.CreateQuery%2A> method on the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> to create a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> object. When calling <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.CreateQuery%2A>, the name of the service operation is supplied to the `entitySetName` parameter. This method returns a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> object that calls the service operation when enumerated or when the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.Execute%2A> method is called. This method is used to call GET service operations that return a collection. A single parameter can be supplied by using the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.AddQueryOption%2A> method. The <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> object returned by this method can be further composed against like any query object. For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Considerations for Calling Service Operations  \n The following considerations apply when using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client to call service operations.  \n  \n-   When accessing the data service asynchronously, you must use the equivalent asynchronous <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.BeginExecute%2A>/<xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.EndExecute%2A> methods on <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> or the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A>/<xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> methods on <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601>.  \n  \n-   The [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library cannot materialize the results from a service operation that returns a collection of primitive types.  \n  \n-   The [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library does not support calling POST service operations. Service operations that are called by an HTTP POST are defined by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> with the `Method=\"POST\"` parameter. To call a service operation by using an HTTP POST request, you must instead use an <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest>.  \n  \n-   You cannot use <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.CreateQuery%2A> to call a GET service operation that returns a single result, of either entity or primitive type, or that requires more than one input parameter. You must instead call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.Execute%2A> method.  \n  \n-   Consider creating an extension method on the strongly-typed <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> partial class, which is generated by the tools, that uses either the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.CreateQuery%2A> or the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.Execute%2A> method to call a service operation. This enables you to call service operations directly from the context. For more information, see the blog post [Service Operations and the WCF Data Services Client](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=215668).  \n  \n-   When you use <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.CreateQuery%2A> to call a service operation, the client library automatically escapes characters supplied to the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.AddQueryOption%2A> by performing percent-encoding of reserved characters, such as ampersand (&), and escaping of single-quotes in strings. However, when you call one of the *Execute* methods to call a service operation, you must remember to perform this escaping of any user-supplied string values. Single-quotes in URIs are escaped as pairs of single-quotes.  \n  \n## Examples of Calling Service Operations  \n This section contains the following examples of how to call service operations by using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library:  \n  \n-   [Calling Execute&lt;T&gt;
