It then asynchronously writes each letter or white-space character to a separate line of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[StreamReaderWriter](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StringReaderWriter/MainWindow.xaml.cs)]\n [!code-vb[StreamReaderWriter](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StringReaderWriter/MainWindow.xaml.vb)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO.StringWriter>  \n- <xref:System.IO.StringWriter.Write%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  \n- <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder>  \n- [File and stream I/O](../../../docs/standard/io/index.md)  \n- [Asynchronous file I/O](../../../docs/standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o.md)  \n- [How to: Enumerate directories and files](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-enumerate-directories-and-files.md)  \n- [How to: Read and write to a newly created data file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-read-and-write-to-a-newly-created-data-file.md)  \n- [How to: Open and append to a log file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-open-and-append-to-a-log-file.md)  \n- [How to: Read text from a file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-read-text-from-a-file.md)  \n- [How to: Write text to a file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-write-text-to-a-file.md)  \n- [How to: Read characters from a string](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-read-characters-from-a-string.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,432],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Write characters to a string\"\nms.date: \"01/21/2019\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  -
