By working with the information available in the event arguments of these events, you can easily facilitate drag-and-drop operations.  \n  \n## Dragging Data  \n All drag-and-drop operations begin with dragging. The functionality to enable data to be collected when dragging begins is implemented in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A> method.  \n  \n In the following example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event is used to start the drag operation because it is the most intuitive (most drag-and-drop actions begin with the mouse button being depressed). However, remember that any event could be used to initiate a drag-and-drop procedure.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Certain controls have custom drag-specific events. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> controls, for example, have an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.ItemDrag> event.  \n  \n#### To start a drag operation  \n  \n1.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event for the control where the drag will begin, use the `DoDragDrop` method to set the data to be dragged and the allowed effect dragging will have. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs.Data%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs.AllowedEffect%2A>.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to initiate a drag operation. The control where the drag begins is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control, the data being dragged is the string representing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control, and the allowed effects are either copying or moving.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Button1_MouseDown(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs) Handles Button1.MouseDown  \n       Button1.DoDragDrop(Button1.Text, DragDropEffects.Copy Or DragDropEffects.Move)  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_MouseDown(object sender,   \n    System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       button1.DoDragDrop(button1.Text, DragDropEffects.Copy |   \n          DragDropEffects.Move);  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Any data can be used as a parameter in the `DoDragDrop` method; in the example above, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control was used (rather than hard-coding a value or retrieving data from a dataset) because the property was related to the location being dragged from (the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control). Keep this in mind as you incorporate drag-and-drop operations into your Windows-based applications.  \n  \n While a drag operation is in effect, you can handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.QueryContinueDrag> event, which \"asks permission\" of the system to continue the drag operation. When handling this method, it is also the appropriate point for you to call methods that will have an effect on the drag operation, such as expanding a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control when the cursor hovers over it.  \n  \n## Dropping Data  \n Once you have begun dragging data from a location on a Windows Form or control, you will naturally want to drop it somewhere. The cursor will change when it crosses an area of a form or control that is correctly configured for dropping data. Any area within a Windows Form or control can be made to accept dropped data by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AllowDrop%2A> property and handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> events.  \n  \n#### To perform a drop  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AllowDrop%2A> property to true.  \n  \n2.  In the `DragEnter` event for the control where the drop will occur, ensure that the data being dragged is of an acceptable type (in this case, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A>). The code then sets the effect that will happen when the drop occurs to a value in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragDropEffects> enumeration. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs.Effect%2A>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub TextBox1_DragEnter(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles TextBox1.DragEnter  \n       If (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.Text)) Then  \n         e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy  \n       Else  \n         e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None  \n       End If  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void textBox1_DragEnter(object sender,   \n    System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       if (e.Data.GetDataPresent(DataFormats.Text))   \n          e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Copy;  \n       else  \n          e.Effect = DragDropEffects.None;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can define your own <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataFormats> by specifying your own object as the <xref:System.Object> parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataObject.SetData%2A> method. Be sure, when doing this, that the object specified is serializable. For more information, see <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable>.  \n  \n3.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> event for the control where the drop will occur, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataObject.GetData%2A> method to retrieve the data being dragged. For more information, see <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.DataObject.Data%2A>.  \n  \n     In the example below, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control is the control being dragged to (where the drop will occur). The code sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control equal to the data being dragged.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub TextBox1_DragDrop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles TextBox1.DragDrop  \n       TextBox1.Text = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.Text).ToString  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void textBox1_DragDrop(object sender,   \n    System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       textBox1.Text = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.Text).ToString();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Additionally, you can work with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs.KeyState%2A> property, so that, depending on keys depressed during the drag-and-drop operation, certain effects occur (for example, it is standard to copy the dragged data when the CTRL key is pressed).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Add Data to the Clipboard](how-to-add-data-to-the-clipboard.md)\n- [How to: Retrieve Data from the Clipboard](how-to-retrieve-data-from-the-clipboard.md)\n- [Drag-and-Drop Operations and Clipboard Support](drag-and-drop-operations-and-clipboard-support.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,303],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Forms, drag and drop operations\"\n  - \"drag and drop [Windows Forms], Windows Forms\"\nms.assetid: eb66f6bf-4a7d-4c2d-b276-40fefb2d3b6c","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"pos":[0,66],"content":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","pos":[0,66]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[310,376],"content":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","linkify":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"To perform drag-and-drop operations within Windows-based applications you must handle a series of events, most notably the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragLeave&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop&gt;</ph> events.","pos":[377,650],"source":"To perform drag-and-drop operations within Windows-based applications you must handle a series of events, most notably the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragLeave>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> events."},{"content":"By working with the information available in the event arguments of these events, you can easily facilitate drag-and-drop operations.","pos":[651,784]},{"pos":[793,806],"content":"Dragging Data","linkify":"Dragging Data","nodes":[{"content":"Dragging Data","pos":[0,13]}]},{"content":"All drag-and-drop operations begin with dragging.","pos":[810,859]},{"content":"The functionality to enable data to be collected when dragging begins is implemented in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[860,1009],"source":" The functionality to enable data to be collected when dragging begins is implemented in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A> method."},{"content":"In the following example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown&gt;</ph> event is used to start the drag operation because it is the most intuitive (most drag-and-drop actions begin with the mouse button being depressed).","pos":[1016,1240],"source":"In the following example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event is used to start the drag operation because it is the most intuitive (most drag-and-drop actions begin with the mouse button being depressed)."},{"content":"However, remember that any event could be used to initiate a drag-and-drop procedure.","pos":[1241,1326]},{"pos":[1334,1561],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Certain controls have custom drag-specific events.
