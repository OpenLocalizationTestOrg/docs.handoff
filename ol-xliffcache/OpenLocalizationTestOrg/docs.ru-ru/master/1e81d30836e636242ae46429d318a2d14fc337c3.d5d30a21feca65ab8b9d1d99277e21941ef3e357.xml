Unlike other [properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/property.md), navigation properties do not carry data.  \n  \n A navigation property definition includes the following:  \n  \n-   A name. (Required)  \n  \n-   The association that it navigates. (Required)  \n  \n-   The ends of the association that it navigates. (Required)  \n  \n Note that navigation properties are optional on both entity types at the ends of an association. If you define a navigation property on one entity type at the end of an association, you do not have to define a navigation property on the entity type at the other end of the association.  \n  \n The data type of a navigation property is determined by the [multiplicity](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end-multiplicity.md) of its remote [association end](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end.md). For example, suppose a navigation property, `OrdersNavProp`, exists on a `Customer` entity type and navigates a one-to-many association between `Customer` and `Order`. Because the remote association end for the navigation property has multiplicity of many (*), its data type is a collection (of `Order`). Similarly, if a navigation property, `CustomerNavProp`, exists on the `Order` entity type, its data type would be `Customer`, because the multiplicity of the remote end is one (1).  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with three entity types: `Book`, `Publisher`, and `Author`. Navigation properties, `Publisher` and `Authors`, are defined on the Book entity type. Navigation property `Books` is defined on both the Publisher entity type and the `Author` entity type.  \n  \n ![Model with Navigation Properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/modelwithnavprops.gif \"ModelWithNavProps\")  \n  \n The [ADO.NET Entity Framework](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/index.md) uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The following CSDL defines the `Book` entity type shown in the diagram above:  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#EntityExample](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books.edmx#entityexample)]  \n  \n Note that XML attributes are used to communicate the information necessary to define a navigation property: The attribute `Name` contains the name of the property, `Relationship` contains the name of the association it navigates, and `FromRole` and `ToRole` contain the ends of the association.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)   \n [Entity Data
