In addition to its string-based sorting capabilities, <xref:System.Data.DataView> also enables you to use [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] expressions for the sorting criteria. [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../includes/vbteclinq-md.md)] expressions allow for much more complex and powerful sorting operations than string-based sorting. This topic describes both approaches to sorting using <xref:System.Data.DataView>.  \n  \n## Creating DataView from a Query with Sorting Information  \n A <xref:System.Data.DataView> object can be created from a [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)] query. If that query contains an <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderBy%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderByDescending%2A>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ThenBy%2A>, or <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.ThenByDescending%2A> clause the expressions in these clauses are used as the basis for sorting the data in the <xref:System.Data.DataView>. For example, if the query contains the `Order By…`and `Then By…` clauses, the resulting <xref:System.Data.DataView> would order the data by both columns specified.  \n  \n Expression-based sorting offers more powerful and complex sorting than the simpler string-based sorting. Note that string-based and expression-based sorting are mutually exclusive. If the string-based <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> is set after a <xref:System.Data.DataView> is created from a query, the expression-based filter inferred from the query is cleared and cannot be reset.  \n  \n The index for a <xref:System.Data.DataView> is built both when the <xref:System.Data.DataView> is created and when any of the sorting or filtering information is modified. You get the best performance by supplying sorting criteria in the [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)] query that the <xref:System.Data.DataView> is created from and not modifying the sorting information, later. For more information, see [DataView Performance](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataview-performance.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In most cases, the expressions used for sorting should not have side effects and must be deterministic. Also, the expressions should not contain any logic that depends on a set number of executions, because the sorting operations might be executed any number of times.  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example queries the SalesOrderHeader table and orders the returned rows by the order date; creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from that query; and binds the <xref:System.Data.DataView> to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderBy](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#createldvfromqueryorderby)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderBy](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#createldvfromqueryorderby)]  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example queries the SalesOrderHeader table and orders the returned row by total amount due; creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from that query; and binds the <xref:System.Data.DataView> to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderBy2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#createldvfromqueryorderby2)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderBy2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#createldvfromqueryorderby2)]  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example queries the SalesOrderDetail table and orders the returned rows by order quantity and then by sales order ID; creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from that query; and binds the <xref:System.Data.DataView> to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderByThenBy](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#createldvfromqueryorderbythenby)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryOrderByThenBy](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#createldvfromqueryorderbythenby)]  \n  \n## Using the String-Based Sort Property  \n The string-based sorting functionality of <xref:System.Data.DataView> still works with [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)]. After a <xref:System.Data.DataView> has been created from a [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)] query, you can use the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to set the sorting on the <xref:System.Data.DataView>.  \n  \n The string-based and expression-based sorting functionality are mutually exclusive. Setting the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property will clear the expression-based sort inherited from the query that the <xref:System.Data.DataView> was created from.  \n  \n For more information about string-based <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> filtering, see [Sorting and Filtering Data](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/sorting-and-filtering-data.md).  \n  \n### Example  \n The follow example creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from the Contact table and sorts the rows by last name in descending order, then first name in ascending order:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#LDVStringSort](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#ldvstringsort)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#LDVStringSort](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#ldvstringsort)]  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example queries the Contact table for last names that start with the letter \"S\".  A <xref:System.Data.DataView> is created from that query and bound to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryStringSort](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#createldvfromquerystringsort)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#CreateLDVFromQueryStringSort](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#createldvfromquerystringsort)]  \n  \n## Clearing the Sort  \n The sorting information on a <xref:System.Data.DataView> can be cleared after it has been set using the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property. There are two ways to clear the sorting information in <xref:System.Data.DataView>:  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to `null`.  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to an empty string.  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from a query and clears the sorting by setting the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to an empty string:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView Samples#LDVClearSort](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/CS/Form1.cs#ldvclearsort)]\n [!code-vb[DP DataView Samples#LDVClearSort](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP DataView Samples/VB/Form1.vb#ldvclearsort)]  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.Data.DataView> from the Contact table and sets the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to sort by last name in descending order. The sorting information is then cleared by setting the <xref:System.Data.DataView.Sort%2A> property to `null`:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP DataView
