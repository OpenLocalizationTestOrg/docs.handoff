The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> property will convert <xref:System.DBNull> to a specified object when formatting or parsing the data source values.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.DBNull> value in two different situations. The first demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> for a string property; the second demonstrates how to set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> for an image property.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingDBNull/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n The types of the bound property and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> property must be the same or an error will result, and no further <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> values will be processed. In this situation, an exception will not be thrown.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [BindingSource Component](bindingsource-component.md)\n- [How to: Handle Errors and Exceptions that Occur with Databinding](how-to-handle-errors-and-exceptions-that-occur-with-databinding.md)\n- [How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BindingSource component [Windows Forms], binding to DBNull values\"\n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], BindingSource component\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], binding to DBNull values\"\nms.assetid: 96494e6f-5f40-4f83-af97-bbd7192c2af8","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[393,454],"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","linkify":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"When you bind Windows Forms controls to a data source and the data source returns a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.DBNull&gt;</ph> value, you can substitute an appropriate value without handling, formatting, or parsing events.","pos":[455,655],"source":"When you bind Windows Forms controls to a data source and the data source returns a <xref:System.DBNull> value, you can substitute an appropriate value without handling, formatting, or parsing events."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A&gt;</ph> property will convert <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.DBNull&gt;</ph> to a specified object when formatting or parsing the data source values.","pos":[656,824],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A> property will convert <xref:System.DBNull> to a specified object when formatting or parsing the data source values."},{"pos":[833,840],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example demonstrates how to bind a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.DBNull&gt;</ph> value in two different situations.","pos":[844,948],"source":"The following example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.DBNull> value in two different situations."},{"content":"The first demonstrates how to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.NullValue%2A&gt;</ph> for a string property;
