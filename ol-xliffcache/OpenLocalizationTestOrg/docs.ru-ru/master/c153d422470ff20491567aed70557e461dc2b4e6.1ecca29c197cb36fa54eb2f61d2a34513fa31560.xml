Alternatively, you can add rows and columns to the control and manually populate it with data.  \n  \n When you bind the control to a data source, you can generate columns automatically based on the schema of the data source. If these columns do not appear just as you want them to, you can hide, remove, or rearrange them. You can also add unbound columns to display supplemental data that does not come from the data source.  \n  \n Additionally, you can display your data using standard formats (such as currency format), or you can customize the display formatting to present your data however you need to (such as changing the background color for negative numbers, or replacing string values with corresponding images).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Data Display Modes in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](data-display-modes-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes the options for populating
