Generally, this includes selecting an appropriate system-provided binding, setting the properties of the security element, and then setting properties of the service behaviors that govern how credentials are retrieved for use by either the service or the client. These techniques cover the security requirements of most users for most scenarios, as shown in [Common Security Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/common-security-scenarios.md). If your scenario requires more capabilities, first see [Security Capabilities with Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-capabilities-with-custom-bindings.md); if a solution is not apparent, see [Extending Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/extending-security.md). If you are creating (or interoperating with) a system that uses rich claims, see the topics in [Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authorization-in-wcf.md).  \n  \n## In

 \n  \n [Secure Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/secure-sessions.md)  \n A discussion of the considerations required when securing a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] session.  \n  \n [Working with Certificates](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md)  \n An explanation of
