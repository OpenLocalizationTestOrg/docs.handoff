This topic describes how to automatically generate data types for the .NET Blog RSS feed.  \n  \n### Obtaining the XML from the .NET Blog RSS feed  \n  \n1.  In Internet Explorer, navigate to the [.NET Blog RSS feed](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/feed/).  \n  \n2.  Right-click the page and select **View Source**.  \n  \n3.  Copy the text of the feed by pressing **Ctrl+A** to select all text, and **Ctrl+C** to copy.  \n  \n### Creating the data types  \n  \n1.  Open a code file where the proxy is to be used. This file should be part of a [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] project.  \n  \n2.  Place the cursor in a location in the file outside any existing classes.  \n  \n3.  Select **Edit**, **Paste Special**, **Paste XML as Classes**.  \n  \n4.  Classes called `link`, `rss`, `rssChannel`, `rssChannelImage`, `rssChannelItem` and `rssChannelItemGuid` are created with the necessary members for accessing the elements in the RSS feed.  \n  \n### Using the generated classes  \n  \n1.  Once the classes are generated, they can be used in code like any other classes. The following code example returns a new instance of the `rssChannelImage` class.  \n  \n    ```  \n    var channelImage = new rssChannelImage()   \n    {   \n        title = \"MyImage\",   \n        link = \"http://www.contoso.com/images/channelImage.jpg\",   \n        url = \"http://www.contoso.com/entries/myEntry.html\"   \n    };  \n    ```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,121],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Generating Data Type Classes from XML\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: e4e5e4e8-527f-44d1-92fa-8904a08784ea","nodes":[{"content":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","nodes":[{"content":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[128,165],"content":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","linkify":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","nodes":[{"content":"Generating Data Type Classes from XML","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]</ph> includes a new feature to generate data type classes from XML.","pos":[166,281],"source":"[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] includes a new feature to generate data type classes from XML."},{"content":"This topic describes how to automatically generate data types for the .NET Blog RSS feed.","pos":[282,371]},{"pos":[381,426],"content":"Obtaining the XML from the .NET Blog RSS feed","linkify":"Obtaining the XML from the .NET Blog RSS feed","nodes":[{"content":"Obtaining the XML from the .NET Blog RSS feed","pos":[0,45]}]},{"pos":[436,540],"content":"In Internet Explorer, navigate to the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>.NET Blog RSS feed<ept id=\"p1\">](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/feed/)</ept>.","source":"In Internet Explorer, navigate to the [.NET Blog RSS feed](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/feed/)."},{"pos":[550,598],"content":"Right-click the page and select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>View Source<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Right-click the page and select **View Source**."},{"pos":[608,700],"content":"Copy the text of the feed by pressing <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Ctrl+A<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to select all text, and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Ctrl+C<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to copy.","source":"Copy the text of the feed by pressing **Ctrl+A** to select all text, and **Ctrl+C** to copy."},{"pos":[710,733],"content":"Creating the data types","linkify":"Creating the data types","nodes":[{"content":"Creating the data types","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Open a code file where the proxy is to be used.","pos":[743,790]},{"content":"This file should be part of a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]</ph> project.","pos":[791,882],"source":" This file should be part of a [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] project."},{"content":"Place the cursor in a location in the file outside any existing classes.","pos":[892,964]},{"pos":[974,1035],"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Edit<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Paste Special<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Paste XML as Classes<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","source":"Select **Edit**, **Paste Special**, **Paste XML as Classes**."},{"pos":[1045,1232],"content":"Classes called <ph id=\"ph1\">`link`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`rss`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">`rssChannel`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph4\">`rssChannelImage`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph5\">`rssChannelItem`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph6\">`rssChannelItemGuid`</ph> are created with the necessary members for accessing the elements in the RSS feed.","source":"Classes called `link`, `rss`, `rssChannel`, `rssChannelImage`, `rssChannelItem` and `rssChannelItemGuid` are created with the necessary members for accessing the elements in the RSS feed."},{"pos":[1242,1269],"content":"Using the generated classes","linkify":"Using the generated classes","nodes":[{"content":"Using the generated classes","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"Once the classes are generated, they can be used in code like any other classes.","pos":[1279,1359]},{"content":"The following code example returns a new instance of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`rssChannelImage`</ph> class.","pos":[1360,1441],"source":" The following code example returns a new instance of the `rssChannelImage` class."}]}
