This means the following limitations apply:  \n  \n-   An attribute cannot be a generic type or be declared within a generic type.  \n  \n-   An attribute cannot inherit from a generic class, nor can a generic class inherit from an attribute.  \n  \n-   When you apply an attribute, you cannot supply an argument that is any of the following:  \n  \n    -   A generic type,  \n  \n    -   A type constructed from a generic type,  \n  \n    -   A type parameter of a containing type, or  \n  \n    -   A type constructed from a type parameter of a containing type.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32074  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the base class to something other than an attribute class, or remove the `Inherits` statement entirely.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Attribute>\n\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n- [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n- [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,255],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32074\"\n  - \"BC32074\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32074\"\nms.assetid: 3552ac98-d86a-4962-9d51-b9a8acc38ea1","nodes":[{"content":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","nodes":[{"pos":[0,94],"content":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","nodes":[{"content":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","pos":[0,94]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[262,356],"content":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","linkify":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","nodes":[{"content":"Classes that are generic or contained in a generic type cannot inherit from an attribute class","pos":[0,94]}]},{"content":"A class that is either generic or nested within a generic type specifies that it inherits from an attribute class.","pos":[357,471]},{"content":"Visual Basic and the .NET Framework do not currently support any combination of attributes and generic types.","pos":[478,587]},{"content":"This means the following limitations apply:","pos":[588,631]},{"content":"An attribute cannot be a generic type or be declared within a generic type.","pos":[641,716]},{"content":"An attribute cannot inherit from a generic class, nor can a generic class inherit from an attribute.","pos":[726,826]},{"content":"When you apply an attribute, you cannot supply an argument that is any of the following:","pos":[836,924]},{"content":"A generic type,","pos":[938,953]},{"content":"A type constructed from a generic type,","pos":[967,1006]},{"content":"A type parameter of a containing type, or","pos":[1020,1061]},{"content":"A type constructed from a type parameter of a containing type.","pos":[1075,1137]},{"pos":[1144,1165],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32074","source":"**Error ID:** BC32074"},{"pos":[1174,1195],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1205,1315],"content":"Change the base class to something other than an attribute class, or remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Inherits`</ph> statement entirely.","source":"Change the base class to something other than an attribute class, or remove the `Inherits` statement entirely."},{"pos":[1324,1332],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1363,1478],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Generic Types in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)"},{"pos":[1481,1599],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inheritance Basics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)</ept>","source":"[Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)"},{"pos":[1602,1694],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inherits Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)"}]}
