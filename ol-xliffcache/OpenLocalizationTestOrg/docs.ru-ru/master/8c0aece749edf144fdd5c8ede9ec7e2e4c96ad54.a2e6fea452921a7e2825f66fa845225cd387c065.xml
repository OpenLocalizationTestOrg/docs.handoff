Any expression, consisting exclusively of one or more conditional compiler constants, literals, and operators, that evaluates to `True` or `False`.  \n  \n `statements`  \n Required for `#If` statement block, optional elsewhere. Visual Basic program lines or compiler directives that are compiled if the associated expression evaluates to `True`.  \n  \n `#End If`  \n Terminates the `#If` statement block.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n On the surface, the behavior of the `#If...Then...#Else` directives appears the same as that of the `If...Then...Else` statements. However, the `#If...Then...#Else` directives evaluate what is compiled by the compiler, whereas the `If...Then...Else` statements evaluate conditions at run time.  \n  \n Conditional compilation is typically used to compile the same program for different platforms. It is also used to prevent debugging code from appearing in an executable file. Code excluded during conditional compilation is completely omitted from the final executable file, so it has no effect on size or performance.  \n  \n Regardless of the outcome of any evaluation, all expressions are evaluated using `Option Compare Binary`. The `Option Compare` statement does not affect expressions in `#If` and `#ElseIf` statements.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  No single-line form of the `#If`, `#Else`, `#ElseIf`, and `#End If` directives exists. No other code can appear on the same line as any of the directives. \n\nThe statements within a conditional compilation block must be complete logical statements. For example, you cannot conditionally compile only the attributes of a function, but you can conditionally declare the function along with its attributes:\n\n```vb\n   #If DEBUG Then\n   <WebMethod()>\n   Public Function SomeFunction() As String\n   #Else\n   <WebMethod(CacheDuration:=86400)>\n   Public Function SomeFunction() As String\n   #End If\n```\n\n## Example\n This example uses the `#If...Then...#Else` construct to determine whether to compile certain statements.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrConditionalComp#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrConditionalComp/VB/Class1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [#Const Directive](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/const-directive.md)\n- [If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)\n- [Conditional Compilation](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/conditional-compilation.md)\n- <xref:System.Diagnostics.ConditionalAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,521],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"#If...Then...#Else Directives (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 04/11/2018\nf1_keywords: \n  -
