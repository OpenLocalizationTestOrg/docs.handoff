[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides three line join styles: miter, bevel, and round. Line join style is a property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. When you specify a line join style for a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object, that join style will be applied to all the connected lines in any <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object drawn using that pen.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the results of the beveled line join example.  \n  \n ![Illustration that shows joined lines.](./media/how-to-join-lines/joined-beveled-lines.gif)  \n  \n## Example  \n You can specify the line join style by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. The example demonstrates a beveled line join between a horizontal line and a vertical line. In the following code, the value <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Bevel> assigned to the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration. The other members of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration are <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Miter> and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin.Round>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#31](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#31](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,412],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Join Lines\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
