This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment. If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/adc0bc0a-a519-4812-bafc-fb9d1a5801fc).  \n  \n## Key Properties, Methods, and Events  \n The length of the intervals is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property, whose value is in milliseconds. When the component is enabled, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event is raised every interval. This is where you would add code to be executed. For more information, see [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md). The key methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A>, which turn the timer on and off. When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer>   \n [Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/timer-component-windows-forms.md)   \n [Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,69],"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,57]}]},{"pos":[543,583],"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> is a component that raises an event at regular intervals.","pos":[584,693],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> is a component that raises an event at regular intervals."},{"content":"This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment.","pos":[694,753]},{"content":"If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to Server-Based Timers<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/adc0bc0a-a519-4812-bafc-fb9d1a5801fc)</ept>.","pos":[754,929],"source":" If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/adc0bc0a-a519-4812-bafc-fb9d1a5801fc)."},{"pos":[938,973],"content":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","linkify":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","nodes":[{"content":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"The length of the intervals is defined by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A&gt;</ph> property, whose value is in milliseconds.","pos":[977,1110],"source":"The length of the intervals is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property, whose value is in milliseconds."},{"content":"When the component is enabled, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick&gt;</ph> event is raised every interval.","pos":[1111,1216],"source":" When the component is enabled, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event is raised every interval."},{"content":"This is where you would add code to be executed.","pos":[1217,1265]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md)</ept>.","pos":[1266,1478],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md)."},{"content":"The key methods of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> component are <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A&gt;</ph>, which turn the timer on and off.","pos":[1479,1672],"source":" The key methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A>, which turn the timer on and off."},{"content":"When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[1673,1787],"source":" When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component."},{"pos":[1796,1804],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph>","pos":[1808,1841],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Timer Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/timer-component-windows-forms.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1845,1943],"source":" [Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/timer-component-windows-forms.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)</ept>","pos":[1946,2119],"source":" [Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)"}]}
