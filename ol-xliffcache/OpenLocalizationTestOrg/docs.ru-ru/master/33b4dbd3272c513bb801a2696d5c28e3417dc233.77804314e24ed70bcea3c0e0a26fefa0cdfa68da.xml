Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, all its contained controls move, too.  \n  \n The group box's caption is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property. For more information, see [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md).  \n  \n## GroupBox and Panel  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[560,601],"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[602,726],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[727,790]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[791,901]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control, all its contained controls move, too.","pos":[902,1141],"source":" Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue, and at design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the single <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, all its contained controls move, too."},{"content":"The group box's caption is defined by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[1148,1244],"source":"The group box's caption is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)</ept>.","pos":[1245,1437],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Set the Text Displayed by a Windows Forms Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-text-displayed-by-a-windows-forms-control.md)."},{"pos":[1446,1464],"content":"GroupBox and Panel","linkify":"GroupBox and Panel","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox and Panel","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control; however, only the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control displays a caption, and only the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control can have scroll bars.","pos":[1468,1737],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars."},{"pos":[1746,1754],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1758,1856],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
