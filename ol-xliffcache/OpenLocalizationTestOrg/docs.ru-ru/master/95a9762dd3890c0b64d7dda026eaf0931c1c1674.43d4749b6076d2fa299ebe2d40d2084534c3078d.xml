The constructor for the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class has parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol type that the socket uses to make connections.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates a Socket that can be used to communicate on a TCP/IP-based network, such as the Internet.  \n  \n```csharp  \nSocket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,   \n   SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nDim s as New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, _  \n   SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)  \n  \n```  \n  \n To use UDP instead of TCP, change the protocol type, as in the following example:  \n  \n```csharp  \nSocket s = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork,   \n   SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp);  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nDim s as New Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, _  \n   SocketType.Dgram, ProtocolType.Udp)  \n  \n```  \n  \n The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily> enumeration specifies the standard address families used by the **Socket** class to resolve network addresses (for example, the **AddressFamily.InterNetwork** member specifies the IP version 4 address family).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType> enumeration specifies the type of socket (for example, the **SocketType.Stream** member indicates a standard socket for sending and receiving data with flow control).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType> enumeration specifies the network protocol to use when communicating on the **Socket** (for example, **ProtocolType.Tcp** indicates that the socket uses TCP; **ProtocolType.Udp** indicates that the socket uses UDP).  \n  \n After a **Socket** is created, it can either initiate a connection to a remote endpoint or receive connections from remote devices.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Client Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-client-sockets.md)   \n [Listening with Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/listening-with-sockets.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,710],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Socket | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"How to: Create a Socket | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Socket | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]}],"pos":[6,49],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Create a Socket | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\n  - \"CSharp\"\n  - \"C++\"\n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application protocols, sockets\"\n  - \"Networking\"\n  - \"sending data, sockets\"\n  - \"data requests, sockets\"\n  - \"requesting data from Internet, sockets\"\n  - \"Socket class, creating sockets\"\n  - \"Network Resources\"\n  - \"receiving data, sockets\"\n  - \"protocols, sockets\"\n  - \"Internet, sockets\"\n  - \"sockets, creating\"\nms.assetid: c64a049c-5981-43bc-a2dc-1851473589c7\ncaps.latest.revision: 7\nauthor: \"mcleblanc\"\nms.author: \"markl\"\nmanager: \"markl\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[717,740],"content":"How to: Create a Socket","linkify":"How to: Create a Socket","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Socket","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Before you can use a socket to communicate with remote devices, the socket must be initialized with protocol and network address information.","pos":[741,882]},{"content":"The constructor for the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket&gt;</ph> class has parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol type that the socket uses to make connections.","pos":[883,1066],"source":" The constructor for the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class has parameters that specify the address family, socket type, and protocol type that the socket uses to make connections."},{"pos":[1075,1082],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates a Socket that can be used to communicate on a TCP/IP-based network, such as the Internet.","pos":[1086,1205]},{"content":"To use UDP instead of TCP, change the protocol type, as in the following example:","pos":[1443,1524]},{"pos":[1760,2013],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily&gt;</ph> enumeration specifies the standard address families used by the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> class to resolve network addresses (for example, the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>AddressFamily.InterNetwork<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> member specifies the IP version 4 address family).","source":"The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.AddressFamily> enumeration specifies the standard address families used by the **Socket** class to resolve network addresses (for example, the **AddressFamily.InterNetwork** member specifies the IP version 4 address family)."},{"pos":[2020,2227],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType&gt;</ph> enumeration specifies the type of socket (for example, the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SocketType.Stream<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> member indicates a standard socket for sending and receiving data with flow control).","source":"The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketType> enumeration specifies the type of socket (for example, the **SocketType.Stream** member indicates a standard socket for sending and receiving data with flow control)."},{"pos":[2234,2492],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Sockets.ProtocolType&gt;</ph> enumeration specifies the network protocol to use when communicating on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Socket<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> (for example, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>ProtocolType.Tcp<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> indicates that the socket uses TCP;
