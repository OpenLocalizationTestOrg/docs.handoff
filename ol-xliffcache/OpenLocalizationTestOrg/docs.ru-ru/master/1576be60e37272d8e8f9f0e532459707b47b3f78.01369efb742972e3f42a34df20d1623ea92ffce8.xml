A symbol remains defined in a source file until an [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md) directive in the source file removes the definition. When you use the /define option, an `#undef` directive in one file has no effect on other source code files in the project.  \n  \n You can use symbols created by this option with [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md), [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md), [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md), and [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md) to compile source files conditionally.  \n  \n **/d** is the short form of **/define**.  \n  \n You can define multiple symbols with **/define** by using a semicolon or comma to separate symbol names. For example:  \n  \n```  \n/define:DEBUG;TUESDAY  \n```  \n  \n The C# compiler itself defines no symbols or macros that you can use in your source code; all symbol definitions must be user-defined.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The C# `#define` does not allow a symbol to be given a value, as in languages such as C++. For example, `#define` cannot be used to create a macro or to define a constant. If you need to define a constant, use an `enum` variable. If you want to create a C++ style macro, consider alternatives such as generics. Since macros are notoriously error-prone, C# disallows their use but provides safer alternatives.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Properties** page.  \n  \n2.  On the **Build** tab, type the symbol that is to be defined in the **Conditional compilation symbols** box. For example, if you are using the code example that follows, just type `xx` into the text box.  \n  \n For information on how to set this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.CSharpProjectConfigurationProperties3.DefineConstants%2A>.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// preprocessor_define.cs  \n// compile with: /define:xx  \n// or uncomment the next line  \n// #define xx  \nusing System;  \npublic class Test   \n{  \n    public static void Main()   \n    {  \n        #if (xx)   \n            Console.WriteLine(\"xx defined\");  \n        #else  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"xx not defined\");  \n        #endif  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)   \n [NIB How to: Modify Project Properties and Configuration Settings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e7184bc5-2f2b-4b4f-aa9a-3ecfcbc48b67)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,717],"nodes":[{"content":"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]}],"pos":[6,55],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
