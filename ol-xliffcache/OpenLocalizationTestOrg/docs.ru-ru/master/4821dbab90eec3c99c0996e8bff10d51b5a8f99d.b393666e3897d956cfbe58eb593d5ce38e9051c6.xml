Member access (`.`) and dictionary member access (`!`) require an expression specifying the element that contains the member. This must appear immediately to the left of the accessor or as the target of a `With` block containing the member access.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30157  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the `With` block is correctly formatted.  \n  \n2.  If there is no `With` block, add an expression to the left of the accessor that evaluates to a defined element containing the member.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Special Characters in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/special-characters-in-code.md)\n- [With...End With Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,221],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30157\"\n  - \"bc30157\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30157\"\nms.assetid: 70daaee1-14f9-45b7-9f30-53794310b95e","nodes":[{"content":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","nodes":[{"content":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","pos":[0,60]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[228,288],"content":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","linkify":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","nodes":[{"content":"Leading '.' or '!' can only appear inside a 'With' statement","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"A period (.) or exclamation point (!) that is not inside a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block occurs without an expression on the left.","pos":[289,402],"source":"A period (.) or exclamation point (!) that is not inside a `With` block occurs without an expression on the left."},{"content":"Member access (<ph id=\"ph1\">`.`</ph>) and dictionary member access (<ph id=\"ph2\">`!`</ph>) require an expression specifying the element that contains the member.","pos":[403,528],"source":" Member access (`.`) and dictionary member access (`!`) require an expression specifying the element that contains the member."},{"content":"This must appear immediately to the left of the accessor or as the target of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block containing the member access.","pos":[529,650],"source":" This must appear immediately to the left of the accessor or as the target of a `With` block containing the member access."},{"pos":[657,678],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30157","source":"**Error ID:** BC30157"},{"pos":[687,708],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[718,770],"content":"Ensure that the <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block is correctly formatted.","source":"Ensure that the `With` block is correctly formatted."},{"pos":[780,913],"content":"If there is no <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block, add an expression to the left of the accessor that evaluates to a defined element containing the member.","source":"If there is no `With` block, add an expression to the left of the accessor that evaluates to a defined element containing the member."},{"pos":[922,930],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[934,1051],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Special Characters in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/special-characters-in-code.md)</ept>","source":"[Special Characters in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/special-characters-in-code.md)"},{"pos":[1054,1161],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>With...End With Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[With...End With Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)"}]}
