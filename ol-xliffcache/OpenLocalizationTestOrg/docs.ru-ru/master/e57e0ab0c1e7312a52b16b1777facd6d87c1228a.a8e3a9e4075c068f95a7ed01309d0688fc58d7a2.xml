This is in addition to any security schemas that may be in place already on your computer system. These can include those in the browser (such as the zone-based security available in Internet Explorer) or the operating system (such as the credential-based security of Windows NT).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Security in Windows Forms Overview](../../../docs/framework/winforms/security-in-windows-forms-overview.md)  \n Briefly explains the .NET Framework security model and the basic steps necessary to ensure the Windows Forms in your application are secure.  \n  \n [More Secure File and Data Access in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/more-secure-file-and-data-access-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes how to access files and data in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n [More Secure Printing in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/more-secure-printing-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes how to access printing features in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n [Additional Security Considerations in Windows Forms](../../../docs/framework/winforms/additional-security-considerations-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes performing window manipulation, using the Clipboard, and making calls to unmanaged code in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [NIB: Default Security Policy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2c086873-0894-4f4d-8f7e-47427c1a3b55)  \n Lists the default permissions granted in the Full Trust, Local Intranet, and Internet permission sets.  \n  \n [NIB: General Security Policy Administration](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/5121fe35-f0e3-402c-94ab-4f35b0a87b4b)  \n Gives information about the administering the .NET Framework security policy and elevating permissions.  \n  \n [Dangerous Permissions and Policy Administration](../../../docs/framework/misc/dangerous-permissions-and-policy-administration.md)  \n Discusses some of the.NET Framework permissions that can potentially allow the security system to be circumvented.  \n  \n [Secure Coding Guidelines](../../../docs/standard/security/secure-coding-guidelines.md)  \n Links to topics that explain the best practices for securely writing code against the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [NIB: Requesting Permissions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/0447c49d-8cba-45e4-862c-ff0b59bebdc2)  \n Discusses the use of attributes to let the runtime know what permissions your code needs to run.  \n  \n [Key Security Concepts](../../../docs/standard/security/key-security-concepts.md)  \n Links to topics that cover the basic aspects of code security.  \n  \n [Code Access Security Basics](../../../docs/framework/misc/code-access-security-basics.md)  \n Discusses the basics of working with the .NET Framework run time security policy.  \n  \n [NIB: Determining When to Modify Security Policy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/af749b17-e461-409d-84b9-a3d44789db16)  \n Explains how to determine when your applications need to diverge from the default security policy.  \n  \n [NIB: Deploying Security Policy](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f936c1e5-033b-4bd9-a3bd-a39ba733a681)  \n Discusses the best manner for
