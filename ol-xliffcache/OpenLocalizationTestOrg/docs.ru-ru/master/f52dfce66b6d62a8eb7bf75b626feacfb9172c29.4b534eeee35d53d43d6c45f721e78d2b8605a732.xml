The server is built with an asynchronous socket, so execution of the server application is not suspended while it waits for a connection from a client. The application receives a string from the client, displays the string on the console, and then echoes the string back to the client. The string from the client must contain the string \"\\<EOF>\" to signal the end of the message.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.Net  \nImports System.Net.Sockets  \nImports System.Text  \nImports System.Threading  \nImports Microsoft.VisualBasic  \n  \n' State object for reading client data asynchronously  \n  \nPublic Class StateObject  \n    ' Client  socket.  \n    Public workSocket As Socket = Nothing  \n    ' Size of receive buffer.  \n    Public Const BufferSize As Integer = 1024  \n    ' Receive buffer.  \n    Public buffer(BufferSize) As Byte  \n    ' Received data string.  \n    Public sb As New StringBuilder  \nEnd Class 'StateObject  \n  \nPublic Class AsynchronousSocketListener  \n    ' Thread signal.  \n    Public Shared allDone As New ManualResetEvent(False)  \n  \n    ' This server waits for a connection and then uses  asychronous operations to  \n    ' accept the connection, get data from the connected client,   \n    ' echo that data back to the connected client.  \n    ' It then disconnects from the client and waits for another client.   \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n        ' Establish the local endpoint for the socket.  \n        Dim ipHostInfo As IPHostEntry = Dns.GetHostEntry(Dns.GetHostName())  \n        Dim ipAddress As IPAddress = ipHostInfo.AddressList(0)  \n        Dim localEndPoint As New IPEndPoint(ipAddress, 11000)  \n  \n        ' Create a TCP/IP socket.  \n        Dim listener As New Socket(ipAddress.AddressFamily, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp)  \n  \n        ' Bind the socket to the local endpoint and listen for incoming connections.  \n        listener.Bind(localEndPoint)  \n        listener.Listen(100)  \n  \n        While True  \n            ' Set the event to nonsignaled state.  \n            allDone.Reset()  \n  \n            ' Start an asynchronous socket to listen for connections.  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Waiting for a connection...\")  \n            listener.BeginAccept(New AsyncCallback(AddressOf AcceptCallback), listener)  \n  \n            ' Wait until a connection is made and processed before continuing.  \n            allDone.WaitOne()  \n        End While  \n    End Sub 'Main  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub AcceptCallback(ByVal ar As IAsyncResult)  \n        ' Get the socket that handles the client request.  \n        Dim listener As Socket = CType(ar.AsyncState, Socket)  \n        ' End the operation.  \n        Dim handler As Socket = listener.EndAccept(ar)  \n  \n        ' Create the state object for the async receive.  \n        Dim state As New StateObject  \n        state.workSocket = handler  \n        handler.BeginReceive(state.buffer, 0, StateObject.BufferSize, 0, New AsyncCallback(AddressOf ReadCallback), state)  \n    End Sub 'AcceptCallback  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub ReadCallback(ByVal ar As IAsyncResult)  \n        Dim content As String = String.Empty  \n  \n        ' Retrieve the state object and the handler socket  \n        ' from the asynchronous state object.  \n        Dim state As StateObject = CType(ar.AsyncState, StateObject)  \n        Dim handler As Socket = state.workSocket  \n  \n        ' Read data from the client socket.   \n        Dim bytesRead As Integer = handler.EndReceive(ar)  \n  \n        If bytesRead > 0 Then  \n            ' There  might be more data, so store the data received so far.  \n            state.sb.Append(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(state.buffer, 0, bytesRead))  \n  \n            ' Check for end-of-file tag.
