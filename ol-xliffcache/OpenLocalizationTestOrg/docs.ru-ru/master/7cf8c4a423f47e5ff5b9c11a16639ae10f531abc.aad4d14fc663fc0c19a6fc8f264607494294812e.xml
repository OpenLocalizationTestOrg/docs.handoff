The increment and decrement expressions take the following form:  \n  \n```  \n++p;  \np++;  \n--p;  \np--;  \n```  \n  \n The increment and decrement operators can be applied to pointers of any type except the type `void*`.  \n  \n The effect of applying the increment operator to a pointer of the type `pointer-type` is to add [sizeof](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/sizeof.md) (`pointer-type`) to the address that is contained in the pointer variable.  \n  \n The effect of applying the decrement operator to a pointer of the type `pointer-type` is to subtract `sizeof` (`pointer-type`) from the address that is contained in the pointer variable.  \n  \n No exceptions are generated when the operation overflows the domain of the pointer, and the result depends on the implementation.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, you step through an array by incrementing the pointer by the size of `int`. With each step, you display the address and the content of the array element.  \n  \n
