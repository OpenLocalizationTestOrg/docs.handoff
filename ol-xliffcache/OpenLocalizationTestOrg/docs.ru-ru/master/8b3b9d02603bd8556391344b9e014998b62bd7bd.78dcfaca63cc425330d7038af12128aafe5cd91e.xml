One member of the pair is implemented by the host, and the other member is implemented by the CLR. As a host-side implementation, the `IHostSyncManager` interface corresponds to the `ICLRSyncManager` interface implemented by the CLR. The CLR calls `SetCLRSyncManager` to supply an `ICLRSyncManager` instance for the host to associate with the current `IHostSyncManager` instance.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
