Create a delegate named `MySubDelegate`.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Delegate Sub MySubDelegate(ByVal x As Integer)  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Class class1  \n        Sub Sub1(ByVal x As Integer)  \n            MsgBox(\"The value of x is: \" & CStr(x))  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in `Invoke` method.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Protected Sub DelegateTest()  \n        Dim c1 As New class1  \n        ' Create an instance of the delegate.  \n        Dim msd As MySubDelegate = AddressOf c1.Sub1  \n        ' Call the method.  \n        msd.Invoke(10)  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Delegate Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)   \n [Delegates](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)   \n [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)   \n [Multithreaded Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a06a1a56-dd16-44e8-bc01-2c2255511bc6)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,76],"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]},{"pos":[549,596],"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to associate a method with a delegate and then invoke that method through the delegate.","pos":[597,707]},{"pos":[717,760],"content":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","linkify":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","nodes":[{"content":"Create the delegate and matching procedures","pos":[0,43]}]},{"pos":[770,810],"content":"Create a delegate named <ph id=\"ph1\">`MySubDelegate`</ph>.","source":"Create a delegate named `MySubDelegate`."},{"content":"Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.","pos":[896,975]},{"pos":[1154,1303],"content":"Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in <ph id=\"ph1\">`Invoke`</ph> method.","source":"Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in `Invoke` method."},{"pos":[1572,1580],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1584,1683],"source":"[Delegate Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Delegates<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1686,1780],"source":" [Delegates](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1783,1871],"source":" [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Multithreaded Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a06a1a56-dd16-44e8-bc01-2c2255511bc6)</ept>","pos":[1874,1975],"source":" [Multithreaded Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a06a1a56-dd16-44e8-bc01-2c2255511bc6)"}]}
