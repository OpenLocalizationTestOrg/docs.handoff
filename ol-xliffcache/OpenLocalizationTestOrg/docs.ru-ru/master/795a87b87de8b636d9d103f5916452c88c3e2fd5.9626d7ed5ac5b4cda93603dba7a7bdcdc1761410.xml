Types of all properties are inferred. In the following example, the types of `Name` and `Price` are inferred directly from the values that are used to initialize them.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#1](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_1.vb)]  \n  \n Anonymous types can also infer property names and types from other sources. The sections that follow provide a list of the circumstances where inference is possible, and examples of situations where it is not.  \n  \n## Successful Inference  \n  \n#### Anonymous types can infer property names and types from the following sources:  \n  \n-   From variable names. Anonymous type `anonProduct` will have two properties, `productName` and `productPrice`. Their data types will be those of the original variables, `String` and `Double`, respectively.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#11](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_2.vb)]  \n  \n-   From property or field names of other objects. For example, consider a `car` object of a `CarClass` type that includes `Name` and `ID` properties. To create a new anonymous type instance, `car1`, with `Name` and `ID` properties that are initialized with the values from the `car` object, you can write the following:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#34](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_3.vb)]  \n  \n     The previous declaration is equivalent to the longer line of code that defines anonymous type `car2`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#35](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_4.vb)]  \n  \n-   From XML member names.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#12](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_5.vb)]  \n  \n     The resulting type for `anon` would have one property, `Book`, of type <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>(Of XElement).  \n  \n-   From a function that has no parameters, such as `SomeFunction` in the following example.  \n  \n     `Dim sc As New SomeClass`  \n  \n     `Dim anon1 = New With {Key sc.SomeFunction()}`  \n  \n     The variable `anon2` in the following code is an anonymous type that has one property, a character named `First`. This code will display a letter \"E,\" the letter that is returned by function <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.First%2A>.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#13](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_6.vb)]  \n  \n## Inference Failures  \n  \n#### Name inference will fail in many circumstances, including the following:  \n  \n-   The inference derives from the invocation of a method, a constructor, or a parameterized property that requires arguments. The previous declaration of `anon1` fails if `someFunction` has one or more arguments.  \n  \n     `' Not valid.`  \n  \n     `' Dim anon3 = New With {Key sc.someFunction(someArg)}`  \n  \n     Assignment to a new property name solves the problem.  \n  \n     `' Valid.`  \n  \n     `Dim anon4 = New With {Key .FunResult = sc.someFunction(someArg)}`  \n  \n-   The inference derives from a complex expression.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Dim aString As String = \"Act \"  \n    ' Not valid.  \n    ' Dim label = New With {Key aString & \"IV\"}  \n    ```  \n  \n     The error can be resolved by assigning the result of the expression to a property name.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#14](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_7.vb)]  \n  \n-   Inference for multiple properties produces two or more properties that have the same name. Referring back to declarations in earlier examples, you cannot list both `product.Name` and `car1.Name` as properties of the same anonymous type. This is because the inferred identifier for each of these would be `Name`.  \n  \n     `' Not valid.`  \n  \n     `' Dim anon5 = New With {Key product.Name, Key car1.Name}`  \n  \n     The problem can be solved by assigning the values to distinct property names.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#36](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_8.vb)]  \n  \n     Note that changes in case (changes between uppercase and lowercase letters) do not make two names distinct.  \n  \n     `Dim price = 0`  \n  \n     `' Not valid, because Price and price are the same name.`  \n  \n     `' Dim anon7 = New With {Key product.Price, Key price}`  \n  \n-   The initial type and value of one property depends on another property that is not yet established. For example, `.IDName = .LastName` is not valid in an anonymous type declaration unless `.LastName` is already initialized.  \n  \n     `' Not valid.`  \n  \n     `' Dim anon8 = New With {Key .IDName = .LastName, Key .LastName = \"Jones\"}`  \n  \n     In this example, you can fix the problem by reversing the order in which the properties are declared.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrAnonymousTypes#15](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations_9.vb)]  \n  \n-   A property name of the anonymous type is the same as the name of a member of <xref:System.Object>. For example, the following declaration fails because `Equals` is a method of <xref:System.Object>.  \n  \n     `' Not valid.`  \n  \n     `' Dim relationsLabels1 = New With {Key .Equals = \"equals\", Key .Greater = _`  \n  \n     `'                       \"greater than\", Key .Less = \"less than\"}`  \n  \n     You can fix the problem by changing the property name:  \n  \n
