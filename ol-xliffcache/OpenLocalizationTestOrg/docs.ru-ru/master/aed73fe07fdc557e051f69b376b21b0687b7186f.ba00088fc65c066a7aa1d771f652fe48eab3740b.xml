These are added through additions to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.StatusBarPanelCollection> class.  \n  \n### To add panels to a status bar  \n  \n1.  In a procedure, create status-bar panels by adding them to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.StatusBarPanelCollection>. Specify property settings for individual panels by using its index passed through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.Panels%2A> property.  \n  \n     In the following code example, the path set for the location of the icon is the **My Documents** folder. This location is used because you can assume that most computers running the Windows operating system will include this folder. Choosing this location also allows users with minimal system access levels to safely run the application. The following example requires a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control already added.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.StatusBarPanelCollection> is a zero-based collection, so code should proceed accordingly.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Sub CreateStatusBarPanels()  \n    ' Create panels and set text property.  \n       StatusBar1.Panels.Add(\"One\")  \n       StatusBar1.Panels.Add(\"Two\")  \n       StatusBar1.Panels.Add(\"Three\")  \n    ' Set properties of StatusBar panels.  \n    ' Set AutoSize property of panels.  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(0).AutoSize = StatusBarPanelAutoSize.Spring  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(1).AutoSize = StatusBarPanelAutoSize.Contents  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(2).AutoSize = StatusBarPanelAutoSize.Contents  \n    ' Set BorderStyle property of panels.  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(0).BorderStyle = StatusBarPanelBorderStyle.Raised  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(1).BorderStyle = StatusBarPanelBorderStyle.Sunken  \n       StatusBar1.Panels(2).BorderStyle = StatusBarPanelBorderStyle.Raised  \n    ' Set Icon property of third panel.
