You can make the reference either at compile time (early binding) or at run time.  \n  \n A compile-time reference occurs when you indicate to the compiler that your assembly explicitly references another assembly. When you use compile-time referencing, the compiler automatically gets the public key of the targeted strong-named assembly and places it in the assembly reference of the assembly being compiled.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A strong-named assembly can only use types from other strong-named assemblies. Otherwise, the security of the strong-named assembly would be compromised.  \n  \n### To make a compile-time reference to a strong-named assembly  \n  \n1.  At the command prompt, type the following command:  \n  \n     \\<*compiler command*> **/reference:**\\<*assembly name*>  \n  \n     In this command, *compiler command* is the compiler command for the language you are using, and *assembly name* is the name of the strong-named assembly being referenced. You can also use other compiler options, such as the **/t:library** option for creating a library assembly.  \n  \n The following example creates an assembly called `myAssembly.dll` that references a strong-named assembly called `myLibAssembly.dll` from a code module called `myAssembly.cs`.  \n  \n```  \ncsc /t:library myAssembly.cs /reference:myLibAssembly.dll  \n```  \n  \n### To make a run-time reference to a strong-named assembly  \n  \n1.  When you make a run-time reference to a strong-named assembly (for example, by using the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method), you must use the display name of the referenced strong-named assembly. The syntax of a display name is as follows:  \n  \n     \\<*assembly name*>**,** \\<*version number*>**,** \\<*culture*>**,** \\<*public key token*>  \n  \n     For example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    myDll, Version=1.1.0.0, Culture=en, PublicKeyToken=03689116d3a4ae33   \n    ```  \n  \n     In this example, `PublicKeyToken` is the hexadecimal form of the public key token. If there is no culture value, use `Culture=neutral`.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to use this information with the <xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/CPP/load2.cpp#3)]\n [!code-csharp[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/CS/load2.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[Assembly.Load1#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Assembly.Load1/VB/load2.vb#3)]  \n  \n You can print the hexadecimal format of the public key and public key token for a specific assembly by using the following [Strong Name (Sn.exe)](../../../docs/framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md) command:  \n  \n **sn -Tp \\<** *assembly* **>**  \n  \n If you have a public key file, you can use the following command instead (note the difference in case on the command-line option):  \n  \n **sn -tp \\<** *assembly* **>**  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/create-and-use-strong-named-assemblies.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,569],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-bcl\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"strong-named assemblies, compile-time references\"\n  - \"compile-time assembly referencing\"\n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], strong-named\"\n  - \"assembly binding, strong-named\"\nms.assetid: 4c6a406a-b5eb-44fa-b4ed-4e95bb95a813\ncaps.latest.revision: 14\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[576,617],"content":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly","linkify":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"The process for referencing types or resources in a strong-named assembly is usually transparent.","pos":[618,715]},{"content":"You can make the reference either at compile time (early binding) or at run time.","pos":[716,797]},{"content":"A compile-time reference occurs when you indicate to the compiler that your assembly explicitly references another assembly.","pos":[804,928]},{"content":"When you use compile-time referencing, the compiler automatically gets the public key of the targeted strong-named assembly and places it in the assembly reference of the assembly being compiled.","pos":[929,1124]},{"pos":[1132,1296],"content":"[!NOTE]\n A strong-named assembly can only use types from other strong-named assemblies.
