If both assemblies are identical, try replacing these references so both references are from the same location.  \n  \n Code in your project accesses a member of another project, but the configuration of your solution does not allow the Visual Basic compiler to resolve the reference.  \n  \n To access a type defined in another assembly, the Visual Basic compiler must have a reference to that assembly.

Determine which project produces the best assembly for your project to reference. For this decision, you might use criteria such as ease of file access and frequency of updates.  \n  \n2.
