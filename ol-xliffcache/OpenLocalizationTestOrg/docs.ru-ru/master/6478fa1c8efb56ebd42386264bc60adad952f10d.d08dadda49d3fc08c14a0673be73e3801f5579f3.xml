You can wrap the control's contents from one row to the next, or from one column to the next. Alternately, you can clip instead of wrap its contents.  \n  \n You can specify the flow direction by setting the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel.FlowDirection%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control correctly reverses its flow direction in Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts. You can also specify whether the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control's contents are wrapped or clipped by setting the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel.WrapContents%2A> property.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control automatically sizes to its contents when you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AutoSize%2A> property to `true`. It also provides a **FlowBreak** property to its child controls. Setting the value of the FlowBreak property to `true` causes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control to stop laying out controls in the current flow direction and wrap to the next row or column.  \n  \n Any Windows Forms control can be a child of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control, including other instances of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel>. With this capability, you can construct sophisticated layouts that adapt to your form's dimensions at run time.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a FlowLayoutPanel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/z9w7ek2f\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel.FlowDirection%2A>   \n
