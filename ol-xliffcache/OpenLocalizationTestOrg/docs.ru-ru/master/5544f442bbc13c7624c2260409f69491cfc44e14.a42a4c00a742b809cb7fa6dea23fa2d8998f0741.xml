An expression that determines whether the values for the current item in the collection are included in the output collection. The expression must evaluate to a `Boolean` value or the equivalent of a `Boolean` value. If the condition evaluates to `True`, the element is included in the query result; otherwise, the element is excluded from the query result.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `Where` clause enables you to filter query data by selecting only elements that meet certain criteria. Elements whose values cause the `Where` clause to evaluate to `True` are included in the query result; other elements are excluded. The expression that is used in a `Where` clause must evaluate to a `Boolean` or the equivalent of a `Boolean`, such as an Integer that evaluates to `False` when its value is zero. You can combine multiple expressions in a `Where` clause by using logical operators such as `And`, `Or`, `AndAlso`, `OrElse`, `Is`, and `IsNot`.  \n  \n By default, query expressions are not evaluated until they are accessed—for example, when they are data-bound or iterated through in a `For` loop. As a result, the `Where` clause is not evaluated until the query is accessed. If you have values external to the query that are used in the `Where` clause, ensure that the appropriate value is used in the `Where` clause at the time the query is executed. For more information about query execution, see [Writing Your First LINQ Query](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/writing-your-first-linq-query.md).  \n  \n You can call functions within a `Where` clause to perform a calculation or operation on a value from the current element in the collection. Calling a function in a `Where` clause can cause the query to be executed immediately when it is defined instead of when it is accessed. For more information about query execution, see [Writing Your First LINQ Query](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/writing-your-first-linq-query.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following query expression uses a `From` clause to declare a range variable `cust` for each `Customer` object in the `customers` collection. The `Where` clause uses the range variable to restrict the output to customers from the specified region. The `For Each` loop displays the company name for each customer in the query result.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbSimpleQuerySamples#23](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/codesnippet/VisualBasic/where-clause_1.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses `And` and `Or` logical operators in the `Where` clause.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbSimpleQuerySamples#31](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/codesnippet/VisualBasic/where-clause_2.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n
