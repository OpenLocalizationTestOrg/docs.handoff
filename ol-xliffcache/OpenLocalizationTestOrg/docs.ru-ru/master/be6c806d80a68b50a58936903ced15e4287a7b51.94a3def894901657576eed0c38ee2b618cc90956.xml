However, the lengths of the respective dimensions do not need to be the same.  \n  \n-   **Element Data Type.** The data types of the elements of both arrays must be reference types. You cannot convert an `Integer` array to a `Long` array, or even to an `Object` array, because at least one value type is involved. For more information, see [Value Types and Reference Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/value-types-and-reference-types.md).  \n  \n-   **Convertibility.** A conversion, either widening or narrowing, must be possible between the element types of the two arrays. An example that fails this requirement is an attempted conversion between a `String` array and an array of a class derived from <xref:System.Attribute?displayProperty=fullName>. These two types have nothing in common, and no conversion of any kind exists between them.  \n  \n A conversion of one array type to another is widening or narrowing depending on whether the conversion of the respective elements is widening or narrowing. For more information, see [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md).  \n  \n## Conversion to an Object Array  \n When you declare an `Object` array without initializing it, its element type is `Object` as long as it remains uninitialized. When you set it to an array of a specific class, it takes on the type of that class. However, its underlying type is still `Object`, and you can subsequently set it to another array of an unrelated class. Since all classes derive from `Object`, you can change the array's element type from any class to any other class.  \n  \n In the following example, no conversion exists between types `student` and `String`, but both derive from `Object`, so all assignments are valid.  \n  \n```  \n' Assume student has already been defined as a class.  \nDim testArray() As Object  \n' testArray is still an Object array at this point.  \nDim names() As String = New String(3) {\"Name0\", \"Name1\", \"Name2\", \"Name3\"}  \ntestArray = New student(3) {}  \n' testArray is now of type student().  \ntestArray = names  \n' testArray is now a String array.  \n```  \n  \n### Underlying Type of an Array  \n If you originally declare an array with a specific class, its underlying element type is that class. If you subsequently set it to an array of another class, there must be a conversion between the two classes.  \n  \n In the following example, `students` is a `student` array. Since no conversion exists between `String` and `student`, the last statement fails.  \n  \n```  \nDim students() As student  \nDim names() As String = New String(3) {\"Name0\", \"Name1\", \"Name2\", \"Name3\"}  \nstudents = New Student(3) {}  \n' The following statement fails at compile time.  \nstudents = names  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Data
