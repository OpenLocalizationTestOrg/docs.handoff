Both the client and the service are authenticated with certificates. For more information, see [Distributed Application Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/distributed-application-security.md).\n\n ![Screenshot that shows a client with certificate.](./media/message-security-with-a-certificate-client/client-with-certificate.gif)  \n  \n For a sample application, see [Message Security Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/message-security-certificate.md).  \n\n|Characteristic|Description|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|Security Mode|Message|  \n|Interoperability|WCF only|  \n|Authentication (Server)|Using service certificate|  \n|Authentication (Client)|Using client certificate|  \n|Integrity|Yes|  \n|Confidentiality|Yes|  \n|Transport|HTTP|  \n|Binding|<xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>|  \n  \n## Service  \n The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:  \n  \n-   Create a stand-alone service using the code with no configuration.  \n  \n-   Create a service using the supplied configuration, but do not define any endpoints.  \n  \n### Code  \n The following code shows how to create a service endpoint that uses message security to establish a secure context.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[C_SecurityScenarios#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#10)]\n [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#10)]  \n  \n### Configuration  \n The following configuration can be used instead of the code.  \n  \n```xml  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>  \n<configuration>  \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"ServiceCredentialsBehavior\">  \n          <serviceCredentials>  \n            <serviceCertificate findValue=\"Contoso.com\"  \n                                x509FindType=\"FindBySubjectName\" />  \n          </serviceCredentials>  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    <services>  \n      <service behaviorConfiguration=\"ServiceCredentialsBehavior\"   \n               name=\"ServiceModel.Calculator\">  \n        <endpoint address=\"http://localhost/Calculator\"   \n                  binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                  bindingConfiguration=\"MessageAndCerficiateClient\"   \n                  name=\"SecuredByClientCertificate\"  \n                  contract=\"ServiceModel.ICalculator\" />  \n      </service>  \n    </services>  \n    <bindings>  \n      <wsHttpBinding>  \n        <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\">  \n          <security mode=\"Message\">  \n            <message clientCredentialType=\"Certificate\" />  \n          </security>  \n        </binding>  \n      </wsHttpBinding>  \n    </bindings>  \n    <client />  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## Client  \n The following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:  \n  \n-   Create a stand-alone client using the code (and client code).  \n  \n-   Create a client that does not define any endpoint addresses. Instead, use the client constructor that takes the configuration name as an argument. For example:  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_SecurityScenarios#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#0)]\n     [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#0)]  \n  \n### Code  \n The following code creates the client.

For more information about certificates, see [Working with Certificates](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/working-with-certificates.md). The code also uses an <`identity`> element to specify a Domain Name System (DNS) of the expected server identity.
