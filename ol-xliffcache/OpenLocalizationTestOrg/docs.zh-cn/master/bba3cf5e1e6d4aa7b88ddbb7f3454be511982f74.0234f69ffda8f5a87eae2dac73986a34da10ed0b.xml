Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Bankov, Peter  \n    Holm, Michael  \n    Garcia, Hugo  \n    Potra, Cristina  \n    Noriega, Fabricio  \n    Aw, Kam Foo  \n    Beebe, Ann  \n    Toyoshima, Tim  \n    Guy, Wey Yuan  \n    Garcia, Debra  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names2.txt and save it in your project folder: Note that the two files have some names in common.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Liu, Jinghao  \n    Bankov, Peter  \n    Holm, Michael  \n    Garcia, Hugo  \n    Beebe, Ann  \n    Gilchrist, Beth  \n    Myrcha, Jacek  \n    Giakoumakis, Leo  \n    McLin, Nkenge  \n    El Yassir, Mehdi  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass SplitWithGroups  \n{  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n        string[] fileA = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@\"../../../names1.txt\");  \n        string[] fileB = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@\"../../../names2.txt\");  \n  \n        // Concatenate and remove duplicate names based on  \n        // default string comparer  \n        var mergeQuery = fileA.Union(fileB);  \n  \n        // Group the names by the first letter in the last name.  \n        var groupQuery = from name in mergeQuery  \n                         let n = name.Split(',')  \n                         group name by n[0][0] into g  \n                         orderby g.Key  \n                         select g;  \n  \n        // Create a new file for each group that was created  \n        // Note that nested foreach loops are required to access  \n        // individual items with each group.  \n        foreach (var g in groupQuery)  \n        {  \n            // Create the new file name.  \n            string fileName = @\"../../../testFile_\" + g.Key + \".txt\";  \n  \n            // Output to display.  \n            Console.WriteLine(g.Key);  \n  \n            // Write file.  \n            using (System.IO.StreamWriter sw = new System.IO.StreamWriter(fileName))  \n            {  \n                foreach (var item in g)  \n                {  \n                    sw.WriteLine(item);  \n                    // Output to console for example purposes.  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"   {0}\", item);  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n        // Keep console window open in debug mode.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Files have been written.
