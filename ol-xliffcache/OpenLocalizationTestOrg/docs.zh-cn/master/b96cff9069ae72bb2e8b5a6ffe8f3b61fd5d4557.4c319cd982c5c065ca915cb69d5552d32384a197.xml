Commonly, applications enable you to right-click this icon to send commands to the application it represents. By associating a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> component with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component, you can add this functionality to your applications.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you want your application to be minimized at startup while displaying an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component in the taskbar, set the main form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.WindowState%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormWindowState> and be sure the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.Visible%2A> property is set to `true`.  \n  \n### To associate a shortcut menu with the NotifyIcon component at design time  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component to your form, and set the important properties, such as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.Icon%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.Visible%2A> properties.  \n  \n     For more information, see [How to: Add Application Icons to the TaskBar with the Windows Forms NotifyIcon Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/app-icons-to-the-taskbar-with-wf-notifyicon.md).  \n  \n2.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> component to your Windows Form.  \n  \n     Add menu items to the shortcut menu representing the commands you want to make available at run time. This is also a good time to add menu enhancements to these menu items, such as access keys.  \n  \n3.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.ContextMenu%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component to the shortcut menu that you added.  \n  \n     With this property set, the shortcut menu will be displayed when the icon on the taskbar is clicked.  \n  \n### To associate a shortcut menu with the NotifyIcon component programmatically  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> class and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> class, with whatever property settings are necessary for the application (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.Icon%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.Visible%2A> properties for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component, menu items for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu> component).  \n  \n2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon.ContextMenu%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.NotifyIcon> component to the shortcut menu that you added.  \n  \n     With this property set, the shortcut menu will be displayed when the icon on the taskbar is clicked.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The following code example creates a basic menu structure. You will need to customize the menu choices to those that fit the application you are developing. Additionally, you will want to write code to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuItem.Click> events for these menu items.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public ContextMenu1 As New ContextMenu  \n    Public NotifyIcon1 As New NotifyIcon  \n  \n    Public Sub CreateIconMenuStructure()  \n       ' Add menu items to shortcut menu.  \n       ContextMenu1.MenuItems.Add(\"&Open Application\")  \n

\"Right-click me!\"  \n       NotifyIcon1.Visible = True  \n       NotifyIcon1.ContextMenu = ContextMenu1  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic NotifyIcon notifyIcon1 = new

notifyIcon1->ContextMenu = contextMenu1;  \n   }  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You must initialize `notifyIcon1` and `contextMenu1,` which you can do by including the following statements in the constructor of your form:  \n  \n```cpp  \nnotifyIcon1 = gcnew System::Windows::Forms::NotifyIcon();  \ncontextMenu1 = gcnew System::Windows::Forms::ContextMenu();  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n
