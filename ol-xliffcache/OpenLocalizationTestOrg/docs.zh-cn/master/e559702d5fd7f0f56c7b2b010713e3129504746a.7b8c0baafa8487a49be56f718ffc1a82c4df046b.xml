The panels are made resizable by a splitter. This arrangement of controls is very effective for displaying and browsing information.  \n  \n The following steps show how to arrange controls in a Windows Explorer-like form. They do not show how to add the file-browsing functionality of the Windows Explorer application.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To create a Windows Explorer-style Windows Form  \n  \n1.  Create a new Windows Application project (**File** > **New** > **Project** > **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** > **Classic Desktop** > **Windows Forms Application**).  \n  \n2.  From the **Toolbox**:  \n  \n    1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control onto your form.  \n  \n    2.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control into **SplitterPanel1** (the panel of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control marked **Panel1**).  \n  \n    3.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control into **SplitterPanel2** (the panel of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control marked **Panel2**).  \n  \n3.  Select all three controls by pressing the CTRL key and clicking them in turn. When you select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control, click the splitter bar, rather than the panels.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Do not use the **Select All** command on the **Edit** menu. If you do so, the property needed in the next step will not appear in the **Properties** window.  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>.  \n  \n5.  Press F5 to run the application.  \n  \n     The form displays a two-part user interface, similar to that of the Windows Explorer.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  When you drag the splitter, the panels resize themselves.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>\n- [How to: Create a Multipane User Interface with Windows Forms](how-to-create-a-multipane-user-interface-with-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window](how-to-define-resize-and-positioning-behavior-in-a-split-window.md)\n- [How to: Split a Window Horizontally](how-to-split-a-window-horizontally.md)\n- [SplitContainer Control](splitcontainer-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,363],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Explorer [Windows Forms], creating with Windows Forms\"\n  - \"SplitContainer control [Windows Forms], Explorer-style interface\"\n  - \"forms [Windows Forms], Windows Explorer type\"\nms.assetid: 9a3d5f4f-5dda-4350-9ad5-57ce5976dc47","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","pos":[0,67]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[370,437],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","linkify":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Windows Explorer is a common user-interface choice for applications because of its ready familiarity.","pos":[438,539]},{"content":"Windows Explorer is, essentially, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control and a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control on separate panels.","pos":[546,697],"source":"Windows Explorer is, essentially, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control on separate panels."},{"content":"The panels are made resizable by a splitter.","pos":[698,742]},{"content":"This arrangement of controls is very effective for displaying and browsing information.","pos":[743,830]},{"content":"The following steps show how to arrange controls in a Windows Explorer-like form.","pos":[837,918]},{"content":"They do not show how to add the file-browsing functionality of the Windows Explorer application.","pos":[919,1015]},{"pos":[1023,1368],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
