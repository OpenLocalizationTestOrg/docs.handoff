See [Enhanced Strong Naming](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/enhanced-strong-naming.md) for a description of those changes.  \n  \n The .NET Framework provides a two-tier security model for managed applications. [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps run in a Windows security container that limits access to resources. Within that container, managed applications run fully trusted. From a code access security (CAS) perspective, there is nothing a developer can do to elevate privileges. For information about the privileges granted by Windows, see [App capability declarations (Windows Store apps)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230436) in the Windows Dev Center.
