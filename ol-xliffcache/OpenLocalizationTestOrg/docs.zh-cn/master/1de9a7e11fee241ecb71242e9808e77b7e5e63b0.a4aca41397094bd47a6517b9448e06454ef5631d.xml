To make an element transparent or semi-transparent, you set its <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property. A value of `0.0` makes the element completely transparent, while a value of `1.0` makes the element completely opaque. A value of `0.5` makes the element 50% opaque, and so on. An element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> is set to `1.0` by default.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example sets the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> of a button to `0.25`, making it and its contents (in this case, the button's text) 25% opaque.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[brushsamples_snip#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_snip/CS/OpacityExample.xaml#2)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[brushsamples_procedural_snip#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_procedural_snip/CSharp/OpacityExample.cs#2)]  \n  \n If an element's contents have their own <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> settings, those values are multiplied against the containing elements <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A>.  \n  \n The following example sets a button's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> to `0.25`, and the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> of an <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image> control contained with in the button to `0.5`. As a result, the image appears 12.5% opaque: 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[brushsamples_snip#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_snip/CS/OpacityExample.xaml#3)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[brushsamples_procedural_snip#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_procedural_snip/CSharp/OpacityExample.cs#3)]  \n  \n Another way to control the opacity of an element is to set the opacity of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush> that paints the element. This approach enables you to selectively alter the opacity of portions of an element, and provides performance benefits over using the element's <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.Opacity%2A> property. The following example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Brush.Opacity%2A> of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush> used to paint the button's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> is set to `0.25`. As a result, the brush's background is 25% opaque, but its contents (the button's text) remain 100% opaque.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[brushsamples_snip#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_snip/CS/OpacityExample.xaml#4)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[brushsamples_procedural_snip#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/brushsamples_procedural_snip/CSharp/OpacityExample.cs#4)]  \n  \n You may also control the opacity of individual colors within a brush.
