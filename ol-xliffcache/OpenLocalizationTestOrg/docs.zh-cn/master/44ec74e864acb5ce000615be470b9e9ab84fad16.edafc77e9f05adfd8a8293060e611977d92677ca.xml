To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim number? As Integer = 5  \n\nIf number IsNot Nothing Then  \n  If number.GetType() Is Type.GetType(\"System.Int32\") Then   \n\n  End If  \nEnd If  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Nullable Value Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)   \n [Is Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,674],"nodes":[{"content":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,153],"content":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;Is&amp;#39; operand of type &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; can only be compared to &amp;#39;Nothing&amp;#39;, because &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,153],"source":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs"}]}],"pos":[6,162],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32127\"\n  - \"bc32127\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32127\"\nms.assetid: 68b745b5-8605-4bf3-a6ec-69e67b3cff2d\ncaps.latest.revision: 5\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"\ntranslation.priority.mt: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[681,817],"content":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type","linkify":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;Is&amp;#39; operand of type &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; can only be compared to &amp;#39;Nothing&amp;#39;, because &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; is a nullable type","pos":[0,136],"source":"&#39;Is&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type"}]},{"pos":[818,933],"content":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Is`</ph> operator.","source":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator."},{"pos":[940,961],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32127","source":"**Error ID:** BC32127"},{"pos":[970,991],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[999,1215],"content":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Is`</ph> operator, call the <ph id=\"ph3\">`GetType`</ph> method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.","source":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[1385,1393],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Nullable Value Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1397,1511],"source":"[Nullable Value Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Is Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)</ept>","pos":[1515,1592],"source":"[Is Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)"}]}
