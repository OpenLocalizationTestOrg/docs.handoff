Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property. You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code.

Likewise, disabling a menu item that has submenu items disables the submenu items. If all the commands on a given menu are unavailable to the user, it is considered good programming practice to both hide and disable the entire menu, as this presents a clean user interface. You should both hide and disable the menu, as hiding alone does not prevent access to a menu command via a shortcut key.
