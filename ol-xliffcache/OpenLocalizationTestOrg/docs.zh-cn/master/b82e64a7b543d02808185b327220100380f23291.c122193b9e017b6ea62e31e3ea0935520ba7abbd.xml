[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web service clients do not support MTOM message encoding, so the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding.MessageEncoding%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property should be left as its default value, which is <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSMessageEncoding?displayProperty=fullName>. ASP.Net Web Service clients do not support WS-Security, so the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding.Security%2A?displayProperty=fullName> should be set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurityMode>.  \n  \n To make the metadata for a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service available to [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web service proxy generation tools (that is, [Web Services Description Language Tool (Wsdl.exe)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=73833), [Web Services Discovery Tool (Disco.exe)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=73834), and the Add Web Reference feature in Visual Studio), you should expose an HTTP/GET metadata endpoint.  \n  \n### To add a WCF endpoint that is compatible with ASP.NET Web service clients in code  \n  \n1.  Create a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> instance  \n  \n2.  Optionally enable transport security for this service endpoint binding by setting the security mode for the binding to <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurityMode>. For details, please see [Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security.md).  \n  \n3.  Add a new application endpoint to your service host using the binding instance that you just created. For details about how to add a service endpoint in code, see the [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-code.md).  \n  \n4.  Enable an HTTP/GET metadata endpoint for your service. For details see [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md).  \n  \n### To add a WCF endpoint that is compatible with ASP.NET Web service clients in a configuration file  \n  \n1.  Create a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> binding configuration. For details, see the [How to: Specify a Service Binding in Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-specify-a-service-binding-in-configuration.md).  \n  \n2.  Optionally enable transport security for this service endpoint binding configuration by setting the security mode for the binding to <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurityMode>. For details, see [Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security.md).  \n  \n3.  Configure a new application endpoint for your service using the binding configuration that you just created. For details about how to add a service endpoint in a configuration file, see the [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-configuration.md).  \n  \n4.  Enable an HTTP/GET metadata endpoint for your service. For details see the [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example code demonstrates how to add a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] endpoint that is compatible with [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web service clients in code and alternatively in configuration files.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[C_HowTo-WCFServiceAndASMXClient#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto-wcfserviceandasmxclient/cs/program.cs#0)] \n
