Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,131],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Security Validation and Authentication Failures\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 0d4e3666-dfc6-421c-baf8-9479c22f7050","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[138,185],"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","linkify":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","nodes":[{"content":"Security Validation and Authentication Failures","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures","pos":[186,247]},{"pos":[256,267],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[271,415]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[416,438]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[448,493]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[503,570]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[580,659]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[669,757]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[767,801]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[811,920]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[930,983]}]}
