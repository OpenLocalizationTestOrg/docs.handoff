This is because saving the settings can take, depending on several factors, several seconds.  \n  \n For more information, see [My.Settings Object](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Although you can change and save the values of user-scope settings at run time, application-scope settings are read-only and cannot be changed programmatically. You can change application-scope settings when creating the application, through the **Project Designer**, or by editing the application's configuration file. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example changes the value of the `LastChanged` user setting and saves that change by calling the `My.Settings.Save` method.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyResources/VB/Form1.vb#5)]  \n  \n For this example to work, your application must have a `LastChanged` user setting, of type `Date`.
