{"content":"---\ntitle: .NET Core SDK telemetry\ndescription: Discover the .NET Core SDK telemetry features that collect usage information for analysis, which data is collected and how to disable it.\nauthor: richlander\nms.date: 06/20/2018\nms.custom: \"seodec18\"\n---\n# .NET Core SDK telemetry\n\nThe [.NET Core SDK](index.md) includes a [telemetry feature](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/master/src/dotnet/Telemetry) that collects usage information. It's important that the .NET Team understands how the tools are used so they can be improved. For more information, see [What we've learned from .NET Core SDK Telemetry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/what-weve-learned-from-net-core-sdk-telemetry/).\n\nThe collected data is anonymous and published in an aggregated form for use by both Microsoft and the community under the [Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe `dotnet` command is used to launch both apps and the .NET Core CLI. The `dotnet` command itself doesn't collect telemetry. The .NET Core CLI commands run by the `dotnet` command collect the telemetry.\n\nTelemetry *isn't enabled* when using the `dotnet` command itself, with no command attached:\n\n- `dotnet`\n- `dotnet [path-to-app]`\n\nTelemetry *is enabled* when using the [.NET Core CLI commands](index.md), such as:\n\n- `dotnet build`\n- `dotnet pack`\n- `dotnet restore`\n- `dotnet run`\n\n## How to opt out\n\nThe .NET Core SDK telemetry feature is enabled by default. Opt out of the telemetry feature by setting the `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.\n\n## Data points\n\nThe feature collects the following data:\n\n- Timestamp of invocation&#8224;\n- Command invoked (for example, \"build\")&#8224;\n- Three octet IP address used to determine geographical location&#8224;\n- `ExitCode` of the command\n- Test runner (for test projects)\n- Operating system and version&#8224;\n- Whether runtime IDs are present in the runtimes node\n- .NET Core SDK version&#8224;\n\n&#8224;This metric is published.\n\nStarting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK, new data points are collected:\n\n- `dotnet` command arguments and options: only known arguments and options are collected (not arbitrary strings).\n- Whether the SDK is running in a container.\n- Target frameworks.\n- Hashed MAC address: a cryptographically (SHA256) anonymous and unique ID for a machine. This metric isn't published.\n- Hashed current working directory.\n\nThe feature doesn't collect personal data, such as usernames or email addresses. It doesn't scan your code and doesn't extract sensitive project-level data, such as name, repo, or author. The data is sent securely to Microsoft servers using [Microsoft Azure Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/) technology, held under restricted access, and published under strict security controls from secure [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/) systems.\n\nThe .NET team wants to know how the tools are used and if they're working well, not what you're building with the tools. If you suspect that the telemetry is collecting sensitive data or that the data is being insecurely or inappropriately handled, file an issue in the [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) repository for investigation.\n\n## Published data\n\nPublished data is available quarterly and are listed at [.NET Core SDK Usage Data](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/cli-usage-data.md). The columns of a data file are:\n\n- Timestamp\n- Occurrences&#8224;\n- Command\n- Geography&#8225;\n- OSFamily\n- RuntimeID\n- OSVersion\n- SDKVersion\n\n&#8224;The *Occurrences* column displays the aggregate count of that command's use for that row's metrics that day.\n\n&#8225;Typically, the *Geography* column displays the name of a country. In some cases, the continent of Antarctica appears in this column, either due to researchers using .NET Core in Antarctica or incorrect location data.\n\n### Example\n\n| Timestamp      | Occurrences | Command | Geography | OSFamily | RuntimeID     | OSVersion | SDKVersion |\n| -------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- | ---------- |\n| 4/16/2017 0:00 | 8           | run     | Uganda    | Darwin   | osx.10.12-x64 | 10.12     | 1.0.1      |\n\n### Datasets\n\n[2016 - Q3](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2016-q3.tsv)  \n[2016 - Q4](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2016-q4.tsv)  \n[2017 - Q1](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2017-q1.tsv)  \n[2017 - Q2](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2017-q2.tsv)  \n[2017 - Q3](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2017-q3.tsv)  \n[2017 - Q4](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-2017-q4.tsv)  \n\nAdditional datasets are posted using a standard URL format. Replace `<YEAR>` with the year and replace `<QUARTER>` with the quarter of the year (use `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`). The files are in tab-separated values (*TSV*) format.\n\n`https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/usagedata/dotnet-cli-usage-<YEAR>-q<QUARTER>.tsv`\n\n## License\n\nThe Microsoft distribution of .NET Core is licensed with the [MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY EULA](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-eula).
