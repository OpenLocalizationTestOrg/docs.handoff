This example shows how to use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to log tracing information.  \n  \n For logging exception information, use the `My.Application.Log.WriteException` method; see [How to: Log Exceptions](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/how-to-log-exceptions.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example uses the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to write out the trace information.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyApplicationLog#11](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-log-messages_1.vb)]  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Make sure the data you write to the log does not include sensitive information such as user passwords.
