Historically, these objects have been referred to as controls. While the              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] SDK continues to use the term \"control\" to loosely mean any class that represents a visible object in an application, it is important to note that a class does not need to inherit from the              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class to have a visible presence. Classes that inherit from the              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class contain a              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, which allows the consumer of a control to radically change the control's appearance without having to create a new subclass.  This topic discusses how controls (both those that do inherit from the              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class and those that do not) are commonly used in              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].  \n  \n \n  \n<a name=\"creating_an_instance_of_a_control\"></a>   \n## Creating an Instance of a Control  \n You can add a control to an application by using either                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] or code.  The following example shows how to create a simple application that asks a user for their first and last name.  This example creates six controls: two labels, two text boxes, and two buttons, in                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. All controls can be created similarly.  \n  \n [!code-xml[ControlsOverview#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following example creates the same application in code. For brevity, the creation of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>,                  `grid1`, has been excluded from the sample.                   `grid1` has the same column and row definitions as shown in the preceding                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ControlsOverview#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[ControlsOverview#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/VisualBasic/AppInCode.xaml.vb#2)]  \n  \n<a name=\"changing_the_appearance_of_a_control\"></a>   \n## Changing the Appearance of a Control  \n It is common to change the appearance of a control to fit the look and feel of your application. You can change the appearance of a control by doing one of the following, depending on what you want to accomplish:  \n  \n-   Change the value of a property of the control.  \n  \n-   Create a                          <xref:System.Windows.Style> for the control.  \n  \n-   Create a new                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> for the control.  \n  \n### Changing a Control's Property Value  \n Many controls have properties that allow you to change how the control appears, such as the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>. You can set the value properties in both                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] and code. The following example sets the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A>,                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontSize%2A>, and                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.FontWeight%2A> properties on a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> in                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)].  \n  \n [!code-xml[ControlsOverview#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml#3)]  \n  \n The following example sets the same properties in code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ControlsOverview#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[ControlsOverview#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/VisualBasic/AppInCode.xaml.vb#4)]  \n  \n### Creating a Style for a Control  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] gives you the ability to specify the appearance of controls wholesale, instead of setting properties on each instance in the application, by creating a                          <xref:System.Windows.Style>.                           The following example                          creates a                          <xref:System.Windows.Style> that is applied to each                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> in the application.                          <xref:System.Windows.Style> definitions are typically defined in                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] in a                          <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>, such as the                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Resources%2A> property of the                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[ControlsOverview#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml#5)]  \n  \n You can also apply a style to only certain controls of a specific type by assigning a key to the style and specifying that key in the                          `Style` property of your control.  For more information about styles, see                          [Styling and Templating](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/styling-and-templating.md).  \n  \n### Creating a ControlTemplate  \n A                          <xref:System.Windows.Style> allows you to set properties on multiple controls at a time, but sometimes you might want to customize the appearance of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> beyond what you can do by creating a                          <xref:System.Windows.Style>. Classes that inherit from the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class have a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>, which defines the structure and appearance of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>. The                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Template%2A> property of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> is public, so you can give a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> that is different than its default. You can often specify a new                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> for a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> instead of inheriting from a control to customize the appearance of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control>.  \n  \n Consider the very common control,                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  The primary behavior of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is to enable an application to take some action when the user clicks it.  By default, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> in                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] appears as a raised rectangle.  While developing an application, you might want to take advantage of the behavior of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>--that is, by handling the button's click event--but you might change the button's appearance beyond what you can do by changing the button's properties.  In this case, you can create a new                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate>.  \n  \n The following example creates a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> for a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  The                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> creates a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> with rounded corners and a gradient background.  The                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> contains a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> whose                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border.Background%2A> is a                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.LinearGradientBrush> with two                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.GradientStop> objects.  The first                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.GradientStop> uses data binding to bind the                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.GradientStop.Color%2A> property of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.GradientStop> to the color of the button's background.  When you set the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>, the color of that value will be used as the first                          <xref:System.Windows.Media.GradientStop>. For more information about data binding, see                          [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md). The example also creates a                          <xref:System.Windows.Trigger> that changes the appearance of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> when                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.IsPressed%2A> is                          `true`.  \n  \n [!code-xml[ControlsOverview#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/Window1.xaml#6)]  \n[!code-xml[ControlsOverview#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml#7)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property of the                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> must be set to a                              <xref:System.Windows.Media.SolidColorBrush> for the example to work properly.  \n  \n<a name=\"subscribing_to_events\"></a>   \n## Subscribing to Events  \n You can subscribe to a control's event by using either                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] or code, but you can only handle an event in code.  The following example shows how to subscribe to the                  `Click` event of a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[ControlsOverview#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/Window1.xaml#10)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ControlsOverview#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[ControlsOverview#8](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/VisualBasic/AppInCode.xaml.vb#8)]  \n  \n The following example handles the                  `Click` event of a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ControlsOverview#9](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/CSharp/AppInCode.xaml.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[ControlsOverview#9](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ControlsOverview/VisualBasic/AppInCode.xaml.vb#9)]  \n  \n<a name=\"rich_content_in_controls\"></a>   \n## Rich Content in Controls  \n Most classes that inherit from the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control> class have the capacity to contain rich content. For example, a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> can contain any object, such as a string, an                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image>, or a                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>.  The following classes provide support for rich content and act as base classes for most of the controls in
