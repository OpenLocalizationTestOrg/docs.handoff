An example of an aggregation operation is calculating the average daily temperature from a month's worth of daily temperature values.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the results of two different aggregation operations on a sequence of numbers. The first operation sums the numbers. The second operation returns the maximum value in the sequence.  \n  \n ![LINQ Aggregation Operations](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/media/linq_aggregation.png \"LINQ_Aggregation\")  \n  \n The standard query operator methods that perform aggregation operations are listed in the following section.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method Name|Description|Visual

Average  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into Average` clause in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] to calculate the average temperature in an array of numbers that represent temperatures.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#1](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_1.vb)]  \n  \n### Count  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into Count` clause in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] to count the number of values in an array that are greater than or equal to 80.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#2](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_2.vb)]  \n  \n### LongCount  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into LongCount` clause to count the number of values in an array.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#3](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_3.vb)]  \n  \n### Max  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into Max` clause  to calculate the maximum temperature in an array of numbers that represent temperatures.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#4](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_4.vb)]  \n  \n### Min  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into Min` clause  to calculate the minimum temperature in an array of numbers that represent temperatures.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#5](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_5.vb)]  \n  \n### Sum  \n The following code example uses the `Aggregate Into Sum` clause  to calculate the total expense amount from an array of values that represent expenses.  \n  \n [!code-vb[CsLINQAggregating#6](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/codesnippet/VisualBasic/aggregation-operations_6.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Linq>   \n [Standard
