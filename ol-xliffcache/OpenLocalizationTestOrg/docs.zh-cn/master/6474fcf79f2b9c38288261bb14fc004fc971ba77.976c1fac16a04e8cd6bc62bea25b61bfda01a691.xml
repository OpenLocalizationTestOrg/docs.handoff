In some situations, such as when an application retrieves data or displays content, a full garbage collection can occur at a critical time and impede performance. You can adjust the intrusiveness of the garbage collector by setting the <xref:System.Runtime.GCSettings.LatencyMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to one of the <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode?displayProperty=fullName> values.  \n  \n Latency refers to the time that the garbage collector intrudes in your application. During low latency periods, the garbage collector is more conservative and less intrusive in reclaiming objects. The <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration provides two low latency settings:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode> suppresses generation 2 collections and performs only generation 0 and 1 collections. It can be used only for short periods of time. Over longer periods, if the system is under memory pressure, the garbage collector will trigger a collection, which can briefly pause the application and disrupt a time-critical operation. This setting is available only for workstation garbage collection.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode> suppresses foreground generation 2 collections and performs only generation 0, 1, and background generation 2 collections. It can be used for longer periods of time, and is available for both workstation and server garbage collection. This setting cannot be used if [concurrent garbage collection](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcconcurrent-element.md) is disabled.  \n  \n During low latency periods, generation 2 collections are suppressed unless the following occurs:  \n  \n-   The system receives a low memory notification from the operating system.  \n  \n-   Your application code induces a collection by calling the <xref:System.GC.Collect%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and specifying 2 for the `generation` parameter.  \n  \n The following table lists the application scenarios for using the <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode> values.  \n  \n|Latency mode|Application scenarios|  \n|------------------|---------------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode>|For applications that have no UI or server-side operations.<br /><br /> This is the default mode when [concurrent garbage collection](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcconcurrent-element.md) is disabled.|  \n|<xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode>|For most applications that have a UI.<br /><br /> This is the default mode when [concurrent garbage collection](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/gcconcurrent-element.md) is enabled.|  \n|<xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode>|For applications that have short-term, time-sensitive operations during which interruptions from the garbage collector could be disruptive.

For example, applications that need quick response times as market data changes during trading hours.<br /><br /> This mode results in a larger managed heap size than other modes. Because it does not compact the managed heap, higher fragmentation is possible. Ensure that sufficient memory is available.|  \n  \n## Guidelines for Using Low Latency  \n When you use <xref:System.Runtime.GCLatencyMode> mode, consider the following guidelines:  \n  \n-   Keep the period of time in low latency as short as possible.  \n  \n-   Avoid allocating high amounts of memory during low latency periods. Low memory notifications can occur because garbage collection reclaims fewer objects.  \n  \n-   While in the low latency mode, minimize the number of allocations you make, in particular allocations onto the Large Object Heap and pinned objects.  \n  \n-   Be aware of threads that could be allocating. Because the <xref:System.Runtime.GCSettings.LatencyMode%2A> property setting is process-wide, you could generate an <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException> on any thread that may be allocating.  \n  \n-   Wrap the low latency code in constrained execution regions (for more information, see [Constrained Execution Regions](../../../docs/framework/performance/constrained-execution-regions.md)).  \n  \n-   You can force generation 2 collections during a low latency period by calling the <xref:System.GC.Collect%28System.Int32%2CSystem.GCCollectionMode%29?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n## See
