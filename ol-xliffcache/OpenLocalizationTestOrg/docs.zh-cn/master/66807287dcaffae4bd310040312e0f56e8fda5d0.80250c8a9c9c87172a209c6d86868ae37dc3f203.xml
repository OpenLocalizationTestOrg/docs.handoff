Selecting rows in the master table causes the detail table to update with the corresponding child data.  \n  \n Implementing a master/detail form is easy using the interaction between the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. In this walkthrough, you will build the form using two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> controls and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components. The form will show two related tables in the Northwind SQL Server sample database: `Customers` and `Orders`. When you are finished, you will have a form that shows all the customers in the database in the master <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> and all the orders for the selected customer in the detail <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>.  \n  \n To copy the code in this topic as a single listing, see [How to: Create a Master/Detail Form Using Two Windows Forms DataGridView Controls](create-a-master-detail-form-using-two-datagridviews.md).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n In order to complete this walkthrough, you will need:  \n  \n-   Access to a server that has the Northwind SQL Server sample database.  \n  \n## Creating the form  \n  \n#### To create a master/detail form  \n  \n1.  Create a class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> and contains two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> controls and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components. The following code provides basic form initialization and includes a `Main` method. If you use the Visual Studio designer to create your form, you can use the designer generated code instead of this code, but be sure to use the names shown in the variable declarations here.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#01](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/CS/masterdetails.cs#01)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#01](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/VB/masterdetails.vb#01)]  \n    [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#02](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/CS/masterdetails.cs#02)]\n    [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#02](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/VB/masterdetails.vb#02)]  \n  \n2.  Implement a method in your form's class definition for handling the detail of connecting to the database. This example uses a `GetData` method that populates a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object, adds a <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> object to the data set, and binds the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components. Be sure to set the `connectionString` variable to a value that is appropriate for your database.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#20](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/CS/masterdetails.cs#20)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#20](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/VB/masterdetails.vb#20)]  \n  \n3.  Implement a handler for your form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event that binds the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> controls to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> components and calls the `GetData` method. The following example includes code that resizes <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> columns to fit the displayed data.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#10](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/CS/masterdetails.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails#10](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMasterDetails/VB/masterdetails.vb#10)]  \n  \n## Testing the Application  \n You can now test the form to make sure it behaves as expected.  \n  \n#### To test the form  \n  \n-   Compile and run the application.  \n  \n     You will see two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> controls, one above the other. On top are the customers from the Northwind `Customers` table, and at the bottom are the `Orders` corresponding to the selected customer. As you select different rows in the upper <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>, the contents of the lower <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> change accordingly.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n This application gives you a basic understanding of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's capabilities. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control in several ways:  \n  \n-   Change border and header styles. For more information, see [How to: Change the Border and Gridline Styles in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](change-the-border-and-gridline-styles-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n-   Enable or restrict user input to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For more information, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-datagridview.md), and [How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-make-columns-read-only-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Validate user input to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Validating Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](walkthrough-validating-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Handle very large data sets using virtual mode. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Virtual Mode in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](implementing-virtual-mode-wf-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n-   Customize the appearance of cells. For more information, see [How to: Customize the Appearance of Cells in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](customize-the-appearance-of-cells-in-the-datagrid.md) and [How to: Set Default Cell Styles for the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-set-default-cell-styles-for-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n-
