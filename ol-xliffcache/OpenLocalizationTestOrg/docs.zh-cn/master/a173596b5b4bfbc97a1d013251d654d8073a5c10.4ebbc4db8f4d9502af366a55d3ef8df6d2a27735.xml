Application\nThis section contains various topics that describe how you can use tracing to troubleshoot your application.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Recommended Settings for Tracing and Message Logging](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/recommended-settings-for-tracing-and-message-logging.md)  \n Describes suggested settings for production and debugging environments.  \n  \n [Using Service Trace Viewer for Viewing Correlated Traces and Troubleshooting](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-service-trace-viewer-for-viewing-correlated-traces-and-troubleshooting.md)  \n Describes how you can use the Service Trace Viewer tool to view, correlate and analyze trace data.  \n  \n [Significant Traces](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/significant-traces.md)  \n A list of major traces emitted by WCF.  \n  \n [Debugging on the Client](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/debugging-on-the-client.md)  \n Enables clients to debug your application.  \n  \n [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md)  \n Describes traces used for E2E WCF scenarios, for example, synchronous wsHttp request-replies, and asynchronous TCP one-way requests.  \n  \n [Emitting User-Code Traces](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/emitting-user-code-traces.md)  \n Describes how to emit traces programmatically in user code, so that you can proactively create instrumentation data to be used later for diagnostic purpose, and in correlation with WCF traces.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Service Trace Viewer Tool (SvcTraceViewer.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/service-trace-viewer-tool-svctraceviewer-exe.md)\n-
