Since the compiler will be unable to choose, this error will be generated. To resolve, write a new explicit method converting A to B.  \n  \n Another scenario that causes this error is if there are two methods that convert A to B. To fix, specify which conversion to use through an explicit cast.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0457.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0457.cs  \nusing System;  \npublic class A { }  \n  \npublic class G0 {  }  \npublic class G1<R> : G0 {  }  \n  \npublic class H0 {  \n   public static implicit operator G0(H0 h) {  \n      return new G0();  \n   }  \n}  \npublic class H1<R> : H0 {  \n   public static implicit operator G1<R>(H1<R> h) {  \n      return new G1<R>();  \n   }  \n}  \n  \npublic class Test   \n{  \n   public static void F0(G0 g) {  }  \n   public static void Main()   \n   {  \n      H1<A> h1a = new H1<A>();  \n      F0(h1a);   // CS0457  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0457 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0457 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[566,587],"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0457","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0457","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ambiguous user defined conversions 'Conversion method name 1' and 'Conversion method name 2' when converting from 'type name 1' to 'type name 2'","pos":[588,732]},{"content":"Two conversion methods are applicable, and the compiler is unable to decide which one to use.","pos":[739,832]},{"content":"One scenario that can cause this error is as follows:","pos":[839,892]},{"content":"You want to convert class A to class B where A and B are unrelated.","pos":[902,969]},{"content":"A is derived from A0, and there is a method that converts from A0 to B.","pos":[979,1050]},{"content":"B has a subclass B1 and there is a method that converts from A to B1.","pos":[1060,1129]},{"content":"The compiler will weight the two conversion methods equally, because the first conversion provides the best destination type, and the second conversion provides the best source type.","pos":[1136,1318]},{"content":"Since the compiler will be unable to choose, this error will be generated.","pos":[1319,1393]},{"content":"To resolve, write a new explicit method converting A to B.","pos":[1394,1452]},{"content":"Another scenario that causes this error is if there are two methods that convert A to B.
