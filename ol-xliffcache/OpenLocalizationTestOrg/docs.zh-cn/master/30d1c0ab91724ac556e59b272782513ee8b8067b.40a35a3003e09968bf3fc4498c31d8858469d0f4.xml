You can use a variable anywhere you can use a constant or a literal, except in an expression that defines the value of a constant.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Use the variable name following the equal (`=`) sign in an assignment statement.  \n  \n     The following example reads the value of the variable `startValue` and then uses the value of the variable `counter` in an expression.  \n  \n    ```  \n    counter = startValue  \n    cellValue = (counter + 5) ^ 2  \n    ```  \n  \n     The value of the variable participates in the expression just as a constant would, and then it is stored in the variable or property on the left side of the assignment statement.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/index.md)\n- [Variable Declaration](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/variable-declaration.md)\n- [Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,258],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Move Data Into and Out of a Variable (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
