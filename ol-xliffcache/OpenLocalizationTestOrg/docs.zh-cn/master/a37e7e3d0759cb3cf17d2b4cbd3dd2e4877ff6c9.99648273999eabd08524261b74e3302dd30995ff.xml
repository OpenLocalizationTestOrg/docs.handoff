If a particular comparison is not valid for [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)], an exception will be thrown. All comparisons, both implicit and explicit, require that all components are comparable in the data source. Comparison expressions are frequently used in `Where` clauses for restricting the query results.  \n  \n The following example in query expression syntax shows a query that returns results where the sales order number is equal to \"SO43663\":  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#RestrictionExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#restrictionexpression)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#RestrictionExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#restrictionexpression)]  \n  \n The following example in method-based query syntax shows a query that returns results where the sales order number is equal to \"SO43663\":  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#RestrictionExpression_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#restrictionexpression_mq)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#RestrictionExpression_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#restrictionexpression_mq)]  \n  \n The following example in query expression syntax shows a query that returns sales order information where the ship date is equal to July 8, 2001:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#DateTimeComparison](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#datetimecomparison)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#DateTimeComparison](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#datetimecomparison)]  \n  \n The following example in method-based query syntax shows a query that returns sales order information where the ship date is equal to July 8, 2001:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#DateTimeComparison_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#datetimecomparison_mq)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#DateTimeComparison_MQ](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#datetimecomparison_mq)]  \n  \n Expressions that yield a constant are converted at the server, and no attempt to do local evaluation is performed.
