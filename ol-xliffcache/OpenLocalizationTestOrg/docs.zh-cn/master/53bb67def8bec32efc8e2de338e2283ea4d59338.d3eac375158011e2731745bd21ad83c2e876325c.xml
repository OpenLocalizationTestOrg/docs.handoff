Each party generates a public/private key pair.  \n  \n2.  The parties exchange their public keys.  \n  \n3.  Each party generates a secret key for TripleDES encryption, for example, and encrypts the newly created key using the other's public key.  \n  \n4.  Each party sends the data to the other and combines the other's secret key with its own, in a particular order, to create a new secret key.  \n  \n5.  The parties then initiate a conversation using symmetric encryption.  \n  \n Creating a cryptographic scheme is not a trivial task.
