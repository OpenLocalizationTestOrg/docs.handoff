Auto-implemented properties can be initialized by using assignment or a `New` clause, but expanded properties cannot be.  \n  \n```vb  \nClass AutoImplementedExample  \n    ' An auto-implemented property can be assigned an initial value.  \n    Property IDNum As Integer = 33542  \n    ' An auto-implemented property can be initialized with New.  \n    Property Name As New String(\"Don Hall\")  \nEnd Class  \n  \nClass ExpandedExample  \n    ' Attempting to expand an initialized auto-implemented property  \n    ' causes this error.  \n    'Property IDNum As Integer = 33542  \n    '    Get  \n    '    End Get  \n    '    Set(ByVal value As Integer)  \n    '    End Set  \n    'End Property  \n  \n    ' Instead, you can assign the initial value to the backing field.  \n    Private _IDNum As Integer = 33542  \n    Property IDNum As Integer  \n        Get  \n        End Get  \n        Set(ByVal value As Integer)  \n        End Set  \n    End Property  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/auto-implemented-properties.md)\n- [How to: Create a Property](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-create-a-property.md)\n- [Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,202],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Expanded properties cannot be initialized\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36714\"\n  - \"bc36714\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36714\"\nms.assetid: ba9408f3-e606-4749-8372-987999f405f5","nodes":[{"content":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","nodes":[{"content":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[209,250],"content":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","linkify":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","nodes":[{"content":"Expanded properties cannot be initialized","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"An auto-implemented property can be initialized as part of its declaration, but an expanded property cannot be.","pos":[251,362]},{"pos":[369,390],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36714","source":"**Error ID:** BC36714"},{"pos":[399,420],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Either use an auto-implemented property or remove the initialization from the property declaration.","pos":[430,529]},{"pos":[538,545],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following examples show both auto-implemented and expanded properties.","pos":[549,623]},{"content":"Auto-implemented properties can be initialized by using assignment or a <ph id=\"ph1\">`New`</ph> clause, but expanded properties cannot be.","pos":[624,744],"source":" Auto-implemented properties can be initialized by using assignment or a `New` clause, but expanded properties cannot be."},{"pos":[1579,1587],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1591,1718],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Auto-Implemented Properties<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/auto-implemented-properties.md)</ept>","source":"[Auto-Implemented Properties](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/auto-implemented-properties.md)"},{"pos":[1721,1843],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Property<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-create-a-property.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Create a Property](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-create-a-property.md)"},{"pos":[1846,1957],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)"}]}
