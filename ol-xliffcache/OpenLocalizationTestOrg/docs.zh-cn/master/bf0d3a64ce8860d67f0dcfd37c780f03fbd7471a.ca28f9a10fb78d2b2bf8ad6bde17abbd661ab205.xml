By using image encoders in [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can write images from memory to disk. By using image decoders in [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can load images from disk into memory. An encoder translates the data in an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> or <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object into a designated disk file format. A decoder translates the data in a disk file to the format required by the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> and <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> objects.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] has built-in encoders and decoders that support the following file types:  \n  \n-   BMP  \n  \n-   GIF  \n  \n-   JPEG  \n  \n-   PNG  \n  \n-   TIFF  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] also has built-in decoders that support the following file types:  \n  \n-   WMF  \n  \n-   EMF  \n  \n-   ICON  \n  \n The following topics discuss encoders and decoders in more detail:  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: List Installed Encoders](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)  \n Describes how
