Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  \n  \n Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33026  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,225],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc33026\"\n  - \"vbc33026\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33026\"\nms.assetid: 3533cf71-6a52-4fd0-a1f2-127c4ecd56ae","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[232,296],"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","linkify":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert from a type to its base type","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"A conversion operator is declared with a return type from which the parameter type derives.","pos":[297,388]},{"content":"At compile time, Visual Basic considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any type in its inheritance hierarchy, that is, any type from which it derives or which derives from it.","pos":[395,599]},{"content":"Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.","pos":[600,736]},{"content":"Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.","pos":[743,850]},{"pos":[857,878],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33026","source":"**Error ID:** BC33026"},{"pos":[887,908],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove this operator definition entirely.","pos":[918,959]},{"content":"It is already predefined.","pos":[960,985]},{"pos":[994,1002],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1006,1117],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[1120,1212],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1215,1339],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define an Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1342,1486],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define a Conversion Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)"}]}
