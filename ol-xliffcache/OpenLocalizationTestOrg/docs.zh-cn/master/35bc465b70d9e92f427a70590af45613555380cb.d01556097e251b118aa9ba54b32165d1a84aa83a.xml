Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a specified page range, or print a selection. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PrintDialog Component Overview](printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintDialog` component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings.  \n  \n [How to: Display the PrintDialog Component](how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)  \n Explains how to display the dialog and where it saves properties.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,420],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"print options [Windows Forms], PrintDialog component (using designer)\"\n  - \"PrintDialog component [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"Print dialog box (using designer)\"\n  - \"printing [Windows Forms], PrintDialog component (using designer)\"\n  - \"printing [Windows Forms], print options\"\nms.assetid: 09b54db1-d7c7-42fa-b98a-840e6b80a9ad","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[427,464],"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintDialog`</ph> component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications.","pos":[465,664],"source":"The Windows Forms `PrintDialog` component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications."},{"content":"Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[665,785]},{"content":"You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a specified page range, or print a selection.","pos":[786,909]},{"content":"By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.","pos":[910,1038]},{"pos":[1047,1062],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintDialog Component Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1066,1147],"source":"[PrintDialog Component Overview](printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Introduces the general concepts of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintDialog`</ph> component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings.","pos":[1151,1371],"source":"Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintDialog` component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Display the PrintDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)</ept>","pos":[1378,1466],"source":"[How to: Display the PrintDialog Component](how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to display the dialog and where it saves properties.","pos":[1470,1535]},{"pos":[1544,1553],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Provides reference information on the class and its members.","pos":[1600,1660]},{"pos":[1669,1685],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1689,1760],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1764,1855]}]}
