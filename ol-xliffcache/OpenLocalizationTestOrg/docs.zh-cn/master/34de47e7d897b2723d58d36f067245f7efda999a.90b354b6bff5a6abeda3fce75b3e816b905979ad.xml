[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] works by accessing the individual vertical color stripe elements in every pixel of an LCD screen. Before [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)], the smallest level of detail that a computer could display was a single pixel, but with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] running on an LCD monitor, we can now display features of text as small as a fraction of a pixel in width. The extra resolution increases the sharpness of the tiny details in text display, making it much easier to read over long durations.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] available in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] is the latest generation of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] which has several improvements over version found in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_gdi](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-gdi-md.md)].  \n  \n<a name=\"sub-pixel_positioning\"></a>   \n## Sub-pixel Positioning  \n A significant improvement over the previous version of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] is the use of sub-pixel positioning. Unlike the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] implementation found in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_gdi](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-gdi-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] found in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] allows glyphs to start within the pixel and not just the beginning boundary of the pixel. Because of this extra resolution in positioning glyphs, the spacing and proportions of the glyphs is more precise and consistent.  \n  \n The following two examples show how glyphs may begin on any sub-pixel boundary when sub-pixel positioning is used. The example on the left is rendered using the earlier version of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] renderer, which did not employ sub-pixel positioning. The example on the right is rendered using the new version of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] renderer, using sub-pixel positioning. Note how each **e** and **l** in the right-hand image is rendered slightly differently because each starts on a different sub-pixel. When viewing the text at its normal size on the screen, this difference is not noticeable because of the high contrast of the glyph image. This is only possible because of sophisticated color filtering that is incorporated in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)].  \n  \n ![Text displayed with two versions of ClearType](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/wcpsdk-mmgraphics-text-cleartype-overview-01.png \"wcpsdk_mmgraphics_text_cleartype_overview_01\")  \nText displayed with earlier and later versions of ClearType  \n  \n The following two examples compare output from the earlier [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] renderer with the new version of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] renderer. The subpixel positioning, shown on the right, greatly improves the spacing of type on screen, especially at small sizes where the difference between a sub-pixel and a whole pixel represents a significant proportion of glyph width. Note that spacing between the letters is more even in the second image. The cumulative benefit of sub-pixel positioning to the overall appearance of a screen of text is greatly increased, and represents a significant evolution in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] technology.  \n  \n ![Text displayed with earlier version of ClearType](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/wcpsdk-mmgraphics-text-cleartype-overview-02.png \"wcpsdk_mmgraphics_text_cleartype_overview_02\")  \nText with earlier and later versions of ClearType  \n  \n<a name=\"y-direction_antialiasing\"></a>   \n## Y-Direction Antialiasing  \n Another improvement of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] is y-direction anti-aliasing. The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_gdi](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-gdi-md.md)] without y-direction anti-aliasing provides better resolution on the x-axis but not the y-axis. On the tops and bottoms of shallow curves, the jagged edges detract from its readability.  \n  \n The following example shows the effect of having no y-direction antialiasing. In this case, the jagged edges on the top and bottom of the letter are apparent.  \n  \n ![Text with jagged edges on shallow curves](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/wcpsdk-mmgraphics-text-cleartype-overview-03.png \"wcpsdk_mmgraphics_text_cleartype_overview_03\")  \nText with jagged edges on shallow curves  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides antialiasing on the y-direction level to smooth out any jagged edges. This is particularly important for improving the readability of East Asian languages where ideographs have an almost equal amount of horizontal and vertical shallow curves.  \n  \n The following example shows the effect of y-direction antialiasing. In this case, the top and bottom of the letter show a smooth curve.  \n  \n ![Text with ClearType y&#45;direction anti&#45;aliasing](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/wcpsdk-mmgraphics-text-cleartype-overview-04.png \"wcpsdk_mmgraphics_text_cleartype_overview_04\")  \nText with ClearType y-direction antialiasing  \n  \n<a name=\"hardware_acceleration\"></a>   \n## Hardware Acceleration  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] can take advantage of hardware acceleration for better performance and to reduce CPU load and system memory requirements. By using the pixel shaders and video memory of a graphics card, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] provides faster rendering of text, particularly when animation is used.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] does not modify the system-wide [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] settings. Disabling [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mswin-md.md)] sets [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] antialiasing to grayscale mode. In addition, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ct](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ct-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] does not modify the settings of the [ClearType Tuner PowerToy](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypePowerToy.mspx).  \n  \n One of the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] architectural design decisions is to have resolution independent layout better support higher resolution DPI monitors, which are becoming more widespread. This has the consequence of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] not supporting aliased text rendering or the bitmaps in some East Asian fonts because they are both resolution dependent.  \n  \n<a name=\"further_information\"></a>   \n## Further Information  \n [ClearType Information](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearTypeInfo.mspx)  \n  \n
