They do this by providing collections of *default instances* of each of these objects.  \n  \n## Default Instances  \n A default instance is an instance of the class that is provided by the runtime and does not need to be declared and instantiated using the `Dim` and `New` statements. The following example demonstrates how you might have declared and instantiated an instance of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class called `Form1`, and how you are now able to get a default instance of this <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class through `My.Forms`.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMy/VB/Class1.vb#5)]  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMy/VB/Class1.vb#6)]  \n  \n The `My.Forms` object returns a collection of default instances for every `Form` class that exists in your project. Similarly, `My.WebServices` provides a default instance of the proxy class for every Web service that you have created a reference to in your application.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [My.Forms Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-forms-object.md)\n- [My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)\n- [How My Depends on Project Type](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/how-my-depends-on-project-type.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,423],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Default Object Instances Provided by My.Forms and My.WebServices (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
