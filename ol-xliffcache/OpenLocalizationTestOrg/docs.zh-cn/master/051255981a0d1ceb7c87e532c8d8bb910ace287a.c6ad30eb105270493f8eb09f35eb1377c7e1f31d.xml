The former itemizes the capabilities of a print device and the latter specifies how the device should use those capabilities with respect to a particular sequence of documents, individual document, or individual page.  \n  \n A typical sequence of tasks for an application that supports printing would be as follows.  \n  \n1.  Determine a printer's capabilities.  \n  \n2.  Configure a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> to use those capabilities.  \n  \n3.  Validate the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>.  \n  \n This article shows how to do this.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the simple example below, we are interested only in whether a printer can support duplexing — two-sided printing. The major steps are as follows.  \n  \n1.  Get a <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> object with the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.GetPrintCapabilities%2A> method.  \n  \n2.  Test for the presence of the capability you want. In the example below, we test the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.DuplexingCapability%2A> property of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities> object for the presence of the capability of printing on both sides of a sheet of paper with the \"page turning\" along the long side of the sheet. Since <xref:System.Printing.PrintCapabilities.DuplexingCapability%2A> is a collection, we use the `Contains` method of <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ReadOnlyCollection%601>.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This step is not strictly necessary. The <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.MergeAndValidatePrintTicket%2A> method used below will check each request in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> against the capabilities of the printer. If the requested capability is not supported by printer, the printer driver will substitute an alternative request in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> returned by the method.  \n  \n3.  If the printer supports duplexing, the sample code creates a <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> that asks for duplexing. But the application does not specify every possible printer setting available in the <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> element. That would be wasteful of both programmer and program time. Instead, the code sets only the duplexing request and then merges this <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> with an existing, fully configured and validated, <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>, in this case, the user's default <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>.  \n  \n4.  Accordingly, the sample calls the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.MergeAndValidatePrintTicket%2A> method to merge the new, minimal, <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> with the user's default <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket>. This returns a <xref:System.Printing.ValidationResult> that includes the new <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> as one of its properties.  \n  \n5.  The sample then tests that the new <xref:System.Printing.PrintTicket> requests duplexing. If it does, then the sample makes it the new default print ticket for the user. If step 2 above had been left out and the printer did not support duplexing along the long side, then the test would have resulted in `false`. (See the note above.)  \n  \n6.  The last significant step is to commit the change to the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.UserPrintTicket%2A> property of the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue> with the <xref:System.Printing.PrintQueue.Commit%2A> method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PrintTicketManagment#UsingMergeAndValidate](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PrintTicketManagment/CSharp/printticket.cs#usingmergeandvalidate)]\n [!code-vb[PrintTicketManagment#UsingMergeAndValidate](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PrintTicketManagment/visualbasic/printticket.vb#usingmergeandvalidate)]  \n  \n So that you can quickly test this example, the remainder of it is presented below.
