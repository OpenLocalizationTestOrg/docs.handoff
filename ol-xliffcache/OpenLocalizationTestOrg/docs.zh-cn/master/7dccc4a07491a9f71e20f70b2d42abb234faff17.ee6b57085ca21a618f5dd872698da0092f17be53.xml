Services run in the context of the default system account, called `LocalSystem`, which gives them different access privileges to system resources than the user. You can change this behavior to specify a different user account under which your service should run.  \n  \n You set the security context by manipulating the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller.Account%2A> property for the process within which the service runs. This property allows you to set the service to one of four account types:  \n  \n-   `User`, which causes the system to prompt for a valid user name and password when the service is installed and runs in the context of an account specified by a single user on the network;  \n  \n-   `LocalService`, which runs in the context of an account that acts as a non-privileged user on the local computer, and presents anonymous credentials to any remote server;  \n  \n-   `LocalSystem`, which runs in the context of an account that provides extensive local privileges, and presents the computer's credentials to any remote server;  \n  \n-   `NetworkService`, which runs in the context of an account that acts as a non-privileged user on the local computer, and presents the computer's credentials to any remote server.  \n  \n For more information, see the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceAccount> enumeration.  \n  \n### To specify the security context for a service  \n  \n1.  After creating your service, add the necessary installers for it. For more information, see [How to: Add Installers to Your Service Application](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-add-installers-to-your-service-application.md).  \n  \n2.  In the designer, access the `ProjectInstaller` class and click the service process installer for the service you are working with.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  For every service application, there are at least two installation components in the `ProjectInstaller` class — one that installs the processes for all services in the project, and one installer for each service the application contains. In this instance, you want to select <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller>.  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller.Account%2A> to the appropriate value.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to Windows Service
