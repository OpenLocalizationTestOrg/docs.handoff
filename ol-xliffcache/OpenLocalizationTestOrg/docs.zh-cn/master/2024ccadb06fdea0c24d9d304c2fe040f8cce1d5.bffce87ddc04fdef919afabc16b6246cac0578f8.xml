This path is not verified until it is loaded. Enclose the directory name in quotation marks (\" \") if it contains a space.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n This option tells the Visual Basic compiler to load the mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll files from a non-default location. The `-sdkpath` option was designed to be used with [-netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md). The [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)] uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-sdkpath` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line. The `-sdkpath` option is set when a Visual Basic device project is loaded.  \n  \n You can specify that the compiler should compile without a reference to the Visual Basic Runtime Library by using the `-vbruntime` compiler option. For more information, see [-vbruntime](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/vbruntime.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `Myfile.vb` with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)], using the versions of Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll found in the default installation directory of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)] on the C drive. Typically, you would use the most recent version of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)].  \n  \n```console\nvbc -netcf -sdkpath:\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\\CompactFrameworkSDK\\v1.0.5000\\Windows CE \" myfile.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)\n- [-netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)\n- [-vbruntime](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/vbruntime.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,292],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-sdkpath\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"sdkpath\"\n  - \"-sdkpath\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"-sdkpath compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/sdkpath compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"sdkpath compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: fec8a3f1-b791-4a37-8af7-344859f8212d","nodes":[{"content":"-sdkpath","nodes":[{"pos":[0,8],"content":"-sdkpath","nodes":[{"content":"-sdkpath","pos":[0,8]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[299,307],"content":"-sdkpath","linkify":"-sdkpath","nodes":[{"content":"-sdkpath","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Specifies the location of mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.","pos":[308,377]},{"pos":[386,392],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[432,441],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"The directory containing the versions of mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll to use for compilation.","pos":[455,562]},{"content":"This path is not verified until it is loaded.","pos":[563,608]},{"content":"Enclose the directory name in quotation marks (\" \") if it contains a space.","pos":[609,684]},{"pos":[693,700],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This option tells the Visual Basic compiler to load the mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll files from a non-default location.","pos":[704,837]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-sdkpath`</ph> option was designed to be used with <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>-netcf<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)</ept>.","pos":[838,962],"source":" The `-sdkpath` option was designed to be used with [-netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)]</ph> uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices.","pos":[963,1137],"source":" The [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)] uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices."},{"pos":[1145,1383],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `-sdkpath` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.
