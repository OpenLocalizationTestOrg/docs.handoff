For more information about EdmGen.exe commands, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md).  \n  \n If you use EdmGen.exe to generate the model and mapping files, you still need to configure your Visual Studio project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A conceptual model generated by EdmGen.exe includes all the objects in the database. If you want to generate a conceptual model that includes only specific objects, use the Entity Data Model Wizard. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n### To generate the School model for a Visual Basic project using EdmGen.exe  \n  \n1.  Create the School database. For more information, see [Creating the School Sample Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399731(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n2.  At the command prompt, execute the following command without line breaks:  \n  \n    ```  \n    \"%windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\edmgen.exe\" /mode:fullgeneration   \n    /c:\"Data Source=%datasourceserver%; Initial Catalog=School; Integrated Security=SSPI\"   \n    /project:School /entitycontainer:SchoolEntities /namespace:SchoolModel /language:VB  \n    ```  \n  \n### To generate the School model for a C# project using EdmGen.exe  \n  \n1.
