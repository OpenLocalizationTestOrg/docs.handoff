For more information about access keys, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md).  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"accept\" button of the form, pressing ENTER chooses the button, even if another control has the focus — except if that other control is another button, a multi-line text box, or a custom control that traps the enter key.  \n  \n-   If the button is the \"cancel\" button of the form, pressing ESC chooses the button, even if another control has the focus.  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A> method to select the button programmatically.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Button Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)   \n [Button Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,74],"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[482,527],"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","linkify":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","nodes":[{"content":"Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"A Windows Forms button can be selected in the following ways:","pos":[528,589]},{"content":"Use a mouse to click the button.","pos":[599,631]},{"content":"Invoke the button's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click&gt;</ph> event in code.","pos":[641,717],"source":"Invoke the button's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event in code."},{"content":"Move the focus to the button by pressing the TAB key, and then choose the button by pressing the SPACEBAR or ENTER.","pos":[727,842]},{"content":"Press the access key (ALT + the underlined letter) for the button.","pos":[852,918]},{"content":"For more information about access keys, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md)</ept>.","pos":[919,1121],"source":" For more information about access keys, see [How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-for-windows-forms-controls.md)."},{"content":"If the button is the \"accept\" button of the form, pressing ENTER chooses the button, even if another control has the focus — except if that other control is another button, a multi-line text box, or a custom control that traps the enter key.","pos":[1131,1372]},{"content":"If the button is the \"cancel\" button of the form, pressing ESC chooses the button, even if another control has the focus.","pos":[1382,1503]},{"content":"Call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A&gt;</ph> method to select the button programmatically.","pos":[1513,1618],"source":"Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button.PerformClick%2A> method to select the button programmatically."},{"pos":[1627,1635],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Button Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1639,1752],"source":"[Button Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-overview-windows-forms.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1755,1900],"source":" [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Button Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1903,1998],"source":" [Button Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
