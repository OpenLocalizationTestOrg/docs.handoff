A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier. The signatures of the two methods must match.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30437  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Check the return types of the two methods and change them as necessary to match.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [NOT IN BUILD: Overriding Properties and Methods](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2167e8f5-1225-4b13-9ebd-02591ba90213)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,138],"content":"&#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>method1<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; cannot override &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;lt;</ph>method2<ph id=\"ph4\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; because they differ by their return types | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,126],"source":"&#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[654,763],"content":"&#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types","linkify":"&#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>method1<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; cannot override &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;lt;</ph>method2<ph id=\"ph4\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; because they differ by their return types","pos":[0,109],"source":"&#39;&lt;method1&gt;&#39; cannot override &#39;&lt;method2&gt;&#39; because they differ by their return types"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to override a method with another method that differs by its return type.","pos":[764,856]},{"content":"A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Overrides`</ph> modifier.","pos":[857,1023],"source":" A type may override an inherited overridable method by declaring a method with the same name and signature, and marking the declaration with the `Overrides` modifier."},{"content":"The signatures of the two methods must match.","pos":[1024,1069]},{"pos":[1076,1097],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30437","source":"**Error ID:** BC30437"},{"pos":[1106,1127],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check the return types of the two methods and change them as necessary to match.","pos":[1137,1217]},{"pos":[1226,1234],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1238,1357],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>NOT IN BUILD: Overriding Properties and Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2167e8f5-1225-4b13-9ebd-02591ba90213)</ept>","source":"[NOT IN BUILD: Overriding Properties and Methods](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2167e8f5-1225-4b13-9ebd-02591ba90213)"}]}
