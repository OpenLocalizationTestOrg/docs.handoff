Includes information about using attributes to control marshaling for the API call and how to expose an API call as a method of a class.  \n  \n [Creating COM Objects with Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-creating-com-objects.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create COM objects in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], both with and without the COM class template.  \n  \n [Implementing Inheritance with COM Objects](../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-implementing-inheritance-with-com-objects.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] 6.0 to create a COM object containing a class, and then use it as a base class in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n [Multithreading](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2cbf5116-8499-4af9-818c-6f7c1c2ad2c9)  \n Shows how to create a multithreaded application that searches a text file for occurrences of a word.  \n  \n [Determining Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-determining-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  \n Describes the default `My.Application.Log` settings and how to determine the settings for your application.  \n  \n [Changing Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-changing-where-my-application-log-writes-information.md)  \n Shows how to override the default `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` settings for logging event information and cause the `Log` object to write to other log listeners.  \n  \n [Filtering My.Application.Log Output](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-filtering-my-application-log-output.md)  \n Demonstrates how to change the default log filtering for the `My.Application.Log` object.  \n  \n [Creating Custom Log Listeners](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/walkthrough-creating-custom-log-listeners.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a custom log listener and configure it to listen to the output of the `My.Application.Log` object.  \n  \n [Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/b28ec92c-1867-4847-95c0-61adfe095e21)  \n Describes how to create an assembly and a client program that embeds types from it.  \n  \n [Validating That Passwords Are Complex (Visual Basic)](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-validating-that-passwords-are-complex.md)  \n Demonstrates how to check for strong-password characteristics and update a string parameter with information about which checks a password fails.  \n  \n [Encrypting and Decrypting Strings in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/walkthrough-encrypting-and-decrypting-strings.md)  \n Shows how to use the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DESCryptoServiceProvider> class to encrypt and decrypt strings.  \n  \n [Manipulating Files and Folders in Visual Basic](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] functions to determine information about a file, search for a string in a file, and write to a file.  \n  \n [Manipulating Files Using .NET Framework Methods](../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] methods to determine information about a file, search for a string in a file, and write to a file.  \n  \n [Persisting an Object in Visual Basic](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cb0a0917-08d5-4578-ad2b-3764ccf6167f)  \n Demonstrates how to create a simple object and persist its data to a file.  \n  \n [Test-First Support with the Generate from Usage Feature](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/764c17a4-cd95-4c23-bf63-d92d9c5adfb2)  \n Demonstrates how to do test-first development, in which you first write unit tests and then write the source code to make the tests succeed.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,63],"content":"Visual Basic Language Walkthroughs | Microsoft
