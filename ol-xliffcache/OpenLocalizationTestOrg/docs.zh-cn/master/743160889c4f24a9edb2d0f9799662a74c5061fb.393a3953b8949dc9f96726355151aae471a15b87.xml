For example, the `My.Forms` object is available in a Windows Forms application but not available in a console application. This topic describes which `My` objects are available in different project types.  \n  \n## My in Windows Applications and Web Sites  \n `My` exposes only objects that are useful in the current project type; it suppresses objects that are not applicable. For example, the following image shows the `My` object model in a Windows Forms project.  \n  \n ![Shape of My in a Windows Forms application](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/media/myinwinform.png \"MyInWinForm\")  \n  \n In a Web site project, `My` exposes objects that are relevant to a Web developer (such as the `My.Request` and `My.Response` objects) while suppressing objects that are not relevant (such as the `My.Forms` object). The following image shows the `My` object model in a Web site project:  \n  \n ![Shape of My in a Web application](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/media/myinweb.png \"MyInWeb\")  \n  \n## Project Details  \n The following table shows which `My` objects are enabled by default for eight project types: Windows application, class Library, console application, Windows control library, Web control library, Windows service, empty, and Web site.  \n  \n There are three versions of the `My.Application` object, two versions of the `My.Computer` object, and two versions of `My.User` object; details about these versions are given in the footnotes after the table.  \n  \n|My Object|Windows Application|Class Library|Console Application|Windows Control Library|Web Control Library|Windows Service|Empty|Web Site|  \n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|  \n|`My.Application`|**Yes** <sup>1</sup>|**Yes** <sup>2</sup>|**Yes** <sup>3</sup>|**Yes** <sup>2</sup>|No|**Yes** <sup>3</sup>|No|No|  \n|`My.Computer`|**Yes** <sup>4</sup>|**Yes** <sup>4</sup>|**Yes** <sup>4</sup>|**Yes** <sup>4</sup>|**Yes** <sup>5</sup>|**Yes** <sup>4</sup>|No|**Yes** <sup>5</sup>|  \n|`My.Forms`|**Yes**|No|No|**Yes**|No|No|No|No|  \n|`My.Log`|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|**Yes**|  \n|`My.Request`|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|**Yes**|  \n|`My.Resources`|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|No|No|  \n|`My.Response`|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|**Yes**|  \n|`My.Settings`|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|No|No|  \n|`My.User`|**Yes** <sup>6</sup>|**Yes** <sup>6</sup>|**Yes** <sup>6</sup>|**Yes** <sup>6</sup>|**Yes** <sup>7</sup>|**Yes** <sup>6</sup>|No|**Yes** <sup>7</sup>|  \n|`My.WebServices`|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|No|No|  \n  \n <sup>1</sup> Windows Forms version of `My.Application`. Derives from the console version (see Note 3); adds support for interacting with the application's windows and provides the Visual Basic Application model.  \n  \n <sup>2</sup> Library version of `My.Application`. Provides the basic functionality needed by an application: provides members for writing to the application log and accessing application information.  \n  \n <sup>3</sup> Console version of `My.Application`. Derives from the library version (see Note 2), and adds additional members for accessing the application's command-line arguments and ClickOnce deployment information.  \n  \n <sup>4</sup> Windows version of `My.Computer`. Derives from the Server version (see Note 5), and provides access to useful objects on a client machine, such as the keyboard, screen, and mouse.  \n  \n <sup>5</sup> Server version of `My.Computer`. Provides basic information about the computer, such as the name, access to the clock, and so on.  \n  \n <sup>6</sup> Windows version of `My.User`. This object is associated with the thread's current identity.  \n  \n <sup>7</sup> Web version of `My.User`. This object is associated with the user identity of the application's current HTTP request.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase>\n-
