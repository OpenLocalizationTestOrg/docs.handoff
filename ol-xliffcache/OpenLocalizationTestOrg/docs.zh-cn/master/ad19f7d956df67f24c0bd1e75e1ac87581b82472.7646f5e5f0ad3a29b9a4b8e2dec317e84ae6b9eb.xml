Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type.  \n  \n The following code causes this error:  \n  \n```vb  \n' Select Case (Function(arg) arg Is Nothing)  \n    ' List of the cases.  \n' End Select  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36635  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you.  \n  \n-   You may have intended to call the function, as shown in the following code:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim num? As Integer  \nSelect Case ((Function(arg? As Integer) arg Is Nothing)(num))  \n    ' List of the cases  \nEnd Select  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)   \n [If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)   \n [Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,122],"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &amp;#39;Select Case&amp;#39; statement | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,110],"source":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[660,753],"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement","linkify":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement","nodes":[{"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &amp;#39;Select Case&amp;#39; statement","pos":[0,93],"source":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a &#39;Select Case&#39; statement"}]},{"content":"You cannot use a lambda expression for the test expression in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Select Case`</ph> statement.","pos":[754,842],"source":"You cannot use a lambda expression for the test expression in a `Select Case` statement."},{"content":"Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Select Case`</ph> statement must be an elementary data type.","pos":[843,976],"source":" Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type."},{"content":"The following code causes this error:","pos":[983,1020]},{"pos":[1133,1154],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36635","source":"**Error ID:** BC36635"},{"pos":[1163,1184],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1194,1331],"content":"Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`If...Then...Else`</ph> statement, would work for you.","source":"Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you."},{"content":"You may have intended to call the function, as shown in the following code:","pos":[1341,1416]},{"pos":[1567,1575],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1579,1692],"source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1695,1804],"source":" [If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Select...Case Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1807,1911],"source":" [Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)"}]}
