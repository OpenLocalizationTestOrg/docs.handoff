Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:  \n  \n (N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,97],"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,85]}]},{"pos":[406,474],"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,68]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[475,547]},{"pos":[556,567],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[571,715]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[716,738]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[748,793]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[803,870]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[880,959]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[969,1057]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[1067,1101]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[1111,1220]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[1230,1283]},{"pos":[1290,1458],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula:","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:"},{"content":"(N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","pos":[1465,1484]}]}
