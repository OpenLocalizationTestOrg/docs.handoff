This topic demonstrates how to determine the amount of time a service operation takes to complete.  \n  \n### Determining service operation execution duration  \n  \n1.  Open Event Viewer by clicking **Start**, **Run**, and entering `eventvwr.exe`.  \n  \n2.  If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Windows**, **Application Server-Applications**. Select **View**, **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**. Right-click **Analytic** and select **Enable Log**. Leave Event Viewer open so that traces can be viewed after the service operation is run.  \n  \n3.  Next, open a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application that includes a service project and a client project that interacts with that service.  You can create such an application by following the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  If you have the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] samples installed, you can open the [Getting Started](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which contains the completed project created in the tutorial.  \n  \n4.  Execute the server application by pressing **F5**. Execute the client application by right-clicking on the **Client** project and selecting **Debug**, **Start New Instance**.  \n  \n5.  In Event Viewer, refresh the Analytic log and sort the events by Event ID.  Look for events with Event ID [214 - OperationCompleted](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/214-operationcompleted.md).  These events will show which operations have completed, and what the duration of the operation was.  The following event shows the duration of an Add operation.  \n  \n    ```Output  \n    An OperationInvoker completed the call to the 'Add' method.  The method call duration was '3' ms.  \n    ```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"Determining service operation duration | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation duration | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[365,403],"content":"Determining service operation duration","linkify":"Determining service operation duration","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation duration","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"If analytic tracing is enabled in a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> application, the duration of execution for a service operation can easily be determined by examining the event log.","pos":[404,614],"source":"If analytic tracing is enabled in a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] application, the duration of execution for a service operation can easily be determined by examining the event log."},{"content":"This topic demonstrates how to determine the amount of time a service operation takes to complete.","pos":[616,714]},{"pos":[724,772],"content":"Determining service operation execution duration","linkify":"Determining service operation execution duration","nodes":[{"content":"Determining service operation execution duration","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[782,860],"content":"Open Event Viewer by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Run<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and entering <ph id=\"ph1\">`eventvwr.exe`</ph>.","source":"Open Event Viewer by clicking **Start**, **Run**, and entering `eventvwr.exe`."},{"content":"If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Applications and Services Logs<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Microsoft<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Windows<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Application Server-Applications<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept>.","pos":[870,1018],"source":"If you haven’t enabled analytic tracing, expand **Applications and Services Logs**, **Microsoft**, **Windows**, **Application Server-Applications**."},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>View<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Show Analytic and Debug Logs<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1019,1069],"source":" Select **View**, **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**."},{"content":"Right-click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Analytic<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> and select <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Enable Log<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","pos":[1070,1121],"source":" Right-click **Analytic** and select **Enable Log**."},{"content":"Leave Event Viewer open so that traces can be viewed after the service operation is run.","pos":[1122,1210]},{"content":"Next, open a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> application that includes a service project and a client project that interacts with that service.","pos":[1220,1390],"source":"Next, open a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] application that includes a service project and a client project that interacts with that service."},{"content":"You can create such an application by following the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started Tutorial<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md)</ept>.","pos":[1392,1534],"source":"  You can create such an application by following the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md)."},{"content":"If you have the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> samples installed, you can open the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Getting Started<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md)</ept>, which contains the completed project created in the tutorial.","pos":[1536,1796],"source":"  If you have the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] samples installed, you can open the [Getting Started](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which contains the completed project created in the tutorial."},{"content":"Execute the server application by pressing <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>F5<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1806,1856],"source":"Execute the server application by pressing **F5**."},{"content":"Execute the client application by right-clicking on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Client<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project and selecting <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Debug<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Start New Instance<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","pos":[1857,1980],"source":" Execute the client application by right-clicking on the **Client** project and selecting **Debug**, **Start New Instance**."},{"content":"In Event Viewer, refresh the Analytic log and sort the events by Event ID.","pos":[1990,2064]},{"content":"Look for events with Event ID <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>214 -
