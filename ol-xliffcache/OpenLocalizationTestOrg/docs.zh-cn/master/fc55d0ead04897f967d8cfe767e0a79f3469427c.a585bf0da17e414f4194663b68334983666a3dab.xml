To demonstrate building and using a DLL, consider the following scenario:  \n  \n-   `MathLibrary.DLL`: The library file that contains the methods to be called at run time. In this example, the DLL contains two methods, `Add` and `Multiply`.  \n  \n-   `Add`: The source file that contains the method `Add`. It returns the sum of its parameters. The class `AddClass` that contains the method `Add` is a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  \n  \n-   `Mult`: The source code that contains the method `Multiply`. It returns the product of its parameters. The class `MultiplyClass` that contains the method `Multiply` is also a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  \n  \n-   `TestCode`: The file that contains the `Main` method. It uses the methods in the DLL file to calculate the sum and the product of the run-time arguments.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \n// File: Add.cs   \nnamespace UtilityMethods  \n{  \n    public class AddClass   \n    {  \n        public static long Add(long i, long j)   \n        {   \n            return (i + j);  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \n// File: Mult.cs  \nnamespace UtilityMethods   \n{  \n    public class MultiplyClass  \n    {  \n        public static long Multiply(long x, long y)   \n        {  \n            return (x * y);   \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \n// File: TestCode.cs  \n  \nusing UtilityMethods;  \n  \nclass TestCode  \n{  \n    static void Main(string[] args)   \n    {  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:\");  \n  \n        if (args.Length != 2)  \n        {  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: TestCode <num1> <num2>\");  \n            return;  \n        }  \n  \n        long num1 = long.Parse(args[0]);  \n        long num2 = long.Parse(args[1]);  \n  \n        long sum = AddClass.Add(num1, num2);  \n        long product = MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2);  \n  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"{0} + {1} = {2}\", num1, num2, sum);  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"{0} * {1} = {2}\", num1, num2, product);  \n    }  \n}  \n/* Output (assuming 1234 and 5678 are entered as command-line arguments):  \n    Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:  \n    1234 + 5678 = 6912  \n    1234 * 5678 = 7006652          \n*/  \n```  \n  \n This file contains the algorithm that uses the DLL methods, `Add` and `Multiply`. It starts with parsing the arguments entered from the command line, `num1` and `num2`. Then it calculates the sum by using the `Add` method on the `AddClass` class, and the product by using the `Multiply` method on the `MultiplyClass` class.  \n  \n Notice that the `using` directive at the beginning of the file enables you to use the unqualified class names to reference the DLL methods at compile time, as follows:  \n  \n```csharp  \nMultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2);  \n```  \n  \n Otherwise, you have to use the fully qualified names, as follows:  \n  \n```csharp  \nUtilityMethods.MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2);  \n```  \n  \n## Execution  \n To run the program, enter the name of the EXE file, followed by two numbers, as follows:  \n  \n `TestCode 1234 5678`  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To build the file `MathLibrary.DLL`, compile the two files `Add` and `Mult` by using the following command line.  \n  \n```csharp  \ncsc /target:library /out:MathLibrary.DLL Add.cs Mult.cs  \n```  \n  \n The [/target:library](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/target-library-compiler-option.md) compiler option tells the compiler to output a DLL instead of an EXE file. The [/out](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/out-compiler-option.md) compiler option followed by a file name is used to specify the DLL file name. Otherwise, the compiler uses the first file (`Add.cs`) as the name of the DLL.  \n  \n To build the executable file, `TestCode.exe`, use the following command line:  \n  \n```csharp  \ncsc /out:TestCode.exe /reference:MathLibrary.DLL TestCode.cs  \n```  \n  \n The **/out** compiler option tells the compiler to output an EXE file and specifies the name of the output file (`TestCode.exe`). This compiler option is optional. The [/reference](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md) compiler option specifies the DLL file or files that this program uses.
