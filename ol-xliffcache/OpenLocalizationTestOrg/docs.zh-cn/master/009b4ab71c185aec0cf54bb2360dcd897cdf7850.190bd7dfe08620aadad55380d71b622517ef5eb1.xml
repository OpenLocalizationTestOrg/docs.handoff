Such methods are referred to as *async methods*.  \n  \n An async method provides a convenient way to do potentially long-running work without blocking the caller's thread. The caller of an async method can resume its work without waiting for the async method to finish.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `Async` and `Await` keywords were introduced in Visual Studio 2012. For an introduction to async programming, see [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md).  \n  \n The following example shows the structure of an async method. By convention, async method names end in \"Async.\"  \n  \n```vb  \n  \nPublic Async Function ExampleMethodAsync() As Task(Of Integer)  \n    ' . . .  \n  \n    ' At the Await expression, execution in this method is suspended and,  \n    ' if AwaitedProcessAsync has not already finished, control returns  \n    ' to the caller of ExampleMethodAsync. When the awaited task is   \n    ' completed, this method resumes execution.   \n    Dim exampleInt As Integer = Await AwaitedProcessAsync()  \n  \n    ' . . .  \n  \n    ' The return statement completes the task. Any method that is   \n    ' awaiting ExampleMethodAsync can now get the integer result.  \n    Return exampleInt  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n Typically, a method modified by the `Async` keyword contains at least one [Await](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/async.md) expression or statement. The method runs synchronously until it reaches the first `Await`, at which point it suspends until the awaited task completes. In the meantime, control is returned to the caller of the method. If the method doesn’t contain an `Await` expression or statement, the method isn’t suspended and executes as a synchronous method does. A compiler warning alerts you to any async methods that don't contain `Await` because that situation might indicate an error. For more information, see the [compiler error](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/because-this-call-is-not-awaited-the-current-method-continues-to-run.md).  \n  \n The `Async` keyword is an unreserved keyword. It is a keyword when it modifies a method or a lambda expression. In all other contexts, it is interpreted as an identifier.  \n  \n## Return Types  \n An async method is either a [Sub](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/sub-procedures.md) procedure, or a [Function](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/function-procedures.md) procedure that has a return type of <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>. The method cannot declare any [ByRef](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/byref.md) parameters.  \n  \n You specify `Task(Of TResult)` for the return type of an async method if the [Return](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md) statement of the method has an operand of type TResult. You use `Task` if no meaningful value is returned when the method is completed. That is, a call to the method returns a `Task`, but when the `Task` is completed, any `Await` statement that's awaiting the `Task` doesn’t produce a result value.  \n  \n Async subroutines are used primarily to define event handlers where a `Sub` procedure is required. The caller of an async subroutine can't await it and can't catch exceptions that the method throws.  \n  \n For more information and examples, see [Async Return Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/async-return-types.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following examples show an async event handler, an async lambda expression, and an async method. For a full example that uses these elements, see [Walkthrough: Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md). You can download the walkthrough code from [Developer Code Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=255191).  \n  \n```vb  \n  \n' An event handler must be a Sub procedure.  \nAsync Sub button1_Click(sender As Object, e As RoutedEventArgs) Handles button1.Click  \n    textBox1.Clear()  \n    ' SumPageSizesAsync is a method that returns a Task.  \n    Await SumPageSizesAsync()  \n    textBox1.Text = vbCrLf & \"Control returned to button1_Click.\"  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n' The following async lambda expression creates an equivalent anonymous  \n' event handler.  \nAddHandler button1.Click, Async Sub(sender, e)  \n                              textBox1.Clear()  \n                              ' SumPageSizesAsync is a method that returns a Task.  \n                              Await SumPageSizesAsync()  \n                              textBox1.Text = vbCrLf & \"Control returned to button1_Click.\"  \n                          End Sub  \n  \n' The following async method returns a Task(Of T).  \n' A typical call awaits the Byte array result:  \n'      Dim result As Byte() = Await GetURLContents(\"http://msdn.com\")  \nPrivate Async Function GetURLContentsAsync(url As String) As Task(Of Byte())  \n  \n    ' The downloaded resource ends up in the variable named content.  \n    Dim content = New MemoryStream()  \n  \n    ' Initialize an HttpWebRequest for the current URL.  \n    Dim webReq = CType(WebRequest.Create(url), HttpWebRequest)  \n  \n    ' Send the request to the Internet resource and wait for  \n    ' the response.  \n    Using response As WebResponse = Await webReq.GetResponseAsync()  \n        ' Get the data stream that is associated with the specified URL.  \n        Using responseStream As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()  \n            ' Read the bytes in responseStream and copy them to content.    \n            ' CopyToAsync returns a Task, not a Task<T>.  \n            Await responseStream.CopyToAsync(content)  \n        End Using  \n    End Using  \n  \n    ' Return the result as a byte array.  \n    Return content.ToArray()  \nEnd Function  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.AsyncStateMachineAttribute>   \n [Await Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/await-operator.md)   \n [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,579],"nodes":[{"content":"Async (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"Async (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Async (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]}],"pos":[6,46],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Async (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vb.Async\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Async [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"Async keyword [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: 1be8b4b5-9689-41b5-bd33-b906bfd53bc5\ncaps.latest.revision: 37\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[586,606],"content":"Async (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Async (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Async (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Async`</ph> modifier indicates that the method or <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>lambda expression<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept> that it modifies is asynchronous.","pos":[607,802],"source":"The `Async` modifier indicates that the method or [lambda expression](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md) that it modifies is asynchronous."},{"content":"Such methods are referred to as <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>async methods<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[803,851],"source":" Such methods are referred to as *async methods*."},{"content":"An async method provides a convenient way to do potentially long-running work without blocking the caller's thread.","pos":[858,973]},{"content":"The caller of an async method can resume its work without waiting for the async method to finish.","pos":[974,1071]},{"pos":[1079,1321],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `Async` and `Await` keywords were introduced in Visual Studio 2012.
