You can use it to initialize a named delegate or pass it instead of a named delegate type as a method parameter.  \n  \n There are two kinds of anonymous functions, which are discussed individually in the following topics:  \n  \n-   [Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md).  \n  \n-   [Anonymous Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/anonymous-methods.md)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Lambda expressions can be bound to expression trees and also to delegates.  \n  \n## The Evolution of Delegates in C#  \n In C# 1.0, you created an instance of a delegate by explicitly initializing it with a method that was defined elsewhere in the code. C# 2.0 introduced the concept of anonymous methods as a way to write unnamed inline statement blocks that can be executed in a delegate invocation. C# 3.0 introduced lambda expressions, which are similar in concept to anonymous methods but more expressive and concise. These two features are known collectively as *anonymous functions*. In general, applications that target version 3.5 and later of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] should use lambda expressions.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates the evolution of delegate creation from C# 1.0 to C# 3.0:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#65](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/anonymous-functions_1.cs)]  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Statements, Expressions, and Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/index.md)   \n [Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md)   \n [Delegates](../../../csharp/programming-guide/delegates/index.md)   \n [Expression Trees](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/fb1d3ed8-d5b0-4211-a71f-dd271529294b)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,627],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Anonymous Functions (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  -
