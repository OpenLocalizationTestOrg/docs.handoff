Another attempt is made within the specified timeout period.  \n  \n## Description  \n This informational trace indicates that an error has occurred while attempting to reuse a pooled connection. This could happen because the pooled connection was not compatible, ready, or still active. Additional attempts to reuse other pooled connection are made within a given timeout and a new connection is created in case no usable connections are found.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,133],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: d535b1b5-ee58-45e8-b400-7d9570f4eb9a","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","pos":[0,49]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[140,189],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"An attempt to reuse a pooled connection failed.","pos":[190,237]},{"content":"Another attempt is made within the specified timeout period.","pos":[238,298]},{"pos":[307,318],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This informational trace indicates that an error has occurred while attempting to reuse a pooled connection.","pos":[322,430]},{"content":"This could happen because the pooled connection was not compatible, ready, or still active.","pos":[431,522]},{"content":"Additional attempts to reuse other pooled connection are made within a given timeout and a new connection is created in case no usable connections are found.","pos":[523,680]},{"pos":[689,697],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[701,774],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[777,930],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[933,1021],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
