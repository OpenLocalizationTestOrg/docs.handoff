It is configured through a Web.config file by specifying a service behavior.  \n  \n### Configure Tracking in Configuration  \n  \n1.  Add the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> using the <`behavior`> element in a configuration file, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <behaviors>  \n       <serviceBehaviors>  \n         <behavior>  \n           <etwTracking profileName=\"Sample Tracking Profile\" />  \n         </behavior>              \n       </serviceBehaviors>  \n    <behaviors>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The preceding configuration sample is using simplified configuration. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][Simplified Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md).  \n  \n     The preceding configuration sample adds a <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> and specifies a tracking profile name. Tracking profiles are created in a <`trackingProfile`> element within a <`tracking`> element. The tracking profile contains tracking queries that permit a tracking participant to subscribe to workflow events that are emitted when the state of a workflow instance changes at runtime. The following example shows how to create a tracking profile.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <system.serviceModel>  \n        <tracking>   \n         <trackingProfile name=\"Sample Tracking Profile\">  \n            <workflow activityDefinitionId=\"*\">  \n               <workflowInstanceQueries>  \n                 <workflowInstanceQuery>  \n                    <states>  \n                       <state name=\"Started\"/>  \n                       <state name=\"Completed\"/>  \n                    </states>  \n                </workflowInstanceQuery>  \n             </workflowInstanceQueries>  \n           </workflow>  \n         </trackingProfile>   \n       </tracking>  \n    </system.serviceModel>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] tracking profiles, see [Tracking Profiles](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).  \n  \n     [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] tracking in general, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md).  \n  \n### Configure Tracking in Code  \n  \n1.  Add the <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.EtwTrackingBehavior> behavior in code, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    host.Description.Behaviors.Add(new EtwTrackingBehavior { ProfileName = \"Sample Tracking Profile\" });  \n    ```  \n  \n     The preceding code sample adds a <xref:System.Activities.Tracking.EtwTrackingParticipant> and specifies a tracking profile name. Tracking profiles are created in a <`trackingProfile`> element within a <`tracking`> element as shown in the previous section.  \n  \n     [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] tracking profiles, see [Tracking Profiles](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/tracking-profiles.md).  \n  \n     [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] tracking in general, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md).
