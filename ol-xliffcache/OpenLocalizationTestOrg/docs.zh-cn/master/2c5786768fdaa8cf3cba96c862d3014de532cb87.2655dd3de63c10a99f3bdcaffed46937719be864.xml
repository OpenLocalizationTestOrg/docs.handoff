The contract-first workflow development tool allows you to design the contract in code first. The tool then automatically generates an activity template in the toolbox for the operations in the contract.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This topic provides step-by-step guidance on creating a contract-first workflow service. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] contract-first workflow service development, see [Contract First Workflow Service Development](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/contract-first-workflow-service-development.md).  \n  \n### Creating the workflow project  \n  \n1.  In [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], select **File**, **New Project**. Select the **WCF** node under the **C#** node in the **Templates** tree, and select the **WCF Workflow Service Application** template.  \n  \n2.  Name the new project `ContractFirst` and click **Ok**.  \n  \n### Creating the service contract  \n  \n1.  Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Item…**. Select the **Code** node on the left, and the **Class** template on the right. Name the new class `IBookService` and click **Ok**.  \n  \n2.  In the top of the code window that appears, add a Using statement to `System.Servicemodel`.  \n  \n    ```  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Change the sample class definition to the following interface definition.  \n  \n    ```  \n    [ServiceContract]  \n        public interface IBookService  \n        {  \n            [OperationContract]  \n            void Buy(string bookName);  \n  \n            [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]  \n            void Checkout();  \n        }  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  Build the project by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+B**.  \n  \n### Importing the service contract  \n  \n1.  Right-click the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Import Service Contract**. Under **\\<Current Project>**, open all sub-nodes and select **IBookService**. Click **OK**.  \n  \n2.  A dialog will open, alerting you that the operation completed successfully, and that the generated activities will appear in the toolbox after you build the project. Click **OK**.  \n  \n3.  Build the project by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+B**, so that the imported activities will appear in the toolbox.  \n  \n4.  In **Solution Explorer**, open Service1.xamlx. The workflow service will appear in the designer.  \n  \n5.  Select the **Sequence** activity. In the Properties window, click the **…** button in the **ImplementedContract** property. In the **Type Collection Editor** window that appears, click the **Type** dropdown, and select the **Browse for Types…** entry. In the **Browse and Select a .Net Type** dialog, under **\\<Current Project>**, open all sub-nodes and select **IBookService**. Click **OK**. In the **Type Collection Editor** dialog, click **OK**.  \n  \n6.  Select and delete the **ReceiveRequest** and **SendResponse** activities.  \n  \n7.  From the toolbox, drag a **Buy_ReceiveAndSendReply** and a **Checkout_Receive** activity onto the **Sequential Service** activity.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,105],"content":"How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,93]}]},{"pos":[370,446],"content":"How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract","linkify":"How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]</ph> features better integration between web services and workflows in the form of contract-first workflow development.","pos":[447,614],"source":"[!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] features better integration between web services and workflows in the form of contract-first workflow development."},{"content":"The contract-first workflow development tool allows you to design the contract in code first.","pos":[615,708]},{"content":"The tool then automatically generates an activity template in the toolbox for the operations in the contract.","pos":[709,818]},{"pos":[826,1174],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This topic provides step-by-step guidance on creating a contract-first workflow service.
