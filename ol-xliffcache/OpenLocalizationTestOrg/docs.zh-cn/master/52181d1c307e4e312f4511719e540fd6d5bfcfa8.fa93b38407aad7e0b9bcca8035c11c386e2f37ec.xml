Custom events allow the event to call its event handlers asynchronously.  \n  \n By default, the backing-store field for an event declaration is a multicast delegate that serially combines all the event handlers. This means that if one handler takes a long time to complete, it blocks the other handlers until it completes. (Well-behaved event handlers should never perform lengthy or potentially blocking operations.)  \n  \n Instead of using the default implementation of events that Visual Basic provides, you can use a custom event to execute the event handlers asynchronously.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, the `AddHandler` accessor adds the delegate for each handler of the `Click` event to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> stored in the `EventHandlerList` field.  \n  \n When code raises the `Click` event, the `RaiseEvent` accessor invokes all the event handler delegates asynchronously using the <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A> method. That method invokes each handler on a worker thread and returns immediately, so handlers cannot block one another.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrEvents#27](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-avoid-blocking_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>   \n <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A>   \n [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)   \n [How to: Declare Custom Events To Conserve Memory](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-conserve-memory.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,91],"content":"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,79]}]},{"pos":[673,735],"content":"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Declare Custom Events To Avoid Blocking (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"There are several circumstances when it is important that one event handler not block subsequent event handlers.","pos":[736,848]},{"content":"Custom events allow the event to call its event handlers asynchronously.","pos":[849,921]},{"content":"By default, the backing-store field for an event declaration is a multicast delegate that serially combines all the event handlers.","pos":[928,1059]},{"content":"This means that if one handler takes a long time to complete, it blocks the other handlers until it completes.","pos":[1060,1170]},{"content":"(Well-behaved event handlers should never perform lengthy or potentially blocking operations.)","pos":[1171,1265]},{"content":"Instead of using the default implementation of events that Visual Basic provides, you can use a custom event to execute the event handlers asynchronously.","pos":[1272,1426]},{"pos":[1435,1442],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1446,1626],"content":"In this example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddHandler`</ph> accessor adds the delegate for each handler of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Click`</ph> event to an <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.ArrayList&gt;</ph> stored in the <ph id=\"ph4\">`EventHandlerList`</ph> field.","source":"In this example, the `AddHandler` accessor adds the delegate for each handler of the `Click` event to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> stored in the `EventHandlerList` field."},{"content":"When code raises the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Click`</ph> event, the <ph id=\"ph2\">`RaiseEvent`</ph> accessor invokes all the event handler delegates asynchronously using the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1633,1837],"source":"When code raises the `Click` event, the `RaiseEvent` accessor invokes all the event handler delegates asynchronously using the <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A> method."},{"content":"That method invokes each handler on a worker thread and returns immediately, so handlers cannot block one another.","pos":[1838,1952]},{"pos":[1959,2119],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>VbVbalrEvents#27<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-avoid-blocking_1.vb)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-vb[VbVbalrEvents#27](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-avoid-blocking_1.vb)]"},{"pos":[2128,2136],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.ArrayList&gt;</ph>","pos":[2140,2175],"source":"<xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> "},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A&gt;</ph>","pos":[2180,2249],"source":" <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.LogicalMethodInfo.BeginInvoke%2A> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2253,2341],"source":" [Events](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Declare Custom Events To Conserve Memory<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-conserve-memory.md)</ept>","pos":[2344,2515],"source":" [How to: Declare Custom Events To Conserve Memory](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/how-to-declare-custom-events-to-conserve-memory.md)"}]}
