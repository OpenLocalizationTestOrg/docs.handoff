If you are writing entries to an event log, you must specify the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property. The <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property registers your component with the event log as a valid source of entries. A single source can be associated with (and therefore write entries to) only one event log at a time.  \n  \n By default, if you try to write an entry without first having registered your component as a valid source, the system automatically registers the source with the event log, using the value of the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.Source%2A> property as the source string.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure the source is registered to the correct log. To do this, use the <xref:System.Diagnostics.EventLog.CreateEventSource%2A> method or one of its overloads to specify a string that uniquely identifies your component to the event log.  \n  \n## See
