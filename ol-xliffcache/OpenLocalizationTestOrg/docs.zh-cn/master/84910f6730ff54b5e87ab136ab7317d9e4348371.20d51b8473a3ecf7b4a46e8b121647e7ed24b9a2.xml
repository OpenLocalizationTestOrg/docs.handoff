The event contains an argument (the panel argument), which contains a reference to the clicked <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanel>. Using this reference, you can determine the index of the clicked panel, and program accordingly.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Ensure that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.ShowPanels%2A> property is set to `true`.  \n  \n### To determine which panel was clicked  \n  \n1.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar.PanelClick> event handler, use a `Select Case` (in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]) or `switch case` ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) statement to determine which panel was clicked by examining the index of the clicked panel in the event arguments.  \n  \n     The following code example requires the presence, on the form, of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> control, `StatusBar1`, and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanel> objects,`StatusBarPanel1` and`StatusBarPanel2`.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub StatusBar1_PanelClick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanelClickEventArgs) Handles StatusBar1.PanelClick  \n       Select Case StatusBar1.Panels.IndexOf(e.StatusBarPanel)  \n         Case 0  \n           MessageBox.Show(\"You have clicked Panel One.\")  \n         Case 1  \n           MessageBox.Show(\"You have clicked Panel Two.\")  \n       End Select  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void statusBar1_PanelClick(object sender,   \n    System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanelClickEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       switch (statusBar1.Panels.IndexOf(e.StatusBarPanel))  \n       {  \n          case 0 :  \n             MessageBox.Show(\"You have clicked Panel One.\");  \n             break;  \n          case 1 :  \n             MessageBox.Show(\"You have clicked Panel Two.\");  \n             break;  \n       }  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void statusBar1_PanelClick(System::Object ^  sender,  \n

MessageBox::Show(\"You have clicked Panel One.\");  \n                break;  \n             case 1 :  \n                MessageBox::Show(\"You have clicked Panel Two.\");  \n                break;

constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.statusBar1.PanelClick += new   \n       System.Windows.Forms.StatusBarPanelClickEventHandler   \n
