Two tools are available for automatically generating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# model from the metadata of an existing database.  \n  \n-   If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to generate an object model. The [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] provides a rich user interface to help you generate a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model.  \n  \n-   The SQLMetal command-line tool. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you do not have an existing database and want to create one from an object model, you can create your object model by using your code editor and <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.CreateDatabase%2A>. For more information, see [How to: Dynamically Create a Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-dynamically-create-a-database.md).  \n  \n Documentation for the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] provides examples of how to generate a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# object model by using the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)]. The following information provide examples of how to use the SQLMetal command-line tool. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The SQLMetal command line shown in the following example produces [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] code as the attribute-based object model of the Northwind sample database. Stored procedures and functions are also rendered.  \n  \n```  \nsqlmetal /code:northwind.vb /language:vb \"c:\\northwnd.mdf\" /sprocs /functions  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The SQLMetal command line shown in the following example produces C# code as the attribute-based object model of the Northwind sample database. Stored procedures and functions are also rendered, and table names are automatically pluralized.  \n  \n```  \nsqlmetal /code:northwind.cs /language:csharp \"c:\\northwnd.mdf\" /sprocs /functions /pluralize  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Programming Guide](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/programming-guide.md)   \n [The LINQ to SQL Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/the-linq-to-sql-object-model.md)   \n [Learning by Walkthroughs](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/learning-by-walkthroughs.md)   \n [How to: Customize Entity Classes by Using the Code Editor](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-customize-entity-classes-by-using-the-code-editor.md)   \n [Attribute-Based Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/attribute-based-mapping.md)   \n [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md)   \n [External Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/external-mapping.md)   \n [Downloading Sample Databases](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases.md)   \n [Creating the Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/creating-the-object-model.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,84],"content":"How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C# | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C# | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[393,448],"content":"How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C#","linkify":"How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C#","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C#","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph>, an object model in your own programming language is mapped to a relational database.","pos":[451,607],"source":"In [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)], an object model in your own programming language is mapped to a relational database."},{"content":"Two tools are available for automatically generating a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]</ph> or C# model from the metadata of an existing database.","pos":[608,777],"source":" Two tools are available for automatically generating a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# model from the metadata of an existing database."},{"content":"If you are using <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)]</ph>, you can use the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)]</ph> to generate an object model.","pos":[787,1013],"source":"If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to generate an object model."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)]</ph> provides a rich user interface to help you generate a <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> object model.","pos":[1014,1239],"source":" The [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-short-md.md)] provides a rich user interface to help you generate a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model."},{"content":"The SQLMetal command-line tool.","pos":[1249,1280]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md)</ept>.","pos":[1281,1422],"source":" For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../../../../../../docs/framework/tools/sqlmetal-exe-code-generation-tool.md)."},{"pos":[1434,1813],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIf you do not have an existing database and want to create one from an object model, you can create your object model by using your code editor and <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.CreateDatabase%2A>.
