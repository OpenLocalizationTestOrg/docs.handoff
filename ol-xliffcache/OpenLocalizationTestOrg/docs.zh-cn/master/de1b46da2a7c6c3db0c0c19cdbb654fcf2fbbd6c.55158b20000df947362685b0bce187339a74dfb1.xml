You can improve the load time by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing` attached property to `true`.  The UI might also be slow to react when a user scrolls the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> by using the mouse wheel or dragging the thumb of a scrollbar. You can improve the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> when the user scrolls by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n## Description  \nThe following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> that sets the `VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing` attached property to true and the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType> to optimize its performance.  \n  \n## Code  \n [!code-xaml[RecycleItemContainerShippets#VirtualizingTreeView](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml#virtualizingtreeview)]  \n  \n The following example shows the data that the previous example uses.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RecycleItemContainerShippets#TreeViewData](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#treeviewdata)]\n [!code-vb[RecycleItemContainerShippets#TreeViewData](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#treeviewdata)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Controls](../advanced/optimizing-performance-controls.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,241],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Improve the Performance of a TreeView\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
