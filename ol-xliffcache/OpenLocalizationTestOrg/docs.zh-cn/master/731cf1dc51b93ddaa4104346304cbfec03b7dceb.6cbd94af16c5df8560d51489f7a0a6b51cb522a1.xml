This type of application is called a Windows service. With framework features, you can create services, install them, and start, stop, and otherwise control their behavior.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  The Windows service template for C++ was not included in Visual Studio 2010. To create a Windows service, you can either create a service in managed code in Visual C# or Visual Basic, which could interoperate with existing C++ code if required, or you can create a Windows service in native C++ by using the [ATL Project Wizard](/cpp/atl/reference/atl-project-wizard).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)  \n Provides an overview of Windows service applications, the lifetime of a service, and how service applications differ from other common project types.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Service Application in the Component Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/walkthrough-creating-a-windows-service-application-in-the-component-designer.md)  \n Provides an example of creating a service in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] and Visual C#.  \n  \n [Service Application Programming Architecture](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/service-application-programming-architecture.md)  \n Explains the language elements used in service programming.  \n  \n [How to: Create Windows Services](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-create-windows-services.md)  \n Describes the process of creating and configuring Windows services using the Windows service project template.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase>  \n Describes the major features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> class, which is used to create services.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller>  \n Describes the features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> class, which is used along with the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> class to install and uninstall your services.  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller>  \n Describes the features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> class, which is used along with the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> class to install and uninstall your service.  \n  \n [NIB Creating Projects from Templates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7c36d86a-6b79-4480-8228-0f925f1204b2)  \n Describes the projects types used in this chapter and how to choose between them.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[685,724],"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications","linkify":"Developing Windows Service Applications","nodes":[{"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Using Microsoft <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]</ph> or the Microsoft <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> SDK, you can easily create services by creating an application that is installed as a service.","pos":[725,964],"source":"Using Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] or the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] SDK, you can easily create services by creating an application that is installed as a service."},{"content":"This type of application is called a Windows service.","pos":[965,1018]},{"content":"With framework features, you can create services, install them, and start, stop, and otherwise control their behavior.","pos":[1019,1137]},{"pos":[1145,1527],"content":"[!WARNING]\n The Windows service template for C++ was not included in Visual Studio 2010.
