The Win32 implementation of `VirtualQuery` retrieves information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT VirtualQuery (  \n    [in]  void*    lpAddress,  \n    [out] void*    lpBuffer,  \n    [in]  SIZE_T   dwLength,  \n    [out] SIZE_T*  pResult  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `lpAddress`  \n [in] A pointer to the address in virtual memory to be queried.  \n  \n `lpBuffer`  \n [out] A pointer to a structure that contains information about the specified memory region.  \n  \n `dwLength`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the buffer that `lpBuffer` points to.  \n  \n `pResult`  \n [out] A pointer to the number of bytes returned by the information buffer.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`VirtualQuery` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `VirtualQuery` provides information about a range of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process. This implementation sets the value of the `pResult` parameter to the number of bytes returned in the information buffer, and returns an HRESULT value. In the Win32 `VirtualQuery` function, the return value is the buffer size. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The operating system's implementation of `VirtualQuery` does not incur deadlock and can run to completion with random threads suspended in user code. Use great caution when implementing a hosted version of this method.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IHostMemoryManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,715],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IHostMemoryManager::VirtualQuery Method | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
