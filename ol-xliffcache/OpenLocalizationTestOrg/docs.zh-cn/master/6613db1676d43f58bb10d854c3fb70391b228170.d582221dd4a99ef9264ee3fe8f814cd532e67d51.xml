Some common examples include the following:  \n  \n-   A try to instantiate a namespace (instead of a class)  \n  \n-   A try to call a field (instead of a method)  \n  \n-   A try to use a type as a variable  \n  \n-   A try to use an extern alias as a type.  \n  \n To resolve this error, make sure that the operation you are performing is valid for the type you are performing the operation on.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0118.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0118.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \nnamespace MyNamespace  \n{  \n   class MyClass  \n   {  \n      // MyNamespace not a class  \n      MyNamespace ix = new MyNamespace ();   // CS0118  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0118 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0118 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[566,587],"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0118","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0118","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'construct1_name' is a 'construct1' but is used like a 'construct2'","pos":[588,655]},{"content":"The compiler detected a situation in which a construct was used in some erroneous way or a disallowed operation was tried on a construct.","pos":[662,799]},{"content":"Some common examples include the following:","pos":[800,843]},{"content":"A try to instantiate a namespace (instead of a class)","pos":[853,906]},{"content":"A try to call a field (instead of a method)","pos":[916,959]},{"content":"A try to use a type as a variable","pos":[969,1002]},{"content":"A try to use an extern alias as a type.","pos":[1012,1051]},{"content":"To resolve this error, make sure that the operation you are performing is valid for the type you are performing the operation on.","pos":[1058,1187]},{"pos":[1196,1203],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0118.","pos":[1207,1245]}]}
