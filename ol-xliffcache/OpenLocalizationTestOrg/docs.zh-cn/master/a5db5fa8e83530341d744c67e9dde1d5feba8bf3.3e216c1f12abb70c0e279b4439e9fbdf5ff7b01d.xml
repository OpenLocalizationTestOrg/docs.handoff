The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (`==`) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (`!=`) operator, and finally a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D> structure and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structure are checked for equality using the static <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[3DGallery_procedural_snip#Point4DEqualityExample_csharp](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/3DGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/Misc3DOperationsExample.cs#point4dequalityexample_csharp)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.op_Equality%2A>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.op_Inequality%2A>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,88],"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,76]}]},{"pos":[705,764],"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","linkify":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Test Point4D structures for equality and inequality","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to test <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures for equality and inequality.","pos":[765,879],"source":"This example shows how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality."},{"content":"The following code illustrates how to test <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures for equality and inequality using the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> equality methods.","pos":[886,1083],"source":"The following code illustrates how to test <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures for equality and inequality using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> equality methods."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (<ph id=\"ph2\">`==`</ph>) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (<ph id=\"ph3\">`!=`</ph>) operator, and finally a <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D&gt;</ph> structure and a <ph id=\"ph5\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D&gt;</ph> structure are checked for equality using the static <ph id=\"ph6\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1085,1515],"source":"  The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structures are tested for equality using the overloaded equality (`==`) operator, then for inequality using the overloaded inequality (`!=`) operator, and finally a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point3D> structure and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D> structure are checked for equality using the static <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Point4D.Equals%2A> method."},{"pos":[1524,1531],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1535,1749],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>3DGallery_procedural_snip#Point4DEqualityExample_csharp<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/3DGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/Misc3DOperationsExample.cs#point4dequalityexample_csharp)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[3DGallery_procedural_snip#Point4DEqualityExample_csharp](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/3DGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/Misc3DOperationsExample.cs#point4dequalityexample_csharp)]"},{"pos":[1758,1766],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
