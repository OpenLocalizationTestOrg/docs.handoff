Data contracts allow you to pass structured data to and from services. In object-oriented programming, a type that inherits from another type can be used in place of the original type. In service-oriented programming, schemas rather than types are communicated and therefore, the relationship between types is not preserved. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.KnownTypeAttribute> attribute allows information about derived types to be included in the data contract. If this mechanism is not used, a derived type cannot be sent or received where a base type is expected.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The service contract for the service uses complex numbers, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \n// Define a service contract.  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic interface ICalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ComplexNumber Add(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ComplexNumber Subtract(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ComplexNumber Multiply(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    ComplexNumber Divide(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2);  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> is applied to the `ComplexNumber` class to indicate which fields of the class can be passed between the client and the service. The derived `ComplexNumberWithMagnitude` class can be used in place of `ComplexNumber`. The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.KnownTypeAttribute> attribute on the `ComplexNumber` type indicates this.  \n  \n```  \n[DataContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \n[KnownType(typeof(ComplexNumberWithMagnitude))]  \npublic class ComplexNumber  \n{  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public double Real = 0.0D;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public double Imaginary = 0.0D;  \n  \n    public ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary)  \n    {  \n        this.Real = real;  \n        this.Imaginary = imaginary;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The `ComplexNumberWithMagnitude` type derives from `ComplexNumber` but adds an additional data member, `Magnitude`.  \n  \n```  \n  \n[DataContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic class ComplexNumberWithMagnitude : ComplexNumber  \n{  \n    public ComplexNumberWithMagnitude(double real, double imaginary) :  \n        base(real, imaginary) { }  \n  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public double Magnitude  \n    {  \n        get { return Math.Sqrt(Imaginary*Imaginary  + Real*Real); }  \n        set { throw new NotImplementedException(); }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n To demonstrate the known types feature, the service is implemented in such a way that it returns a `ComplexNumberWithMagnitude` only for addition and subtraction. (Even though the contract specifies `ComplexNumber`, this is allowed because of the `KnownTypeAttribute` attribute). Multiplication and division still return the base `ComplexNumber` type.  \n  \n```  \npublic class DataContractCalculatorService : IDataContractCalculator  \n{  \n    public ComplexNumber Add(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2)  \n    {  \n        //Return the derived type.  \n        return new ComplexNumberWithMagnitude(n1.Real + n2.Real,  \n                                      n1.Imaginary + n2.Imaginary);  \n    }  \n  \n    public ComplexNumber Subtract(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2)  \n    {  \n        //Return the derived type.  \n        return new ComplexNumberWithMagnitude(n1.Real - n2.Real,   \n                                 n1.Imaginary - n2.Imaginary);  \n    }  \n  \n    public ComplexNumber Multiply(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2)  \n    {  \n        double real1 = n1.Real * n2.Real;  \n        double imaginary1 = n1.Real * n2.Imaginary;  \n        double imaginary2 = n2.Real * n1.Imaginary;  \n        double real2 = n1.Imaginary * n2.Imaginary * -1;  \n        //Return the base type.  \n        return new ComplexNumber(real1 + real2, imaginary1 +   \n                                                  imaginary2);  \n    }  \n  \n    public ComplexNumber Divide(ComplexNumber n1, ComplexNumber n2)  \n    {  \n        ComplexNumber conjugate = new ComplexNumber(n2.Real,   \n                                     -1*n2.Imaginary);  \n        ComplexNumber numerator = Multiply(n1, conjugate);  \n        ComplexNumber denominator = Multiply(n2, conjugate);  \n        //Return the base type.  \n        return new ComplexNumber(numerator.Real / denominator.Real,  \n                                             numerator.Imaginary);  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n On the client, both the service contract and the data contract are defined in the source file generatedClient.cs, which is generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) from service metadata. Because the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.KnownTypeAttribute> attribute is specified in the service's data contract, the client is able to receive both the `ComplexNumber` and `ComplexNumberWithMagnitude` classes when using the service. The client detects whether it got a `ComplexNumberWithMagnitude` and generate the appropriate output:  \n  \n```  \n// Create a client  \nDataContractCalculatorClient client =   \n    new DataContractCalculatorClient();  \n  \n// Call the Add service operation.  \nComplexNumber value1 = new ComplexNumber(); value1.real = 1; value1.imaginary = 2;  \nComplexNumber value2 = new ComplexNumber(); value2.real = 3; value2.imaginary = 4;  \nComplexNumber result = client.Add(value1, value2);  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Add({0} + {1}i, {2} + {3}i) = {4} + {5}i\",  \n    value1.real, value1.imaginary, value2.real, value2.imaginary,  \n    result.real, result.imaginary);  \nif (result is ComplexNumberWithMagnitude)  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Magnitude: {0}\",   \n        ((ComplexNumberWithMagnitude)result).Magnitude);  \n}  \nelse  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"No magnitude was sent from the service\");  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n When you run the sample, the requests and responses of the operation are displayed in the client console window. Note that a magnitude is printed for addition and subtraction but not for multiplication and division because of the way the service was implemented. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \nAdd(1 + 2i, 3 + 4i) = 4 + 6i  \nMagnitude: 7.21110255092798  \nSubtract(1 + 2i, 3 + 4i) = -2 + -2i  \nMagnitude: 2.82842712474619  \nMultiply(2 + 3i, 4 + 7i) = -13 + 26i  \nNo magnitude was sent from the service  \nDivide(3 + 7i, 5 + -2i) = 0.0344827586206897 + 41i  \nNo magnitude was sent from the service  \n  \n    Press <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.
