Constant values are directly converted to constant command tree expressions, without any translation on the client. This includes expressions that result in a constant value. Therefore, data source behavior should be expected for all expressions involving constants. This can result in behavior that differs from CLR behavior.  \n  \n The following example shows a constant expression that is evaluated on the server.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/CS/Program.cs#constantexpression)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E Conceptual Examples#ConstantExpression](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DP L2E Conceptual Examples/VB/Module1.vb#constantexpression)]  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)] does not support using a user class as a constant. However, a property reference on a user class is considered a constant, and will be converted to a command tree constant expression and executed on the data source.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,138],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Constant Expressions\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: 9d98a7be-b110-4edb-8eba-bed10f250b6d","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"Constant Expressions","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[145,165],"content":"Constant Expressions","linkify":"Constant Expressions","nodes":[{"content":"Constant Expressions","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"A constant expression consists of a constant value.","pos":[166,217]},{"content":"Constant values are directly converted to constant command tree expressions, without any translation on the client.","pos":[218,333]},{"content":"This includes expressions that result in a constant value.","pos":[334,392]},{"content":"Therefore, data source behavior should be expected for all expressions involving constants.","pos":[393,484]},{"content":"This can result in behavior that differs from CLR behavior.","pos":[485,544]},{"content":"The following example shows a constant expression that is evaluated on the server.","pos":[551,633]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)]</ph> does not support using a user class as a constant.","pos":[1012,1136],"source":"[!INCLUDE[linq_entities](../../../../../../includes/linq-entities-md.md)] does not support using a user class as a constant."},{"content":"However, a property reference on a user class is considered a constant, and will be converted to a command tree constant expression and executed on the data source.","pos":[1137,1301]},{"pos":[1310,1318],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1322,1474],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)</ept>","source":"[Expressions in LINQ to Entities Queries](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/expressions-in-linq-to-entities-queries.md)"}]}
