Check the path and the spelling of the file name.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Do not rely on the name of a file to determine the contents of the file. For example, the file `myFile.cs` might not be a C# source file.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,330],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Read From a Text File -
