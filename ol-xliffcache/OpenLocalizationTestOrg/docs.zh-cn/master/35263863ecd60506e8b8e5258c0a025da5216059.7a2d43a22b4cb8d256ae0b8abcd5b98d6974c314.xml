This topic demonstrates how to create an activity that writes two messages to the console.  \n  \n### To create a custom Activity using the activity designer  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Select File, New, Project. Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node. Select **Activity Library** in the **Templates** window. Name the new project HelloActivity.  \n  \n3.  Open the new activity.  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface.  \n  \n4.  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity. Enter `\"Hello World\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field.  \n  \n5.  Drag a second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, below the first one. Enter `\"Goodbye\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,81],"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,69]}]},{"pos":[346,398],"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","linkify":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","nodes":[{"content":"Workflow Activity Authoring Using the Activity Class","pos":[0,52]}]},{"content":"The most basic way to create an activity using <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)]</ph> in <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)]</ph> is to create a class that inherits from <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Activity&gt;</ph> that creates functionality by assembling custom activities or activities from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Built-In Activity Library<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/net-framework-4-5-built-in-activity-library.md)</ept>.","pos":[399,851],"source":"The most basic way to create an activity using [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../includes/wf-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] is to create a class that inherits from <xref:System.Activities.Activity> that creates functionality by assembling custom activities or activities from the [Built-In Activity Library](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/net-framework-4-5-built-in-activity-library.md)."},{"content":"This topic demonstrates how to create an activity that writes two messages to the console.","pos":[852,942]},{"pos":[952,1007],"content":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","linkify":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","nodes":[{"content":"To create a custom Activity using the activity designer","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[1017,1091],"content":"Open <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)]</ph>.","source":"Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)]."},{"content":"Select File, New, Project.","pos":[1101,1127]},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Workflow 4.0<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> under <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Visual C#<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> in the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Project Types<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> window, and select the <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>v2010<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept> node.","pos":[1128,1235],"source":" Select **Workflow 4.0** under **Visual C#** in the **Project Types** window, and select the **v2010** node."},{"content":"Select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Activity Library<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Templates<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> window.","pos":[1236,1292],"source":" Select **Activity Library** in the **Templates** window."},{"content":"Name the new project HelloActivity.","pos":[1293,1328]},{"content":"Open the new activity.","pos":[1338,1360]},{"content":"Drag a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface.","pos":[1362,1466],"source":"  Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity from the toolbox onto the designer surface."},{"content":"Drag a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine&gt;</ph> activity into the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity.","pos":[1476,1601],"source":"Drag a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity."},{"content":"Enter <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"Hello World\"`</ph> (with quotes) into the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field.","pos":[1602,1662],"source":" Enter `\"Hello World\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field."},{"content":"Drag a second <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine&gt;</ph> activity into the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph> activity, below the first one.","pos":[1672,1825],"source":"Drag a second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, below the first one."},{"content":"Enter <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"Goodbye\"`</ph> (with quotes) into the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field.","pos":[1826,1882],"source":" Enter `\"Goodbye\"` (with quotes) into the **Text** field."}]}
