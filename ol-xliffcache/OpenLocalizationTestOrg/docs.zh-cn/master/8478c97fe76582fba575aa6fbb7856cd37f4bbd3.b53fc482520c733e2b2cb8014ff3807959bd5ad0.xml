If an application needs to create a file, that application needs `Create` access for the folder. If the file already exists, the application needs only `Write` access, a lesser privilege. Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant `Read` access to a single file, rather than `Create` access for a folder.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.OpenTextFileWriter%2A>   \n [How to: Read from Text Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-text-files.md)   \n [Writing to Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/writing-to-files.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,670],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Write Text to Files with a StreamWriter in Visual Basic | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
