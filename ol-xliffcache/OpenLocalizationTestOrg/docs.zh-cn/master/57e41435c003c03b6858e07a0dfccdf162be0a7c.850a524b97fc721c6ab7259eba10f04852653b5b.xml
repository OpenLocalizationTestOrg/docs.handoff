The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property sets the background color for controls that are contained in the panel, such as labels and radio buttons. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is not set, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> selection will fill all of the panel. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is set, the image will be displayed behind the controls that are contained in the panel.  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form that contains a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control. For information about how to set up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To set the background in the Windows Forms Designer  \n  \n1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the arrow button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property to display a window with three tabs.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Custom** tab to display a palette of colors.  \n  \n4.  Select the **Web** or **System** tab to display a list of predefined names for colors, and then select a color.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties** window, click the arrow button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property.  \n  \n6.  In the **Open** dialog box, select the file that you want to display.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A>   \n [Panel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [Panel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/group-controls-with-wf-panel-control-using-the-designer.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,99],"content":"How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,87]}]},{"pos":[657,727],"content":"How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer","pos":[0,70]}]},{"content":"A Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control can display both a background color and a background image.","pos":[728,845],"source":"A Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can display both a background color and a background image."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A&gt;</ph> property sets the background color for controls that are contained in the panel, such as labels and radio buttons.","pos":[846,1013],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property sets the background color for controls that are contained in the panel, such as labels and radio buttons."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A&gt;</ph> property is not set, the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A&gt;</ph> selection will fill all of the panel.","pos":[1014,1187],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is not set, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> selection will fill all of the panel."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A&gt;</ph> property is set, the image will be displayed behind the controls that are contained in the panel.","pos":[1188,1347],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> property is set, the image will be displayed behind the controls that are contained in the panel."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form that contains a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1354,1491],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form that contains a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control."},{"content":"For information about how to set up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Application Project<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1492,1795],"source":" For information about how to set up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1803,2179],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
