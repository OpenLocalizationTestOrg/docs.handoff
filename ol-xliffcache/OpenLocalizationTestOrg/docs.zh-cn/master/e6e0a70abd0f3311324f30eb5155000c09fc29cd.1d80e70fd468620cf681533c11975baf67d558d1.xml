When the CLR boxes a value type, it wraps the value inside a System.Object and stores it on the managed heap. Unboxing extracts the value type from the object. Boxing is implicit; unboxing is explicit. The concept of boxing and unboxing underlies the C# unified view of the type system in which a value of any type can be treated as an object.  \n  \n In the following example, the integer variable `i` is *boxed* and assigned to object `o`.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#14](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_1.cs)]  \n  \n The object `o` can then be unboxed and assigned to integer variable `i`:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#15](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_2.cs)]  \n  \n The following examples illustrate how boxing is used in C#.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#47](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_3.cs)]  \n  \n## Performance  \n In relation to simple assignments, boxing and unboxing are computationally expensive processes. When a value type is boxed, a new object must be allocated and constructed. To a lesser degree, the cast required for unboxing is also expensive computationally. For more information, see [Performance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173196(VS.110).aspx).  \n  \n## Boxing  \n Boxing is used to store value types in the garbage-collected heap. Boxing is an implicit conversion of a [value type](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/value-types.md) to the type `object` or to any interface type implemented by this value type. Boxing a value type allocates an object instance on the heap and copies the value into the new object.  \n  \n Consider the following declaration of a value-type variable:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#17](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_4.cs)]  \n  \n The following statement implicitly applies the boxing operation on the variable `i`:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#18](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_5.cs)]  \n  \n The result of this statement is creating an object reference `o`, on the stack, that references a value of the type `int`, on the heap. This value is a copy of the value-type value assigned to the variable `i`. The difference between the two variables, `i` and `o`, is illustrated in the following figure.  \n  \n ![BoxingConversion graphic](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/media/vcboxingconversion.gif \"vcBoxingConversion\")  \nBoxing Conversion  \n  \n It is also possible to perform the boxing explicitly as in the following example, but explicit boxing is never required:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#19](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_6.cs)]  \n  \n## Description  \n This example converts an integer variable `i` to an object `o` by using boxing. Then, the value stored in the variable `i` is changed from `123` to `456`. The example shows that the original value type and the boxed object use separate memory locations, and therefore can store different values.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#16](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_7.cs)]  \n  \n## Unboxing  \n Unboxing is an explicit conversion from the type `object` to a [value type](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/value-types.md) or from an interface type to a value type that implements the interface. An unboxing operation consists of:  \n  \n-   Checking the object instance to make sure that it is a boxed value of the given value type.  \n  \n-   Copying the value from the instance into the value-type variable.  \n  \n The following statements demonstrate both boxing and unboxing operations:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#21](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_8.cs)]  \n  \n The following figure demonstrates the result of the previous statements.  \n  \n ![UnBoxing Conversion graphic](../../../csharp/programming-guide/types/media/vcunboxingconversion.gif \"vcUnBoxingConversion\")  \nUnboxing Conversion  \n  \n For the unboxing of value types to succeed at run time, the item being unboxed must be a reference to an object that was previously created by boxing an instance of that value type. Attempting to unbox `null` causes a <xref:System.NullReferenceException>. Attempting to unbox a reference to an incompatible value type causes an <xref:System.InvalidCastException>.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates a case of invalid unboxing and the resulting `InvalidCastException`. Using `try` and `catch`, an error message is displayed when the error occurs.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideTypes#20](../../../csharp/programming-guide/nullable-types/codesnippet/CSharp/boxing-and-unboxing_9.cs)]  \n  \n This program outputs:  \n  \n `Specified cast is not valid. Error: Incorrect unboxing.`  \n  \n If you change the statement:  \n  \n```  \nint j = (short) o;  \n```  \n  \n to:  \n  \n```  \nint j = (int) o;  \n```  \n  \n the conversion will be performed, and you will get the output:  \n  \n `Unboxing OK.`  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n##
