configuring security for service behaviors.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Service Auditing Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-auditing-behavior.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> to enable auditing of security events during service operations.  \n  \n [Membership and Role Provider](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/membership-and-role-provider.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how a service can use the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] membership and role providers to authenticate and authorize clients.  \n  \n [Authorizing Access to Service Operations](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/authorizing-access-to-service-operations.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to use the [\\<serviceAuthorization>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/serviceauthorization-element.md) to enable use of the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermissionAttribute> attribute to authorize access to service operations.  \n  \n [Impersonating the Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/impersonating-the-client.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to impersonate the caller application at the service so that the service can access system resources on behalf of the caller.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,101],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Behavior Security\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
