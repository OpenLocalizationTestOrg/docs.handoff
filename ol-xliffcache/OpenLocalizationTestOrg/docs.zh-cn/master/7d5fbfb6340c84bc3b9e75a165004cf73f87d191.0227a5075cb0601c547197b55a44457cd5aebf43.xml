To do this, text such as titles, captions, list box items and so forth have to be translated. To make translation easier the items to be translated are collected into resource files. See              [Localize an Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-localize-an-application.md) for information on how to create a resource file for localization. To make a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly. The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] to load. One of the files required for a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application is a project file (.proj). All resources that you use in your application should be included in the project file. The following code example shows this.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]  \n  \n `<Resource Include=\"data\\picture1.jpg\"/>`  \n  \n `<EmbeddedResource Include=\"data\\stringtable.en-US.restext\"/>`  \n  \n To use a resource in your application, you instantiate                      <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> and load the resource you want to use. The following demonstrates how to do this.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LocalizationResources#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationResources/CSharp/page1.xaml.cs#2)]","nodes":[{"pos":[12,78],"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]},{"pos":[471,520],"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","linkify":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"Localization means to adapt a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> to different cultures.","pos":[521,654],"source":"Localization means to adapt a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to different cultures."},{"content":"To do this, text such as titles, captions, list box items and so forth have to be translated.","pos":[655,748]},{"content":"To make translation easier the items to be translated are collected into resource files.","pos":[749,837]},{"content":"See              <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Localize an Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-localize-an-application.md)</ept> for information on how to create a resource file for localization.","pos":[838,1022],"source":" See              [Localize an Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-localize-an-application.md) for information on how to create a resource file for localization."},{"content":"To make a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly.","pos":[1023,1233],"source":" To make a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly."},{"content":"The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)]</ph> to load.","pos":[1234,1429],"source":" The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] to load."},{"content":"One of the files required for a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> application is a project file (.proj).","pos":[1430,1595],"source":" One of the files required for a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application is a project file (.proj)."},{"content":"All resources that you use in your application should be included in the project file.","pos":[1596,1682]},{"content":"The following code example shows this.","pos":[1683,1721]},{"pos":[1730,1737],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"To use a resource in your application, you instantiate                      <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager&gt;</ph> and load the resource you want to use.","pos":[1936,2090],"source":"To use a resource in your application, you instantiate                      <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> and load the resource you want to use."},{"content":"The following demonstrates how to do this.","pos":[2091,2133]},{"pos":[2140,2277],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>LocalizationResources#2<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationResources/CSharp/page1.xaml.cs#2)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[LocalizationResources#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationResources/CSharp/page1.xaml.cs#2)]"}]}
