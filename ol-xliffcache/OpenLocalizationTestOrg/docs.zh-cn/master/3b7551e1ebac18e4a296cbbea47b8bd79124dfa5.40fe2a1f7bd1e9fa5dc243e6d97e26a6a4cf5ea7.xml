For example, the Arial font family contains the following fonts:  \n  \n-   Arial Regular  \n  \n-   Arial Bold  \n  \n-   Arial Italic  \n  \n-   Arial Bold Italic  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] uses four styles to form families: regular, bold, italic, and bold italic. Adjectives such as *narrow* and *rounded* are not considered styles; rather they are part of the family name. For example, Arial Narrow is a font family with the following members:  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Regular  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Bold  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Italic  \n  \n-   Arial Narrow Bold Italic  \n  \n Before you can draw text with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you need to construct a <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object and a <xref:System.Drawing.Font> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object specifies the typeface (for example, Arial), and the <xref:System.Drawing.Font> object specifies the size, style, and units.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs a regular style Arial font with a size of 16 pixels. In the following code, the first argument passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Font.%23ctor%2A> constructor is the <xref:System.Drawing.FontFamily> object. The second argument specifies the size of the font measured in units identified by the fourth argument. The third argument identifies the style.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.GraphicsUnit> is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.GraphicsUnit> enumeration, and <xref:System.Drawing.FontStyle> is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.FontStyle> enumeration.  \n  \n
