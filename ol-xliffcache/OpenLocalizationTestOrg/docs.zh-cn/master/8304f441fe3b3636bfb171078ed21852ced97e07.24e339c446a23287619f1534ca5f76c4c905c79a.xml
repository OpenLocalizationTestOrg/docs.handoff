Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A host can control all code access to thread tokens by both the CLR and user code. It can also ensure that complete security context information is passed across asynchronous operations or code points with restricted code access. `IHostSecurityContext` encapsulates this security context information, which is opaque to the CLR. The CLR captures this information and moves it across thread pool worker item dispatch, finalizer execution, and module and class construction.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
