They also include differences in behavior between applications that run on different .NET Framework runtime environments. The .NET Framework 4.6.2 includes changes in the following areas:\n\n- [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](#WPF)\n\nThe Scope column in the following tables specifies the significance of each change:\n\n- Major. A significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code. Note that none of the retargeting changes fall into this category.\n\n- Minor. A change that either affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.\n\n- Edge. A change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.\n\n- Transparent. A change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user. The app should not require modification because of this change.\n\n## <a name=\"WPF\" /> Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)\n\n<xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridCellsPanel.BringIndexIntoView(System.Int32)>\n\n| Feature | Change | Impact | Scope |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridCellsPanel.BringIndexIntoView%2A> method | In the .NET Framework 4.6.2, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGridCellsPanel.BringIndexIntoView%2A> method executes asynchronously when column virtualization is enabled but the column widths have not been determined.
