Endpoints provide clients access to the functionality offered by a WCF service.  \n  \n Each endpoint consists of four properties:  \n  \n-   An address that indicates where the endpoint can be found.  \n  \n-   A binding that specifies how a client can communicate with the endpoint.  \n  \n-   A contract that identifies the operations available.  \n  \n-   A set of behaviors that specify local implementation details of the endpoint.  \n  \n This topic discusses this endpoint structure and explains how it is represented in the WCF object model.  \n  \n## The Structure of an Endpoint  \n Each endpoint consists of the following:  \n  \n-   Address: The address uniquely identifies the endpoint and tells potential consumers of the service where it is located. It is represented in the WCF object model by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> class. An <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> class contains:  \n  \n    -   A <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress.Uri%2A> property, which represents the address of the service.  \n  \n    -   An <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress.Identity%2A> property, which represents the security identity of the service and a collection of optional message headers. The optional message headers are used to provide additional and more detailed addressing information to identify or interact with the endpoint.  \n  \n     For more information, see [Specifying an Endpoint Address](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-an-endpoint-address.md).  \n  \n-   Binding: The binding specifies how to communicate with the endpoint. This includes:  \n  \n    -   The transport protocol to use (for example, TCP or HTTP).  \n  \n    -   The encoding to use for the messages (for example, text or binary).  \n  \n    -   The necessary security requirements (for example, SSL or SOAP message security).  \n  \n     For more information, see [WCF Bindings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/bindings-overview.md). A binding is represented in the WCF object model by the abstract base class <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding>. For most scenarios, users can use one of the system-provided bindings. For more information, see [System-Provided Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md).  \n  \n-   Contracts: The contract outlines what functionality the endpoint exposes to the client. A contract specifies:  \n  \n    -   What operations can be called by a client.  \n  \n    -   The form of the message.  \n  \n    -   The type of input parameters or data required to call the operation.  \n  \n    -   What type of processing or response message the client can expect.  \n  \n     For more information about defining a contract, see [Designing Service Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-service-contracts.md).  \n  \n-   Behaviors: You can use endpoint behaviors to customize the local behavior of the service endpoint. Endpoint behaviors achieve this by participating in the process of building a WCFruntime. An example of an endpoint behavior is the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint.ListenUri%2A> property, which allows you to specify a different listening address than the SOAP or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) address. For more information, see [ClientViaBehavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/wmi/clientviabehavior.md).  \n  \n## Defining Endpoints  \n You can specify the endpoint for a service either imperatively using code or declaratively through configuration. For more information, see [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-configuration.md) and [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-code.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n This section explains the purpose of bindings, endpoints, and addresses; shows how to configure a binding and an endpoint; and demonstrates how to use the `ClientVia` behavior and `ListenUri` property.  \n  \n [Addresses](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/endpoint-addresses.md)  \n Describes how endpoints are addressed in WCF.  \n  \n [Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/bindings.md)  \n Describes how bindings are used to specify the transport, encoding, and protocol details required for clients and services to communicate with each other.  \n  \n [Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/contracts.md)  \n Describes how contracts define the methods of a service.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-configuration.md)  \n Describes how to create a service endpoint in configuration.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Service Endpoint in Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-service-endpoint-in-code.md)  \n Describes how to create a service endpoint in code.  \n  \n [How to: Use Svcutil.exe to Validate Compiled Service Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-svcutil-exe-to-validate-compiled-service-code.md)  \n Describes how to detect errors in service implementations and configurations without hosting the service using the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Configuring
