In [!INCLUDE[vbprvblong](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/includes/vbprvblong_md.md)], these restrictions have been relaxed, giving you greater freedom in writing and arranging your code.  \n  \n Physical limits are dependent more on run-time memory than on compile-time considerations. If you use prudent programming practices, and divide large applications into multiple classes and modules, then there is very little chance of encountering an internal [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] limitation.  \n  \n The following are some limitations that you might encounter in extreme cases:  \n  \n-   **Name Length.** There is a maximum number of characters for the name of every declared programming element. This maximum applies to an entire qualification string if the element name is qualified. See [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md).  \n  \n-   **Line Length.** There is a maximum of 65535 characters in a physical line of source code. The logical source code line can be longer if you use line continuation characters. See [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md).  \n  \n-   **Array Dimensions.** There is a maximum number of dimensions you can declare for an array. This limits how many indexes you can use to specify an array element. See [Array Dimensions in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/array-dimensions.md).  \n  \n-   **String Length.** There is a maximum number of Unicode characters you can store in a single string. See [String Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/string-data-type.md).  \n  \n-   **Environment String Length.** There is a maximum of 32768 characters for any environment string used as a command-line argument. This is a limitation on all platforms.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Program Structure and Code
