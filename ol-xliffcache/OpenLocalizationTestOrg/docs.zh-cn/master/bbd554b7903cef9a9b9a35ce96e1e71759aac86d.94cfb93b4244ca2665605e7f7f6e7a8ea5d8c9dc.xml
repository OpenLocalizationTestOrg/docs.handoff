Contention occurs when a thread is waiting for a lock while another thread possesses the lock.  \n  \n The following table shows the keyword under which contention events are raised, and the level of the events. (For more information, see [CLR ETW Keywords and Levels](../../../docs/framework/performance/clr-etw-keywords-and-levels.md).)  \n  \n|Keyword for raising the event|Level|  \n|-----------------------------------|-----------|  \n|`ContentionKeyword` (0x4000)|Informational (4)|  \n  \n The following table shows event information.  \n  \n|Event|Event ID|Raised when|  \n|-----------|--------------|-----------------|  \n|`ContentionStart_V1`|81|Contention starts.
