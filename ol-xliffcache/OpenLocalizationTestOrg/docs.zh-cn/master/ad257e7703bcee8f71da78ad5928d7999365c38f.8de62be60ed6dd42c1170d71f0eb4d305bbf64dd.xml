To do this, text such as titles, captions, list box items and so forth have to be translated. To make translation easier the items to be translated are collected into resource files. See [Localize an Application](how-to-localize-an-application.md) for information on how to create a resource file for localization. To make a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly. The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] to load. One of the files required for a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application is a project file (.proj). All resources that you use in your application should be included in the project file. The following code example shows this.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]  \n  \n `<Resource Include=\"data\\picture1.jpg\"/>`  \n  \n `<EmbeddedResource Include=\"data\\stringtable.en-US.restext\"/>`  \n  \n To use a resource in your application, you instantiate <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> and load the resource you want to use. The following demonstrates how to do this.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LocalizationResources#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationResources/CSharp/page1.xaml.cs#2)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,230],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"applications [WPF], localizable\"\n  - \"localizable applications [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: 08539ad6-7fca-4f34-b82b-ff439e11dfa7","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","pos":[0,49]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[237,286],"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","linkify":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Resources in Localizable Applications","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"Localization means to adapt a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> to different cultures.","pos":[287,407],"source":"Localization means to adapt a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to different cultures."},{"content":"To do this, text such as titles, captions, list box items and so forth have to be translated.","pos":[408,501]},{"content":"To make translation easier the items to be translated are collected into resource files.","pos":[502,590]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Localize an Application<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-localize-an-application.md)</ept> for information on how to create a resource file for localization.","pos":[591,722],"source":" See [Localize an Application](how-to-localize-an-application.md) for information on how to create a resource file for localization."},{"content":"To make a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly.","pos":[723,920],"source":" To make a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application localizable, developers need to build all the localizable resources into a resource assembly."},{"content":"The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)]</ph> to load.","pos":[921,1103],"source":" The resource assembly is localized into different languages, and the code-behind uses resource management [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_api](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-api-md.md)] to load."},{"content":"One of the files required for a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> application is a project file (.proj).","pos":[1104,1256],"source":" One of the files required for a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application is a project file (.proj)."},{"content":"All resources that you use in your application should be included in the project file.","pos":[1257,1343]},{"content":"The following code example shows this.","pos":[1344,1382]},{"pos":[1391,1398],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"To use a resource in your application, you instantiate <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager&gt;</ph> and load the resource you want to use.","pos":[1597,1730],"source":"To use a resource in your application, you instantiate <xref:System.Resources.ResourceManager> and load the resource you want to use."},{"content":"The following demonstrates how to do this.","pos":[1731,1773]}]}
