To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `CopyElementHost`.  \n  \n## Copying a WPF Control  \n After you add a WPF control to the project, you can copy it to other forms in the project.  \n  \n#### To copy a WPF control  \n  \n1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> project to the solution. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n2.  Build the project.  \n  \n3.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n4.  From the **Toolbox**, drag an instance of `UserControl1` onto the form.  \n  \n     An instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  \n  \n5.  With `elementHost1` selected, press CTRL+C to copy it to the clipboard.  \n  \n6.  Add a new Windows Form to the project. Use the default name for the form type, `Form2`.  \n  \n7.  With `Form2` open in the Windows Forms Designer, press CTRL+V to paste a copy of `elementHost1` onto the form.  \n  \n     The copied control is also named `elementHost1`, because it is a private field of the `Form2` class. There is no name collision with the `elementHost1` in the `Form1` class.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>   \n [Migration and Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)   \n [Using WPF Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-wpf-controls.md)   \n [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,112],"content":"Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,100]}]},{"pos":[661,744],"content":"Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms","linkify":"Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms","pos":[0,83]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough shows you how to copy a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control from one Windows Form to another.","pos":[745,865]},{"content":"In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:","pos":[872,925]},{"content":"Create the project.","pos":[935,954]},{"content":"Copy a WPF Control.","pos":[964,983]},{"pos":[991,1367],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
