The easiest to do this is to compose a Language Integrated Query (LINQ) query expression that includes the desired query options. You can also call a series of LINQ query methods to compose an equivalent query. Finally, you can use the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.AddQueryOption%2A> method to add query options to a query. In each of these cases, the URI that is generated by the client includes the requested entity set with the selected query options applied. For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to compose a LINQ query expression that returns only orders with a freight cost of more than $30 and that orders the results by the ship date in descending order.  \n
