The **Service Manager** starts your service by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method to return. If the method does not return in this time, the manager shows an error that the service cannot be started.  \n  \n When you debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method as described in [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md), you must be aware of this 30-second period. If you place a breakpoint in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)\n- [Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,510],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"debugging Windows Service applications\"\n  - \"debugging [Visual Studio], Windows services\"\n  - \"troubleshooting service applications\"\n  - \"services, troubleshooting\"\n  - \"troubleshooting debugging, Windows Services\"\n  - \"Windows Service applications, debugging\"\n  - \"services, debugging\"\n  - \"Windows Service applications, troubleshooting\"\nms.assetid: cf859d4c-f04c-4cb7-81e3-bc7de8bea190\nauthor: \"ghogen\"","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[517,560],"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","linkify":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"When you debug a Windows service application, your service and the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Service Manager<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> interact.","pos":[561,665],"source":"When you debug a Windows service application, your service and the **Windows Service Manager** interact."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Service Manager<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> starts your service by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method to return.","pos":[666,888],"source":" The **Service Manager** starts your service by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method to return."},{"content":"If the method does not return in this time, the manager shows an error that the service cannot be started.","pos":[889,995]},{"content":"When you debug the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method as described in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Debug Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)</ept>, you must be aware of this 30-second period.","pos":[1002,1272],"source":"When you debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method as described in [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md), you must be aware of this 30-second period."},{"content":"If you place a breakpoint in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service.","pos":[1273,1446],"source":" If you place a breakpoint in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service."},{"pos":[1455,1463],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1467,1598],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Debug Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)"},{"pos":[1601,1737],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)</ept>","source":"[Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)"}]}
