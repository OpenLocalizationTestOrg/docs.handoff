The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object represents a [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] drawing surface, and is the object that is used to create graphical images.  \n  \n There are two steps in working with graphics:  \n  \n1.  Creating a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n2.  Using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object to draw lines and shapes, render text, or display and manipulate images.  \n  \n## Creating a Graphics Object  \n A graphics object can be created in a variety of ways.  \n  \n#### To create a graphics object  \n  \n-   Receive a reference to a graphics object as part of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event of a form or control. This is usually how you obtain a reference to a graphics object when creating painting code for a control. Similarly, you can also obtain a graphics object as a property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> when handling the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event for a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> method of a control or form to obtain a reference to a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object that represents the drawing surface of that control or form. Use this method if you want to draw on a form or control that already exists.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Create a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object from any object that inherits from <xref:System.Drawing.Image>. This approach is useful when you want to alter an already existing image.  \n  \n     The following sections give details about each of these processes.  \n  \n## PaintEventArgs in the Paint Event Handler  \n When programming the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler> for controls or the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> for a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>, a graphics object is provided as one of the properties of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> or <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs>.  \n  \n#### To obtain a reference to a Graphics object from the PaintEventArgs in the Paint event  \n  \n1.  Declare the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n2.  Assign the variable to refer to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object passed as part of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>.  \n  \n3.  Insert code to paint the form or control.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to reference a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Form1_Paint(sender As Object, pe As PaintEventArgs) Handles _  \n       MyBase.Paint  \n       ' Declares the Graphics object and sets it to the Graphics object  \n       ' supplied in the PaintEventArgs.  \n       Dim g As Graphics = pe.Graphics  \n       ' Insert code to paint the form here.  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void Form1_Paint(object sender,   \n       System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs pe)   \n    {  \n       // Declares the Graphics object and sets it to the Graphics object  \n       // supplied in the PaintEventArgs.  \n       Graphics g = pe.Graphics;  \n       // Insert code to paint the form here.  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void Form1_Paint(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Windows::Forms::PaintEventArgs ^ pe)  \n       {  \n          // Declares the Graphics object and sets it to the Graphics object  \n          // supplied in the PaintEventArgs.  \n          Graphics ^ g = pe->Graphics;  \n          // Insert code to paint the form here.  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n## CreateGraphics Method  \n You can also use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> method of a control or form to obtain a reference to a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object that represents the drawing surface of that control or form.  \n  \n#### To create a Graphics object with the CreateGraphics method  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.CreateGraphics%2A> method of the form or control upon which you want to render graphics.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim g as Graphics  \n    ' Sets g to a Graphics object representing the drawing surface of the  \n    ' control or form g is a member of.  \n    g = Me.CreateGraphics  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    Graphics g;  \n    // Sets g to a graphics object representing the drawing surface of the  \n    // control or form g is a member of.  \n    g = this.CreateGraphics();  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    Graphics ^ g;  \n    // Sets g to a graphics object representing the drawing surface of the  \n    // control or form g is a member of.  \n    g = this->CreateGraphics();  \n    ```  \n  \n## Create from an Image Object  \n Additionally, you can create a graphics object from any object that derives from the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class.  \n  \n#### To create a Graphics object from an Image  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FromImage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, supplying the name of the Image variable from which you want to create a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim myBitmap as New Bitmap(\"C:\\Documents and Settings\\Joe\\Pics\\myPic.bmp\")  \n    Dim g as Graphics = Graphics.FromImage(myBitmap)  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    Bitmap myBitmap = new Bitmap(@\"C:\\Documents and   \n       Settings\\Joe\\Pics\\myPic.bmp\");  \n    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(myBitmap);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    Bitmap ^ myBitmap = gcnew  \n       Bitmap(\"D:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\Joe\\\\Pics\\\\myPic.bmp\");  \n    Graphics ^ g = Graphics::FromImage(myBitmap);  \n    ```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can only create <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> objects from nonindexed .bmp files, such as 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit .bmp files. Each pixel of nonindexed .bmp files holds a color, in contrast to pixels of indexed .bmp files, which hold an index to a color table.  \n  \n-  \n  \n## Drawing and Manipulating Shapes and Images  \n After it is created, a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object may be used to draw lines and shapes, render text, or display and manipulate images. The principal objects that are used with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object are:  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class—Used for drawing lines, outlining shapes, or rendering other geometric representations.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Drawing.Brush> class—Used for filling areas of graphics, such as filled shapes, images, or text.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Drawing.Font> class—Provides a description of what shapes to use when rendering text.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Drawing.Color> structure—Represents the different colors to display.  \n  \n#### To use the Graphics object you have created  \n  \n-   Work with the appropriate object listed above to draw what you need.  \n  \n     For more information, see the following topics:  \n  \n    |To render|See|  \n
