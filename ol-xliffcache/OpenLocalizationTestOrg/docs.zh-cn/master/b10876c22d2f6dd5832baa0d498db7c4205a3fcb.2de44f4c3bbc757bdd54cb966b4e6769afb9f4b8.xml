You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a `With`...`End With` block.  \n  \n### To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable  \n  \n1.  Declare a variable of the type of the object that you are accessing frequently. Specify the qualification path in the initialization part of the declaration.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Dim ctrlActv As Control = someForm.ActiveForm.ActiveControl  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Use the variable to access the object's members.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ctrlActv.Text = \"Test\"  \n    ctrlActv.Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n    ctrlActv.Show()  \n    ```  \n  \n### To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block  \n  \n1.  Put the qualification path in a `With` statement.  \n  \n    ```  \n    With someForm.ActiveForm.ActiveControl  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Access the object's members inside the `With` block, before the `End With` statement.  \n  \n    ```  \n        .Text = \"Test\"  \n        .Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n        .Show()  \n    End With  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)\n- [With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,369],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"variables [Visual Basic], accessing\"\n  - \"variables [Visual Basic], object\"\n  - \"With statement [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"With block\"\n  - \"object variables [Visual Basic], accessing\"\nms.assetid: 3eb7657f-c9fe-4e05-8bc3-4bb14d5ae585","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,82],"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,82]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[376,458],"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,82]}]},{"content":"If you frequently access an object that requires a qualification path of several methods and properties, you can speed up your code by not repeating the qualification path.","pos":[459,631]},{"content":"There are two ways you can avoid repeating the qualification path.","pos":[638,704]},{"content":"You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph>...<ph id=\"ph2\">`End With`</ph> block.","pos":[705,795],"source":" You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a `With`...`End With` block."},{"pos":[805,883],"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","linkify":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","nodes":[{"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","pos":[0,78]}]},{"content":"Declare a variable of the type of the object that you are accessing frequently.","pos":[893,972]},{"content":"Specify the qualification path in the initialization part of the declaration.","pos":[973,1050]},{"content":"Use the variable to access the object's members.","pos":[1149,1197]},{"pos":[1327,1408],"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","linkify":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","nodes":[{"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","pos":[0,81]}]},{"pos":[1418,1467],"content":"Put the qualification path in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> statement.","source":"Put the qualification path in a `With` statement."},{"pos":[1545,1630],"content":"Access the object's members inside the <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block, before the <ph id=\"ph2\">`End With`</ph> statement.","source":"Access the object's members inside the `With` block, before the `End With` statement."},{"pos":[1762,1770],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1774,1884],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Object Variables<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)</ept>","source":"[Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)"},{"pos":[1887,1997],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>With...End With Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)"}]}
