This method takes two parameters: a <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty> that specifies the property to animate, and the animation to apply to that property.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to animate the width and background color of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[animateproperty#11](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/animateproperty/CPP/LocalAnimationExample.cpp#11)]\n [!code-csharp[animateproperty#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/animateproperty/CSharp/LocalAnimationExample.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[animateproperty#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/animateproperty/VisualBasic/LocalAnimationExample.vb#11)]  \n  \n A variety of animation classes in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation> namespace exist for animating different types of properties.
