For example, a common type of credential is the X.509 certificate, which you create with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateInitiatorClientCredential.SetCertificate%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. \n\nThere are three different types of certificate stores that you can examine with the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) on Windows systems:\n\n- Local computer: The store is local to the device and global to all users on the device.\n\n- Current user: The store is local to the current user account on the device.\n\n- Service account: The store is local to a particular service on the device.\n\n## View certificates in the MMC snap-in \n\nThe following procedure demonstrates how to examine the stores on your local device to find an appropriate certificate: \n  \n1. Select **Run** from the **Start** menu, and then enter *mmc*. \n\n    The MMC appears. \n  \n2. From the **File** menu, select **Add/Remove Snap In**. \n    \n    The **Add or Remove Snap-ins** window appears.\n  \n3. From the **Available snap-ins** list, choose **Certificates**, then select **Add**.  \n\n    ![Add certificate snap-in](./media/mmc-add-certificate-snap-in.png)\n  \n4. In the **Certificates snap-in** window, select **Computer account**, and then select **Next**. \n  \n    Optionally, you can select **My user account** for the current user or **Service account** for a particular service. \n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If you're not an administrator for your device, you can manage certificates only for your user account.\n  \n5. In the **Select Computer** window, leave **Local computer** selected, and then select **Finish**.  \n  \n6. In the **Add or Remove Snap-in** window, select **OK**.  \n  \n    ![Add certificate snap-in](./media/mmc-certificate-snap-in-selected.png)\n\n7. Optional: From the **File** menu, select **Save** or **Save As** to save the MMC console file for later use.  \n\n8. To view your certificates in the MMC snap-in, select **Console Root** in the left pane, then expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**.\n\n    A list of directories for each type of certificate appears. From each certificate directory, you can view, export, import, and delete its certificates.\n\n## View certificates with the Certificate Manager tool\n\nYou can also view, export, import, and delete certificates by using the Certificate Manager tool.\n\n### To view certificates for the local device\n\n1. Select **Run** from the **Start** menu, and then enter *certlm.msc*. \n\n    The Certificate Manager tool for the local device appears. \n  \n2. To view your certificates, under **Certificates - Local Computer** in the left pane, expand the directory for the type of certificate you want to view.\n\n### To view certificates for the current user\n\n1. Select **Run** from the **Start** menu, and then enter *certmgr.msc*. \n\n    The Certificate Manager tool for the current user appears. \n  \n2. To view your certificates, under **Certificates - Current User** in the left pane, expand the directory for the type of certificate you want to view.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Working with
