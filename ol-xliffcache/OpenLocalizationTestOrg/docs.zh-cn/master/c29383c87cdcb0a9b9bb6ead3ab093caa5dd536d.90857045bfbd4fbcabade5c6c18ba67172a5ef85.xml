For more information about these scenarios, see [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment).  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT ExecuteApplication(  \n    [in] LPCWSTR   pwzAppFullName,  \n    [in] DWORD     dwManifestPaths,  \n    [in] LPCWSTR   *ppwzManifestPaths,  \n    [in] DWORD     dwActivationData,  \n    [in] LPCWSTR   *ppwzActivationData,  \n    [out] int      *pReturnValue  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `pwzAppFullName`  \n [in] The full name of the application, as defined for <xref:System.ApplicationIdentity>.  \n  \n `dwManifestPaths`  \n [in] The number of strings contained in the `ppwzManifestPaths` array.  \n  \n `ppwzManifestPaths`  \n [in] Optional. A string array that contains manifest paths for the application.  \n  \n `dwActivationData`  \n [in] The number of strings contained in the `ppwzActivationData` array.  \n  \n `ppwzActivationData`  \n [in] Optional. A string array that contains the application's activation data, such as the query string portion of the URL for applications deployed over the Web.  \n  \n `pReturnValue`  \n [out] The value returned from the entry point of the application.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`ExecuteApplication` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `ExecuteApplication` is used to activate ClickOnce applications in a newly created application domain.  \n  \n The `pReturnValue` output parameter is set to the value returned by the application. If you supply a value of null for `pReturnValue`, `ExecuteApplication` does not fail, but it does not return a value.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Do not call the [Start Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-start-method.md) method before calling the `ExecuteApplication` method to activate a manifest-based application. If the `Start` method is called first, the `ExecuteApplication` method call will fail.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework
