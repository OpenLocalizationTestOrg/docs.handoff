This applies not only to the members but also to the implementation, inheritance, and access level.  \n  \n A class cannot be both *abstract* and *sealed*, meaning it cannot both require and forbid inheritance. Therefore you cannot specify both `MustInherit` and `NotInheritable` for the same class.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30926  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Decide whether the class should require inheritance, forbid inheritance, or neither, and remove the keywords that are inappropriate to your decision.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Partial](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/partial.md)\n- [MustInherit](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustinherit.md)\n- [NotInheritable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/notinheritable.md)\n- [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,328],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'MustInherit' cannot be specified for partial type '<partialtypename>' because it cannot be combined with 'NotInheritable' specified for one of its other partial types\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
