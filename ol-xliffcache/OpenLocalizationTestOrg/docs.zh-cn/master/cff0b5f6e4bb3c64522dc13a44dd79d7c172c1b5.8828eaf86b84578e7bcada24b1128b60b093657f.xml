For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n Unless you have a very specific reason for querying using XPath, such as extensive use of legacy code, using XPath with LINQ to XML is not recommended. XPath queries will not perform as well as [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] queries.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A> to select a set of elements.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim root As XElement = _  \n    <Root>  \n        <Child1>1</Child1>  \n        <Child1>2</Child1>  \n        <Child1>3</Child1>  \n        <Child2>4</Child2>  \n        <Child2>5</Child2>  \n        <Child2>6</Child2>  \n    </Root>  \n  \nDim list As IEnumerable(Of XElement) = root.XPathSelectElements(\"./Child2\")  \nFor Each el As XElement In list  \n    Console.WriteLine(el)  \nNext  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Child2>4</Child2>  \n<Child2>5</Child2>  \n<Child2>6</Child2>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,134],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: e1f69a20-1efa-452d-9089-c472fa84b3d5","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,52],"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,52]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[141,193],"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,52]}]},{"content":"This topic introduces the extension methods that enable you to query an XML tree by using XPath.","pos":[194,290]},{"content":"For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>.","pos":[291,421],"source":" For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=nameWithType>."},{"content":"Unless you have a very specific reason for querying using XPath, such as extensive use of legacy code, using XPath with LINQ to XML is not recommended.","pos":[428,579]},{"content":"XPath queries will not perform as well as <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)]</ph> queries.","pos":[580,684],"source":" XPath queries will not perform as well as [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] queries."},{"pos":[693,700],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[704,846],"content":"The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A&gt;</ph> to select a set of elements.","source":"The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A> to select a set of elements."},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[1248,1291]},{"pos":[1381,1389],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1393,1548],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)"}]}
