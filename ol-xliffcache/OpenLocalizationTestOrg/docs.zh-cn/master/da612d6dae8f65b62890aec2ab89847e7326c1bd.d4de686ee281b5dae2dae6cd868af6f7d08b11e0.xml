Any numeric expression.  \n  \n `expression2`  \n Required unless the `–` operator is calculating a negative value. Any numeric expression.  \n  \n## Result  \n The result is the difference between `expression1` and `expression2`, or the negated value of `expression1`.  \n  \n The result data type is a numeric type appropriate for the data types of `expression1` and `expression2`. See the \"Integer Arithmetic\" tables in [Data Types of Operator Results](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/data-types-of-operator-results.md).  \n  \n## Supported Types  \n All numeric types. This includes the unsigned and floating-point types and `Decimal`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n In the first usage shown in the syntax shown previously, the `–` operator is the *binary* arithmetic subtraction operator for the difference between two numeric expressions.  \n  \n In the second usage shown in the syntax shown previously, the `–` operator is the *unary* negation operator for the negative value of an expression. In this sense, the negation consists of reversing the sign of `expression1` so that the result is positive if `expression1` is negative.  \n  \n If either expression evaluates to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md), the `–` operator treats it as zero.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `–` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, make sure that you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `–` operator to calculate and return the difference between two numbers, and then to negate a number.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#10](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/subtraction-operator_1.vb)]  \n  \n Following the execution of these statements, `binaryResult` contains 124.45 and `unaryResult` contains –334.90.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [-= Operator (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/subtraction-assignment-operator.md)\n [Arithmetic Operators](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/arithmetic-operators.md)   \n [Operator Precedence in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/operator-precedence.md)   \n [Operators Listed by Functionality](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/operators-listed-by-functionality.md)   \n [Arithmetic Operators in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/arithmetic-operators.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,955],"nodes":[{"content":"- Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[2,42],"content":"Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]}],"pos":[6,51],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"- Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
