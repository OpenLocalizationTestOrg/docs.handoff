By changing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> property, you can control the resizing behavior of the form. In addition, setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> affects how the caption bar is displayed as well as what buttons might appear on it. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle>.  \n  \n There is extensive support for this task in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)].  \n  \n See also [How to: Change the Borders of Windows Forms Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/yettzh3e\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n### To set the border style of Windows Forms programmatically  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> property to the style you want. The following code example sets the border style of form`DlgBx1` to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    DlgBx1.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    DlgBx1.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    DlgBx1->FormBorderStyle =  \n       System::Windows::Forms::FormBorderStyle::FixedDialog;  \n    ```  \n  \n     Also see [How to: Create Dialog Boxes at Design Time](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/55cz5x2c\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n     Additionally, if you have chosen a border style for the form that provides optional **Minimize** and **Maximize** buttons, you can specify whether you want either or both of these buttons to be functional. These buttons are useful when you want to closely control the user experience. The **Minimize** and **Maximize** buttons are enabled by default, and their functionality is manipulated through the **Properties** window.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
