In the **Toolbox**, click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control icon.  \n  \n     Do not drag the icon onto the form.  \n  \n3.  Move the mouse pointer close to the three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  \n  \n     The pointer changes to a crosshair with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control icon attached.  \n  \n4.  Click and hold the mouse button.  \n  \n5.  Drag the mouse pointer to draw the outline of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n6.  Draw the outline around the three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  \n  \n7.
