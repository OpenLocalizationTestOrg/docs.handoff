This can happen if the process is running on a SQL server using fibers.  \n  \n A fiber consists of a stack and a register context, and it can run on any thread. A fiber can be swapped out of a thread and restarted later on a different thread.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30948  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Make sure that fiber is scheduled on a physical thread.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Transact-SQL Debugger](/sql/ssms/scripting/transact-sql-debugger)\n- [Debugging in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,178],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Unscheduled Fiber\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30948\"\n  - \"vbc30948\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30948\"\nms.assetid: 982bf6d2-ce62-4451-8a23-82dacf8ee100","nodes":[{"content":"Unscheduled Fiber","nodes":[{"pos":[0,17],"content":"Unscheduled Fiber","nodes":[{"content":"Unscheduled Fiber","pos":[0,17]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[185,202],"content":"Unscheduled Fiber","linkify":"Unscheduled Fiber","nodes":[{"content":"Unscheduled Fiber","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"The debugger cannot evaluate an expression because it is in a logical fiber that is not scheduled on a physical thread.","pos":[203,322]},{"content":"This can happen if the process is running on a SQL server using fibers.","pos":[323,394]},{"content":"A fiber consists of a stack and a register context, and it can run on any thread.","pos":[401,482]},{"content":"A fiber can be swapped out of a thread and restarted later on a different thread.","pos":[483,564]},{"pos":[571,592],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30948","source":"**Error ID:** BC30948"},{"pos":[601,622],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Make sure that fiber is scheduled on a physical thread.","pos":[632,687]},{"pos":[696,704],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[708,774],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Transact-SQL Debugger<ept id=\"p1\">](/sql/ssms/scripting/transact-sql-debugger)</ept>","source":"[Transact-SQL Debugger](/sql/ssms/scripting/transact-sql-debugger)"},{"pos":[777,856],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Debugging in Visual Studio<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)</ept>","source":"[Debugging in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)"}]}
