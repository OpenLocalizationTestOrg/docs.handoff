For example, Windows Explorer contains a List control for the current folder content while the view for the control is managed from the Windows Explorer application.  \n  \n-   A control that is able to sort its content is not considered to support multiple views.  \n  \n-   The collection of views must be identical across instances.  \n  \n-   View names must be suitable for use in Text to Speech, Braille, and other human-readable applications.  \n  \n<a name=\"Required_Members_for_IMultipleViewProvider\"></a>   \n## Required Members for IMultipleViewProvider  \n The following properties and methods are required for implementing IMultipleViewProvider.  \n  \n|Required members|Member type|Notes|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.CurrentView%2A>|Property|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetSupportedViews%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A>|Method|None|  \n  \n There are no events associated with this control pattern.  \n  \n<a name=\"Exceptions\"></a>   \n## Exceptions  \n Provider must throw the following exceptions.  \n  \n|Exception type|Condition|  \n|--------------------|---------------|  \n|<xref:System.ArgumentException>|When either <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A> is called with a parameter that is not a member of the supported views collection.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [UI Automation Control Patterns Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-overview.md)   \n [Support Control Patterns in a UI Automation Provider](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/support-control-patterns-in-a-ui-automation-provider.md)   \n [UI Automation Control Patterns for Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-for-clients.md)   \n [UI Automation Tree Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-tree-overview.md)   \n [Use Caching in UI Automation](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-caching-in-ui-automation.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,525],"nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,76]}]}],"pos":[6,85],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-bcl\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"UI Automation, MultipleView control pattern\"\n  - \"MultipleView control pattern\"\n  - \"control patterns, MultipleView\"\nms.assetid: 5bf1b248-ffee-48c8-9613-0b134bbe9f6a\ncaps.latest.revision: 15\nauthor: \"Xansky\"\nms.author: \"mhopkins\"\nmanager: \"markl\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[532,591],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","linkify":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[594,1056],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
