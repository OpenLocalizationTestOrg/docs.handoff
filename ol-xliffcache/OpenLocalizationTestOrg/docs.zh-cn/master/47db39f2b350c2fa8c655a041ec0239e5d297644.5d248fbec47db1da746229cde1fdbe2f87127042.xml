The value must be in the range of 1 to 65535.|Correct the `-port:<portNum>`<br /><br /> command line option as indicated in the error message.|  \n|6|An invalid endpoint certificate was specified on the command line.  The certificate could not be found, or it did not pass verification.|Correct the `-endpointCert` command line option. Ensure that the certificate has a private key, is intended to be used for both ClientAuthentication and ServerAuthentication, is installed in the LocalMachine\\MY certificate store, and is fully trusted.|  \n|7|An invalid accounts certificate was specified on the command line.|Correct the `-accountsCerts` command line option.
