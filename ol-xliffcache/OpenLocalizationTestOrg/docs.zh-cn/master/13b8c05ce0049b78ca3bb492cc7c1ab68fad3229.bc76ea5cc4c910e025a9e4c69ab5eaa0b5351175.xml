Each domain centralizes authentication and authorization in a security token service. When trust is established between two such services, members of each domain can use the services of the other.  \n  \n For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)   \n [Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[374,409],"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","linkify":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","nodes":[{"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[410,533],"content":"The issued token client enables the federated security scenario in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph>.","source":"The issued token client enables the federated security scenario in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]."},{"content":"Federated security enables the establishment of trust between independent domains.","pos":[540,622]},{"content":"Each domain centralizes authentication and authorization in a security token service.","pos":[623,708]},{"content":"When trust is established between two such services, members of each domain can use the services of the other.","pos":[709,819]},{"pos":[826,998],"content":"For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Federation and Issued Tokens<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)</ept>.","source":"For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)."},{"pos":[1007,1015],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Federation and Issued Tokens<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1019,1130],"source":"[Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&amp;clcid=0x409)</ept>","pos":[1133,1239],"source":" [Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)"}]}
