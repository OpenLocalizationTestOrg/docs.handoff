The following example shows the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> as the last element in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.Children%2A> collection of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.  \n  \n [!code-xml[GridSplitterSnips#GridSplitterLastChild](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterSnips/CSharp/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterlastchild)]  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndexProperty> on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> to be higher than a control that would otherwise hide it. The following example gives the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> control a higher <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel.ZIndexProperty> than the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control.  \n  \n [!code-xml[GridSplitterSnips#GridSplitterZIndex](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterSnips/CSharp/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterzindex)]  \n  \n-   Set margins on the control that would otherwise hide the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> so that the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> is exposed. The following example sets margins on a control that would otherwise overlay and hide the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>.  \n  \n
