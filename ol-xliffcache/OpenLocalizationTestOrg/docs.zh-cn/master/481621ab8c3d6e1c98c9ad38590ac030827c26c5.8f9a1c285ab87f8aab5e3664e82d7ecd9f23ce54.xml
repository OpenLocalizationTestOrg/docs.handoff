Associated [catch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md) blocks are used to handle any resulting exceptions. A [finally](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-finally.md) block contains code that is run regardless of whether or not an exception is thrown in the `try` block, such as releasing resources that are allocated in the `try` block. A `try` block requires one or more associated `catch` blocks, or a `finally` block, or both.  \n  \n The following examples show a `try-catch` statement, a `try-finally` statement, and a `try-catch-finally` statement.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#6](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/exception-handling_1.cs)]  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#7](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/exception-handling_2.cs)]  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#8](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/exception-handling_3.cs)]  \n  \n A `try` block without a `catch` or `finally` block causes a compiler error.  \n  \n## Catch Blocks  \n A `catch` block can specify the type of exception to catch. The type specification is called an *exception filter*. The exception type should be derived from <xref:System.Exception>. In general, do not specify <xref:System.Exception> as the exception filter unless either you know how to handle all exceptions that might be thrown in the `try` block, or you have included a [throw](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/throw.md) statement at the end of your `catch` block.  \n  \n Multiple `catch` blocks with different exception filters can be chained together. The `catch` blocks are evaluated from top to bottom in your code, but only one `catch` block is executed for each exception that is thrown. The first `catch` block that specifies the exact type or a base class of the thrown exception is executed. If no `catch` block specifies a matching exception filter, a `catch` block that does not have a filter is selected, if one is present in the statement. It is important to position `catch` blocks with the most specific (that is, the most derived) exception types first.  \n  \n You should catch exceptions when the following conditions are true:  \n  \n-   You have a good understanding of why the exception might be thrown, and you can implement a specific recovery, such as prompting the user to enter a new file name when you catch a <xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> object.  \n  \n-   You can create and throw a new, more specific exception.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#9](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/exception-handling_4.cs)]  \n  \n-   You want to partially handle an exception before passing it on for additional handling. In the following example, a `catch` block is used to add an entry to an error log before re-throwing the exception.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideExceptions#10](../../../csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/codesnippet/CSharp/exception-handling_5.cs)]  \n  \n## Finally Blocks  \n A `finally` block enables you to clean up actions that are performed in a `try` block. If present, the `finally` block executes last, after the `try` block and any matched `catch` block. A `finally` block always runs, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or a `catch` block matching the exception type is found.  \n  \n The `finally` block can be used to release resources such as file streams, database connections, and graphics handles without waiting for the garbage collector in the runtime to finalize the objects. See [using Statement](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement.md) for more information.  \n  \n In the following example, the `finally` block is used to close a file that is opened in the `try` block. Notice that the state of the file handle is checked before the file is closed. If the `try` block cannot open the file, the file handle still has the value `null` and the `finally` block does not try to close it. Alternatively, if the file is opened successfully in the `try` block, the `finally` block closes the open file.  \n  \n
