In this case, the mapping process applies default mapping and creates the following in the <xref:System.Data.DataSet>:  \n  \n-   One table for each of the complex types (parent and child).  \n  \n-   If no unique constraint exists on the parent, one additional primary key column per table definition named *TableName*_Id where *TableName* is the name of the parent table.  \n  \n-   A primary key constraint on the parent table identifying the additional column as the primary key (by setting the **IsPrimaryKey** property to **True**). The constraint is named Constraint\\# where \\# is 1, 2, 3, and so on. For example, the default name for the first constraint is Constraint1.  \n  \n-   A foreign key constraint on the child table identifying the additional column as the foreign key referring to the primary key of the parent table. The constraint is named *ParentTable_ChildTable* where *ParentTable* is the name of the parent table and *ChildTable* is the name of the child table.  \n  \n-   A data relation between the parent and child tables.  \n  \n The following example shows a schema where **OrderDetail** is a child element of **Order**.  \n  \n```xml  \n<xs:schema id=\"MyDataSet\" xmlns=\"\"   \n            xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"   \n            xmlns:msdata=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata\">  \n  \n <xs:element name=\"MyDataSet\" msdata:IsDataSet=\"true\">  \n   <xs:complexType>  \n     <xs:choice maxOccurs=\"unbounded\">  \n       <xs:element name=\"Order\">  \n         <xs:complexType>  \n          <xs:sequence>  \n            <xs:element name=\"OrderNumber\" type=\"xs:string\" />  \n            <xs:element name=\"EmpNumber\" type=\"xs:string\" />  \n            <xs:element name=\"OrderDetail\">  \n              <xs:complexType>  \n                <xs:sequence>  \n                  <xs:element name=\"OrderNo\" type=\"xs:string\" />  \n                  <xs:element name=\"ItemNo\" type=\"xs:string\" />  \n                </xs:sequence>  \n              </xs:complexType>  \n            </xs:element>  \n          </xs:sequence>  \n         </xs:complexType>  \n       </xs:element>  \n     </xs:choice>  \n   </xs:complexType>  \n  </xs:element>  \n</xs:schema>  \n```  \n  \n The XML Schema mapping process creates the following in the **DataSet**:  \n  \n-   An **Order** and an **OrderDetail** table.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Order(OrderNumber, EmpNumber, Order_Id)  \n    OrderDetail(OrderNo, ItemNo, Order_Id)  \n    ```  \n  \n-   A unique constraint on the **Order** table. Note that the **IsPrimaryKey** property is set to **True**.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ConstraintName: Constraint1  \n    Type: UniqueConstraint  \n    Table: Order  \n    Columns: Order_Id   \n    IsPrimaryKey: True  \n    ```  \n  \n-   A foreign key constraint on the **OrderDetail** table.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ConstraintName: Order_OrderDetail  \n    Type: ForeignKeyConstraint  \n    Table: OrderDetail  \n    Columns: Order_Id   \n    RelatedTable: Order  \n    RelatedColumns: Order_Id   \n    ```  \n  \n-   A relationship between the **Order** and **OrderDetail** tables. The **Nested** property for this relationship is set to **True** because the **Order** and **OrderDetail** elements are nested in the schema.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ParentTable: Order  \n    ParentColumns: Order_Id   \n    ChildTable: OrderDetail  \n    ChildColumns: Order_Id   \n    ParentKeyConstraint: Constraint1  \n    ChildKeyConstraint: Order_OrderDetail  \n    RelationName: Order_OrderDetail  \n    Nested: True  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Generating DataSet Relations from XML Schema
