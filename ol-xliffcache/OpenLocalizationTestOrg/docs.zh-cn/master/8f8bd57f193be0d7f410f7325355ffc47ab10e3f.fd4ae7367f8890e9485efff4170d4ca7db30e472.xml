You can optionally acquire the resource with the `Using` statement. When you exit the `Using` block, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] automatically disposes of the resource so that it is available for other code to use. The resource must be local and disposable. For more information, see [Using Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md).  \n  \n## With...End With Construction  \n The `With...End With` construction lets you specify an object reference once and then run a series of statements that access its members. This can simplify your code and improve performance because [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] does not have to re-establish the reference for each statement that accesses it.
