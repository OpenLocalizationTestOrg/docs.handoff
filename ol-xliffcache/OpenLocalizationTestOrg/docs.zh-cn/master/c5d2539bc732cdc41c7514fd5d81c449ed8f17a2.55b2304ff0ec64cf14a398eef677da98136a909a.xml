In this case, the key pair stored in the container is used to sign the file.  \n  \n If `pbKeyBlob` is not null, the key pair is assumed to be contained in the key binary large object (BLOB).  \n  \n `pbKeyBlob`  \n [in] A pointer to the public/private key pair. This pair is in the format created by the Win32 `CryptExportKey` function. If `pbKeyBlob` is null, the key container specified by `wszKeyContainer` is assumed to contain the key pair.  \n  \n `cbKeyBlob`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of `pbKeyBlob`.  \n  \n `ppbSignatureBlob`  \n [out] A pointer to the location to which the common language runtime returns the signature. If `ppbSignatureBlob` is null, the runtime stores the signature in the file specified by `wszFilePath`.  \n  \n If `ppbSignatureBlob` is not null, the common language runtime allocates space in which to return the signature. The caller must free this space using the [ICLRStrongName::StrongNameFreeBuffer](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamefreebuffer-method.md) method.  \n  \n `pcbSignatureBlob`  \n [out] The size, in bytes, of the returned signature.  \n  \n `dwFlags`  \n [in] One or more of the following values:  \n  \n-   `SN_SIGN_ALL_FILES` (0x00000001) - Recompute all hashes for linked modules.  \n  \n-   `SN_TEST_SIGN` (0x00000002) - Test-sign the assembly.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `S_OK` if the method completed successfully; otherwise, an HRESULT value that indicates failure (see [Common HRESULT Values](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=213878) for a list).  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Specify null for `wszFilePath` to calculate the size of the signature without creating the signature.  \n  \n The signature can be either stored directly in the file, or returned to the caller.  \n  \n If `SN_SIGN_ALL_FILES` is specified but a public key is not included (both `pbKeyBlob` and `wszFilePath` are null), hashes for linked modules are recomputed, but the assembly is not re-signed.  \n  \n If `SN_TEST_SIGN` is specified, the common language runtime header is not modified to indicate that the assembly is signed with a strong name.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MetaHost.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v40plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v40plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [StrongNameSignatureGeneration Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamesignaturegeneration-method.md)\n- [ICLRStrongName Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-interface.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,594],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ICLRStrongName::StrongNameSignatureGenerationEx Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  -
