The ability to use the **DataView** to modify data in the underlying table is controlled by setting one of three Boolean properties of the **DataView**. These properties are <xref:System.Data.DataView.AllowNew%2A>, <xref:System.Data.DataView.AllowEdit%2A>, and <xref:System.Data.DataView.AllowDelete%2A>. They are set to **true** by default.  \n  \n If **AllowNew** is **true**, you can use the <xref:System.Data.DataView.AddNew%2A> method of the **DataView** to create a new <xref:System.Data.DataRowView>. Note that a new row is not actually added to the underlying <xref:System.Data.DataTable> until the <xref:System.Data.DataRowView.EndEdit%2A> method of the **DataRowView** is called. If the <xref:System.Data.DataRowView.CancelEdit%2A> method of the **DataRowView** is called, the new row is discarded. Note also that you can edit only one **DataRowView** at a time. If you call the **AddNew** or **BeginEdit** method of the **DataRowView** while a pending row exists, **EndEdit** is implicitly called on the pending row. When **EndEdit** is called, the changes are applied to the underlying **DataTable** and can later be committed or rejected using the **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** methods of the **DataTable**, **DataSet**, or **DataRow** object. If **AllowNew** is **false**, an exception is thrown if you call the **AddNew** method of the **DataRowView**.  \n  \n If **AllowEdit** is **true**, you can modify the contents of a **DataRow** via the **DataRowView**. You can confirm changes to the underlying row using **DataRowView.EndEdit** or reject the changes using **DataRowView.CancelEdit**. Note that only one row can be edited at a time. If you call the **AddNew** or **BeginEdit** methods of the **DataRowView** while a pending row exists, **EndEdit** is implicitly called on the pending row. When **EndEdit** is called, proposed changes are placed in the **Current** row version of the underlying **DataRow** and can later be committed or rejected using the **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** methods of the **DataTable**, **DataSet**, or **DataRow** object. If **AllowEdit** is **false**, an exception is thrown if you attempt to modify a value in the **DataView**.  \n  \n When an existing **DataRowView** is being edited, events of the underlying **DataTable** will still be raised with the proposed changes. Note that if you call **EndEdit** or **CancelEdit** on the underlying **DataRow**, pending changes will be applied or canceled regardless of whether **EndEdit** or **CancelEdit** is called on the **DataRowView**.  \n  \n If **AllowDelete** is **true**, you can delete rows from the **DataView** by using the **Delete** method of the **DataView** or **DataRowView** object, and the rows are deleted from the underlying **DataTable**. You can later commit or reject the deletes using **AcceptChanges** or **RejectChanges** respectively. If **AllowDelete** is **false**, an exception is thrown if you call the **Delete** method of the **DataView** or **DataRowView**.  \n  \n The following code example disables using the **DataView** to delete rows  and adds a new row to the underlying table using the **DataView**.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim custTable As DataTable = custDS.Tables(\"Customers\")  \nDim custView As DataView = custTable.DefaultView  \ncustView.Sort = \"CompanyName\"  \n  \ncustView.AllowDelete = False  \n  \nDim newDRV As DataRowView = custView.AddNew()  \nnewDRV(\"CustomerID\") = \"ABCDE\"  \nnewDRV(\"CompanyName\") = \"ABC Products\"  \nnewDRV.EndEdit()  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataTable custTable = custDS.Tables[\"Customers\"];  \nDataView custView = custTable.DefaultView;  \ncustView.Sort = \"CompanyName\";  \n  \ncustView.AllowDelete = false;  \n  \nDataRowView newDRV = custView.AddNew();  \nnewDRV[\"CustomerID\"] = \"ABCDE\";  \nnewDRV[\"CompanyName\"] = \"ABC Products\";  \nnewDRV.EndEdit();  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Data.DataTable>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataView>   \n <xref:System.Data.DataRowView>   \n
