For example, assume that you are given the following sequence of key-value pairs:  \n  \n|Key|Value|  \n|---------|-----------|  \n|A|We|  \n|A|think|  \n|A|that|  \n|B|Linq|  \n|C|is|  \n|A|really|  \n|B|cool|  \n|B|!|  \n  \n The following groups will be created in this order:  \n  \n1.  We, think, that  \n  \n2.  Linq  \n  \n3.  is  \n  \n4.  really  \n  \n5.  cool, !  \n  \n The solution is implemented as an extension method that is thread-safe and that returns its results in a streaming manner. In other words, it produces its groups as it moves through the source sequence. Unlike the `group` or `orderby` operators, it can begin returning groups to the caller before all of the sequence has been read.  \n  \n Thread-safety is accomplished by making a copy of each group or chunk as the source sequence is iterated, as explained in the source code comments. If the source sequence has a large sequence of contiguous items, the common language runtime may throw an <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows both the extension method and the client code that uses it.  \n  \n [!code-cs[cscsrefContiguousGroups#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-group-results-by-contiguous-keys_1.cs)]  \n  \n To use the extension method in your project, copy the `MyExtensions` static class to a new or existing source code file and if it is required, add a `using` directive for the namespace where it is located.  \n  \n## See also  \n [LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)   \n ","nodes":[{"pos":[12,44],"content":"Group results by contiguous keys","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Group results by contiguous keys","pos":[0,32]}]},{"pos":[59,99],"content":"How to group results by contiguous keys.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to group results by contiguous keys.","pos":[0,40]}]},{"pos":[110,129],"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[353,385],"content":"Group results by contiguous keys","linkify":"Group results by contiguous keys","nodes":[{"content":"Group results by contiguous keys","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to group elements into chunks that represent subsequences of contiguous keys.","pos":[387,496]},{"content":"For example, assume that you are given the following sequence of key-value pairs:","pos":[497,578]},{"content":"Key","pos":[585,588]},{"content":"Value","pos":[589,594]},{"content":"A","pos":[625,626]},{"content":"We","pos":[627,629]},{"content":"A","pos":[634,635]},{"content":"think","pos":[636,641]},{"content":"A","pos":[646,647]},{"content":"that","pos":[648,652]},{"content":"B","pos":[657,658]},{"content":"Linq","pos":[659,663]},{"content":"C","pos":[668,669]},{"content":"is","pos":[670,672]},{"content":"A","pos":[677,678]},{"content":"really","pos":[679,685]},{"content":"B","pos":[690,691]},{"content":"cool","pos":[692,696]},{"content":"B","pos":[701,702]},{"content":"!","pos":[703,704]},{"content":"The following groups will be created in this order:","pos":[712,763]},{"content":"We, think, that","pos":[773,788]},{"content":"Linq","pos":[798,802]},{"content":"is","pos":[812,814]},{"content":"really","pos":[824,830]},{"content":"cool, !","pos":[840,847]},{"content":"The solution is implemented as an extension method that is thread-safe and that returns its results in a streaming manner.","pos":[854,976]},{"content":"In other words, it produces its groups as it moves through the source sequence.","pos":[977,1056]},{"content":"Unlike the <ph id=\"ph1\">`group`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`orderby`</ph> operators, it can begin returning groups to the caller before all of the sequence has been read.","pos":[1057,1185],"source":" Unlike the `group` or `orderby` operators, it can begin returning groups to the caller before all of the sequence has been read."},{"content":"Thread-safety is accomplished by making a copy of each group or chunk as the source sequence is iterated, as explained in the source code comments.","pos":[1192,1339]},{"content":"If the source sequence has a large sequence of contiguous items, the common language runtime may throw an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.OutOfMemoryException&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1340,1481],"source":" If the source sequence has a large sequence of contiguous items, the common language runtime may throw an <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>."},{"pos":[1490,1497],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows both the extension method and the client code that uses it.","pos":[1501,1588]},{"pos":[1595,1725],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>cscsrefContiguousGroups#1<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-group-results-by-contiguous-keys_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[cscsrefContiguousGroups#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-group-results-by-contiguous-keys_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[1732,1937],"content":"To use the extension method in your project, copy the <ph id=\"ph1\">`MyExtensions`</ph> static class to a new or existing source code file and if it is required, add a <ph id=\"ph2\">`using`</ph> directive for the namespace where it is located.","source":"To use the extension method in your project, copy the `MyExtensions` static class to a new or existing source code file and if it is required, add a `using` directive for the namespace where it is located."},{"pos":[1946,1954],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1958,1992],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ Query Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)"}]}
