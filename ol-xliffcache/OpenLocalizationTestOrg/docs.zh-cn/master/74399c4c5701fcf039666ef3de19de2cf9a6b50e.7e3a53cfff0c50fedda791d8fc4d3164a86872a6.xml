All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `true` if the two collections have common elements; otherwise, `false`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n OVERLAPS provides functionally equivalent to the following:  \n  \n `EXISTS ( expression INTERSECT expression )`  \n  \n OVERLAPS is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. For precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators, see [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses the OVERLAPS operator to determines whether two collections have a common value. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  \n  \n2.
