are displayed in the left pane of the Windows Explorer feature in Windows operating systems.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [TreeView Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what the control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-and-remove-nodes-with-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)  \n Gives instructions for adding and remove nodes from a tree view.  \n  \n [How to: Add Custom Information to a TreeView or ListView Control (Windows Forms)](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-custom-information-to-a-treeview-or-listview-control-wf.md)  \n Gives instructions for deriving an item in a list view or a node in a tree view

Clicked](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-determine-which-treeview-node-was-clicked-windows-forms.md)  \n Gives instructions for determining which node in a tree view was clicked, so the application can respond appropriately.  \n  \n [How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control](how-to-iterate-through-all-nodes-of-a-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)  \n Gives instructions for examining every node in a tree view.  \n  \n [How to: Set Icons for the Windows Forms TreeView Control](how-to-set-icons-for-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)  \n Gives instructions for displaying icons for the nodes of a tree view.  \n  \n [How to: Attach a ShortCut Menu to a TreeView Node](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-attach-a-shortcut-menu-to-a-treeview-node.md)  \n Demonstrates how to add a shortcut menu to a tree view node.  \n  \n Also see [How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233651\\(v=vs.110\\)), [How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the
