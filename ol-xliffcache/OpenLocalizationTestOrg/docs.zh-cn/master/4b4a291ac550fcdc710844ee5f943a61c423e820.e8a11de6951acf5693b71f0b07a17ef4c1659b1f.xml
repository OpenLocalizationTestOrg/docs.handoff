In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31104  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the access modifier from the `Set` statement. It represents the entire `WriteOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)\n- [How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,223],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31104\"\n  - \"vbc31104\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31104\"\nms.assetid: d1ac04a8-e436-4f3e-8d71-fc4569b35fcd","nodes":[{"content":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","nodes":[{"content":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[230,292],"content":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","linkify":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","nodes":[{"content":"'WriteOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Set'","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[293,548],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`WriteOnly`</ph> property declaration specifies access levels in both the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md)</ept> and the <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Set Statement<ept id=\"p2\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/set-statement.md)</ept>.","source":"A `WriteOnly` property declaration specifies access levels in both the [Property Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md) and the [Set Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/set-statement.md)."},{"content":"You can always specify an access level for the property.","pos":[555,611]},{"content":"In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (<ph id=\"ph1\">`Get`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`Set`</ph>), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level.","pos":[612,792],"source":" In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level."},{"content":"You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.","pos":[793,862]},{"pos":[869,890],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31104","source":"**Error ID:** BC31104"},{"pos":[899,920],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the access modifier from the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Set`</ph> statement.","pos":[930,982],"source":"Remove the access modifier from the `Set` statement."},{"content":"It represents the entire <ph id=\"ph1\">`WriteOnly`</ph> property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.","pos":[983,1085],"source":" It represents the entire `WriteOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property."},{"pos":[1094,1102],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1106,1217],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[1220,1394],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)"}]}
