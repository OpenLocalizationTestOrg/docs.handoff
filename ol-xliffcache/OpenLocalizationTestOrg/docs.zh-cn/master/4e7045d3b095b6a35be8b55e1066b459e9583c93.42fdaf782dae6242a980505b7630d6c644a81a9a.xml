If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to any hosting method return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `data` parameter is a pointer to an object of unspecified type. If the `event` parameter is `Event_DomainUnload`, `data` is the numeric identifier for the <xref:System.AppDomain> that was unloaded. The host can take appropriate action using this identifier as a key.  \n  \n If `event` is `Event_MDAFired`, `data` is a pointer to an [MDAInfo](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/mdainfo-structure.md) instance that contains the message output from a Managed Debugging Assistant (MDA). MDAs are a feature of the CLR that help developers with debugging, by generating XML messages about events that are otherwise difficult to trap. Such messages can be especially useful in debugging transitions between managed and unmanaged code.
