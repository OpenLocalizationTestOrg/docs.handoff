These topics cover workflow service specific configuration, all other configuration is done in the same way as a regular [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Configure Persistence with WorkflowServiceHost](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-persistence-with-workflowservicehost.md)  \n Describes how to

WorkflowServiceHost](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-tracking-with-workflowservicehost.md)  \n Describes how to configure workflow tracking for a workflow service using

WorkflowServiceHost](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-idle-behavior-with-workflowservicehost.md)  \n Describes how to configure the idle behavior of a workflow service
