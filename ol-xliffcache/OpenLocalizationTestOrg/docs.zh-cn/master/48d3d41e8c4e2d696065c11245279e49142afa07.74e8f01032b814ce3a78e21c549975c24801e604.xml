{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Cancel Async Tasks after a Period of Time (C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 194282c2-399f-46da-a7a6-96674e00b0b3\n---\n# Cancel async tasks after a period of time (C#)\n\nYou can cancel an asynchronous operation after a period of time by using the  <xref:System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.CancelAfter%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method if you don't want to wait for the operation to finish. This method schedules the cancellation of any associated tasks that aren’t complete within the period of time that’s designated by the `CancelAfter` expression.\n\nThis example adds to the code that’s developed in [Cancel an Async Task or a List of Tasks (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-an-async-task-or-a-list-of-tasks.md) to download a list of websites and to display the length of the contents of each one.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To run the examples, you must have Visual Studio 2012 or newer and the .NET Framework 4.5 or newer installed on your computer.\n\n## Download the example\n\nYou can download the complete Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) project from [Async Sample: Fine Tuning Your Application](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Async-Fine-Tuning-Your-a676abea) and then follow these steps.\n\n1.  Decompress the file that you downloaded, and then start Visual Studio.\n\n2.  On the menu bar, choose **File** > **Open** > **Project/Solution**.\n\n3.  In the **Open Project** dialog box, open the folder that holds the sample code that you decompressed, and then open the solution (.sln) file for AsyncFineTuningCS.\n\n4.  In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the **CancelAfterTime** project, and then choose **Set as StartUp Project**.\n\n5.  Choose the **F5** key to run the project. (Or, press **Ctrl**+**F5** to run the project without debugging it).\n\n6.  Run the program several times to verify that the output might show output for all websites, no websites, or some web sites.\n\nIf you don't want to download the project, you can review the MainWindow.xaml.cs file at the end of this topic.\n\n## Build the example\n\nThe example in this topic adds to the project that's developed in [Cancel an Async Task or a List of Tasks (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/cancel-an-async-task-or-a-list-of-tasks.md) to cancel a list of tasks. The example uses the same UI, although the **Cancel** button isn’t used explicitly.\n\nTo build the example yourself, step by step, follow the instructions in the \"Downloading the Example\" section, but choose **CancelAListOfTasks** as the **StartUp Project**. Add the changes in this topic to that project.\n\nTo specify a maximum time before the tasks are marked as canceled, add a call to `CancelAfter` to `startButton_Click`, as the following example shows. The addition is marked with asterisks.\n\n```csharp\nprivate async void startButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    // Instantiate the CancellationTokenSource.\n    cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\n\n    resultsTextBox.Clear();\n\n    try\n    {\n        // ***Set up the CancellationTokenSource to cancel after 2.5 seconds. (You\n        // can adjust the time.)\n        cts.CancelAfter(2500);\n\n        await AccessTheWebAsync(cts.Token);\n        resultsTextBox.Text += \"\\r\\nDownloads succeeded.\\r\\n\";\n    }\n    catch (OperationCanceledException)\n    {\n        resultsTextBox.Text += \"\\r\\nDownloads canceled.\\r\\n\";\n    }\n    catch (Exception)\n    {\n        resultsTextBox.Text += \"\\r\\nDownloads failed.\\r\\n\";\n    }\n\n    cts = null;\n}\n```\n\n Run the program several times to verify that the output might show output for all websites, no websites, or some web sites. The following output is a sample.\n\n```\nLength of the downloaded string: 35990.\n\nLength of the downloaded string: 407399.\n\nLength of the downloaded string: 226091.\n\nDownloads canceled.\n```\n\n## Complete example\n\nThe following code is the complete text of the MainWindow.xaml.cs file for the example. Asterisks mark the elements that were added for this example.\n\nNotice that you must add a reference for <xref:System.Net.Http>.\n\nYou can download the project from [Async Sample: Fine Tuning Your Application](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Async-Fine-Tuning-Your-a676abea).\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Text;\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\nusing System.Windows;\nusing System.Windows.Controls;\nusing System.Windows.Data;\nusing System.Windows.Documents;\nusing System.Windows.Input;\nusing System.Windows.Media;\nusing System.Windows.Media.Imaging;\nusing System.Windows.Navigation;\nusing System.Windows.Shapes;\n\n// Add a using directive and a reference for System.Net.Http.\nusing System.Net.Http;\n\n// Add the following using directive.\nusing System.Threading;\n\nnamespace CancelAfterTime\n{\n    public partial class MainWindow : Window\n    {\n        // Declare a System.Threading.CancellationTokenSource.\n        CancellationTokenSource cts;\n\n        public MainWindow()\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n        }\n\n        private async void startButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n        {\n            // Instantiate the CancellationTokenSource.\n            cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\n\n            resultsTextBox.Clear();\n\n            try\n            {\n                // ***Set up the CancellationTokenSource to cancel after 2.5 seconds.
