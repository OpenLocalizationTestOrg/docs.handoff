This sample uses two common control flows, Sequence and While, to demonstrate how to do this.\n\n## Sample Details\n Starting with `MySequence`, the first thing to notice is that it derives from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>. <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> is the <xref:System.Activities.Activity> object that exposes the full breadth of the workflow runtime through the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext> passed to the `Execute` method.\n\n `MySequence` exposes a public collection of <xref:System.Activities.Activity> objects that gets populated by the workflow author. Before the workflow is executed, the workflow runtime calls the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.CacheMetadata%2A> method on each activity in a workflow. During this process, the runtime establishes parent-child relationships for data scoping and lifetime management. The default implementation of the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.CacheMetadata%2A> method uses the <xref:System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor> instance class for the `MySequence` activity to add any public property of type <xref:System.Activities.Activity> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>\\<<xref:System.Activities.Activity>> as children of the `MySequence` activity.\n\n Whenever an activity exposes a public collection of child activities, it is likely those child activities share state. It is a best practice for the parent activity, in this case `MySequence`, to also expose a collection of variables through which the child activities can accomplish this. Like child activities, the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.CacheMetadata%2A> method adds public properties of type <xref:System.Activities.Variable> or <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>\\<<xref:System.Activities.Variable>> as variables associated with the `MySequence` activity.\n\n Besides the public variables, which are manipulated by the children of `MySequence`, `MySequence` must also keep track of where it is in the execution of its children. It uses a private variable, `currentIndex`, to accomplish this. This variable is registered as part of the `MySequence` environment by adding a call to the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityMetadata.AddImplementationVariable%2A> method within the `MySequence` activity’s <xref:System.Activities.Activity.CacheMetadata%2A> method. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity> objects added to the `MySequence` `Activities` collection cannot access variables added this way.\n\n When `MySequence` is executed by the runtime, the runtime calls its <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity.Execute%2A> method, passing in an <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext>. The <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext> is the activity’s proxy back into the runtime for dereferencing arguments and variables as well as scheduling other <xref:System.Activities.Activity> objects, or `ActivityDelegates`. `MySequence` uses an `InternalExecute` method to encapsulate the logic of scheduling the first child and all subsequent children in a single method. It starts by dereferencing the `currentIndex`. If it is equal to the count in the `Activities` collection, then the sequence is finished, the activity returns without scheduling any work and the runtime moves it into the <xref:System.Activities.ActivityInstanceState.Closed> state. If the `currentIndex` is less than the count of activities, the next child is obtained from the `Activities` collection and `MySequence` calls <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext.ScheduleActivity%2A>, passing in the child to be scheduled and a <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback> that points at the `InternalExecute` method. Finally, the `currentIndex` is incremented and control is yielded back to the runtime. As long as an instance of `MySequence` has a child <xref:System.Activities.Activity> object scheduled, the runtime considers it to be in the Executing state.\n\n When the child activity completes, the <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback> is executed. The loop continues from the top. Like `Execute`, a <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback> takes an <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext>, giving the implementer access to the runtime.\n\n `MyWhile` differs from `MySequence` in that it schedules a single <xref:System.Activities.Activity> object repeatedly, and in that it uses a <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601><bool\\> named `Condition` to determine whether this scheduling should occur. Like `MySequence`, `MyWhile` uses an `InternalExecute` method to centralize its scheduling logic. It schedules the `Condition`<xref:System.Activities.Activity><bool\\> with a <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback%601>\\<bool> named `OnEvaluationCompleted`. When the execution of `Condition` is completed, its result becomes available through this <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback> in a strongly-typed parameter named `result`. If `true`, `MyWhile` calls  <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext.ScheduleActivity%2A>, passing in the `Body`<xref:System.Activities.Activity> object and `InternalExecute` as the <xref:System.Activities.CompletionCallback>. When the execution of `Body` completes, `Condition` gets scheduled again in `InternalExecute`, starting the loop over again. When the `Condition` returns `false`, an instance of `MyWhile` gives control back to the runtime without scheduling the `Body` and the runtime moves it to the <xref:System.Activities.ActivityInstanceState.Closed> state.\n\n#### To set up, build, and run the sample\n\n1.
