Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [GroupBox Control Overview](groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control](how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)  \n Describes how to use this control to group controls.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,258],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], grouping\"\n  - \"GroupBox control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"grouping controls [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: ee7fb3ed-2fae-4df3-bdeb-15d42e5d7d75","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[265,297],"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"GroupBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[298,422],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use group boxes to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[423,486]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[487,597]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a group box gives the user a logical visual cue.","pos":[598,670]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control; however, only the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control displays a caption, and only the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control can have scroll bars.","pos":[671,940],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars."},{"pos":[949,964],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GroupBox Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[968,1039],"source":"[GroupBox Control Overview](groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.","pos":[1043,1109]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)</ept>","pos":[1116,1246],"source":"[How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control](how-to-group-controls-with-the-windows-forms-groupbox-control.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to use this control to group controls.","pos":[1250,1302]},{"pos":[1311,1320],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1364,1418]},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1462,1516]},{"pos":[1525,1541],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1545,1616],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1620,1711]}]}
