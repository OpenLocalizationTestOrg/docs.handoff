Instead, long paths of up to 32K characters are supported.  \n  \n## Impact  \n Apps recompiled to target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] and that previously threw a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> automatically because a path exceeded 260 characters will now throw a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> only under the following conditions:  \n  \n-   The length of the path is greater than  <xref:System.Int16.MaxValue?displayProperty=fullName> (32,767) characters.  \n  \n-   The operating system returns `COR_E_PATHTOOLONG` or its equivalent.  \n  \n The legacy behavior for apps that target the[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and earlier is that the runtime automatically throws a <xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> whenever a path exceeds 260 characters.  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n For apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)], you can opt out of long path support if it is not desirable by adding the following to    to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>   \n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IO.BlockLongPaths=true\" />   \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n For apps that target earlier versions of the .NET Framework but run on the [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] or later., you can opt in to long path support by adding the following to    to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your app.config file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>   \n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides
