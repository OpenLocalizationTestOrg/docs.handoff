Use the [ICLRStrongName::StrongNameVerificationFromImage](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamesignatureverificationfromimage-method.md) method instead.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nBOOLEAN StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage (  \n    [in]  BYTE    *pbBase,  \n    [in]  DWORD   dwLength,  \n    [in]  DWORD   dwInFlags,  \n    [out] DWORD   *pdwOutFlags  \n);  \n```  \n  \n## Parameters  \n `pbBase`  \n [in] The relative virtual address of the mapped assembly manifest.  \n  \n `dwLength`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the mapped image.  \n  \n `dwInFlags`  \n [in] Flags that influence verification behavior. The following values are supported:  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_FORCE_VER` (0x00000001) - Forces verification even if it is necessary to override registry settings.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_INSTALL` (0x00000002) - Specifies that this is the first verification performed on this image.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_ADMIN_ACCESS` (0x00000004) - Specifies that the cache will allow access only to users who have administrative privileges.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_USER_ACCESS` (0x00000008) - Specifies that the assembly will be accessible only to the current user.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_ALL_ACCESS` (0x00000010) - Specifies that the cache will provide no guarantees of access restriction.  \n  \n-   `SN_INFLAG_RUNTIME` (0x80000000) - Reserved for internal debugging.  \n  \n `pdwOutFlags`  \n [out] A flag for additional output information. The following value is supported:  \n  \n-   `SN_OUTFLAG_WAS_VERIFIED` (0x00000001) - This value is set to `false` to specify that the verification succeeded due to registry settings.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `true` on successful completion; otherwise, `false`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n If the `StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage` function does not complete successfully, call the [StrongNameErrorInfo](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/strong-naming/strongnameerrorinfo-function.md) function to retrieve the last generated error.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** StrongName.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in mscoree.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-strongnamesignatureverificationfromimage-method.md)\n- [ICLRStrongName Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrstrongname-interface.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,487],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"StrongNameSignatureVerificationFromImage Function\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  -
