Publishing service metadata makes the metadata available using standardized protocols, such as WS-MetadataExchange (MEX) and HTTP/GET requests. Metadata endpoints are similar to other service endpoints in that they have an address, a binding, and a contract, and they can be added to a service host through configuration or in code. To enable publishing metadata endpoints, you must add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> service behavior to the service.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md)  \n Demonstrates how to configure a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service to publish metadata so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string.  \n  \n [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using Code](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-code.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable metadata publishing for a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service in code so that clients can retrieve the metadata using a WS-MetadataExchange or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Publishing Metadata](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/publishing-metadata.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,350],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Publishing Metadata Endpoints | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
