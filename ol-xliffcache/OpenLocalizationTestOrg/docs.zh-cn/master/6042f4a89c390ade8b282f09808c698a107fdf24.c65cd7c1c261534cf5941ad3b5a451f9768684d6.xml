When this happens, the final entry in the feed contains a link to the next page of data. The URI for the next page of data is obtained by calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601.GetContinuation%2A> method of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601>, which is returned when the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> is executed. The URI represented by this object is then used to load the next page of results. For more information, see [Loading Deferred Content](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/loading-deferred-content-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example uses a `do…while` loop to load `Customers` entities from a paged results from the data service.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#GetCustomersPaged](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#getcustomerspaged)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#GetCustomersPaged](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#getcustomerspaged)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example returns related `Orders` entities with each `Customers` entity and uses a `do…while` loop to load `Customers` entities pages and a nested `while` loop to load pages of related `Orders` entities from the data service.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#GetCustomersPagedNested](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#getcustomerspagednested)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#GetCustomersPagedNested](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#getcustomerspagednested)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Loading Deferred Content](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/loading-deferred-content-wcf-data-services.md)\n- [How to: Load Related Entities](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/how-to-load-related-entities-wcf-data-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,266],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Load Paged Results (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
