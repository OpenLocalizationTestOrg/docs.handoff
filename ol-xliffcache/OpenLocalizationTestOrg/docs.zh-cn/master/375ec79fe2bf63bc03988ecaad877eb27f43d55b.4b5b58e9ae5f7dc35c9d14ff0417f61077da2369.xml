Language functionality that is present only in the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] is disabled.  \n  \n The `/netcf` option is designed to be used with [/sdkpath](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sdkpath.md). The language features disabled by `/netcf` are the same language features not present in the files targeted with `/sdkpath`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/netcf` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line. The `/netcf` option is set when a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] device project is loaded.  \n  \n The `/netcf` option changes the following language features:  \n  \n-   The [End \\<keyword> Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/end-keyword-statement.md) keyword, which terminates execution of a program, is disabled. The following program compiles and runs without `/netcf` but fails at compile time with `/netcf`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#34](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/codesnippet/VisualBasic/netcf_1.vb)]  \n  \n-   Late binding, in all forms, is disabled. Compile-time errors are generated when recognized late-binding scenarios are encountered. The following program compiles and runs without `/netcf` but fails at compile time with `/netcf`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#35](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/codesnippet/VisualBasic/netcf_2.vb)]  \n  \n-   The [Auto](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/auto.md), [Ansi](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/ansi.md), and [Unicode](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/unicode.md) modifiers are disabled. The syntax of the [Declare Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md) statement is also modified to `Declare Sub|Function name Lib \"library\" [Alias \"alias\"] [([arglist])]`. The following code shows the effect of `/netcf` on a compilation.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#36](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/codesnippet/VisualBasic/netcf_3.vb)]  \n  \n-   Using Visual Basic 6.0 keywords that were removed from [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] generates a different error when `/netcf` is used. This affects the error messages for the following keywords:  \n  \n    -   `Open`  \n  \n    -   `Close`  \n  \n    -   `Put`  \n  \n    -   `Print`  \n  \n    -   `Write`  \n  \n    -   `Input`  \n  \n    -   `Lock`  \n  \n    -   `Unlock`  \n  \n    -   `Seek`  \n  \n    -   `Width`  \n  \n    -   `Name`  \n  \n    -   `FreeFile`  \n  \n    -   `EOF`  \n  \n    -   `Loc`  \n  \n    -   `LOF`  \n  \n    -   `Line`  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `Myfile.vb` with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)], using the versions of Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll found in the default installation directory of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] on the C drive.
