that demonstrate workflow tracking in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)].  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Custom Tracking](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/custom-tracking.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a custom tracking participant and write the contents of the tracking data to console.  \n  \n [Tracking Events into Event Tracing in Windows](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/tracking-events-into-event-tracing-in-windows.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] tracking on a workflow service and emit the tracking events in Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).  \n  \n [SQL Tracking](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/sql-tracking.md)  \n Demonstrates how to write a custom SQL tracking participant, that writes tracking records to a SQL database.  \n  \n [Extract WF Data using Tracking](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/extract-wf-data-using-tracking.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use workflow tracking to extract workflow variables and arguments from activities.  \n  \n [Tracking Using a Text File](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/tracking-using-a-text-file.md)  \n Demonstrates how to extend tracking in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] by creating a custom tracking participant.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,37],"content":"Tracking | Microsoft
