The <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> object provides several constructors that allow you to specify valid combinations of these values.  \n  \n### To create a time-based cache policy that uses a cache synchronization date  \n  \n-   Create a time-based cache policy that uses a cache synchronization date by passing a <xref:System.DateTime> object to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateLastSyncPolicy(DateTime when)  \n    {  \n        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   \n            new HttpRequestCachePolicy(when);  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"When: {0}\", when);  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  \n        return policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Function CreateLastSyncPolicy([when] As DateTime) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy([when])  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"When: {0}\", [when])  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  \n        Return policy  \n    End Function  \n    ```  \n  \n The output is similar to the following:  \n  \n```  \nWhen: 1/14/2004 8:07:30 AM  \nLevel:Default CacheSyncDate:1/14/2004 8:07:30 AM  \n```  \n  \n### To create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness  \n  \n-   Create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness by specifying <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpCacheAgeControl> as the `cacheAgeControl` parameter value and passing a <xref:System.TimeSpan> object to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateMinFreshPolicy(TimeSpan span)  \n    {  \n        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   \n            new HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MinFresh, span);  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  \n        return policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Function CreateMinFreshPolicy(span As TimeSpan) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MinFresh, span)  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  \n        Return policy  \n    End Function  \n    ```  \n  \n For the following invocation:  \n  \n```  \nCreateMinFreshPolicy(new TimeSpan(1,0,0));  \n```  \n  \n```  \nLevel:Default MinFresh:3600  \n  \n```  \n  \n### To create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness and maximum age  \n  \n-   Create a time-based cache policy that is based on minimum freshness and maximum age by specifying <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpCacheAgeControl> as the `cacheAgeControl` parameter value and passing two <xref:System.TimeSpan> objects to the <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> constructor, one to specify the maximum age for resources and a second to specify the minimum freshness permitted for an object returned from the cache.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static HttpRequestCachePolicy CreateFreshAndAgePolicy(TimeSpan freshMinimum, TimeSpan ageMaximum)  \n    {  \n        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy =   \n        new HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAgeAndMinFresh, ageMaximum, freshMinimum);  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString());  \n        return policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Function CreateFreshAndAgePolicy(freshMinimum As TimeSpan, ageMaximum As TimeSpan) As HttpRequestCachePolicy  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy(HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAgeAndMinFresh, ageMaximum, freshMinimum)  \n        Console.WriteLine(policy.ToString())  \n        Return policy  \n    End Function  \n    ```  \n  \n For the following invocation:  \n  \n```  \nCreateFreshAndAgePolicy(new TimeSpan(5,0,0), new TimeSpan(10,0,0));  \n```  \n  \n```  \nLevel:Default MaxAge:36000 MinFresh:18000  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Cache Management for Network
