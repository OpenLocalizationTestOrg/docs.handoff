        <trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When working with .NET Framework, you will often encounter the term "managed code".</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This document will explain what this term means and additional information around it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To put it very simply, managed code is just that: code whose execution is managed by a runtime.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this case, the runtime in question is called the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Common Language Runtime<ept id="p1">**</ept> or CLR, regardless of the implementation (<bpt id="p2">[</bpt>Mono<ept id="p2">](https://www.mono-project.com/)</ept> or .NET Framework or .NET Core).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>On top of that, runtime provides several important services such as automatic memory management, security boundaries, type safety etc.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Contrast this to the way you would run a C/C++ program, also called "unmanaged code".</source>

        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In the unmanaged world, the programmer is in charge of pretty much everything.</source>

        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The actual program is, essentially, a binary that the operating system (OS) loads into memory and starts.</source>

        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Everything else, from memory management to security considerations are a burden of the programmer.</source>

        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Managed code is written in one of the high-level languages that can be run on top of .NET, such as C#, Visual Basic, F# and others.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When you compile code written in those languages with their respective compiler, you don’t get machine code.</source>

        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You get <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Intermediate Language<ept id="p1">**</ept> code which the runtime then compiles and executes.</source>

        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>C++ is the one exception to this rule, as it can also produce native, unmanaged binaries that run on Windows.</source>

        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Once you compile your code written in one of these languages, you will get a binary that is made out of IL.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It is important to note that the IL is independent from any specific language that runs on top of the runtime; there is even a separate specification for it that you can read if you’re so inclined.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Once you produce IL from your high-level code, you will most likely want to run it.</source>

        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This is where the CLR takes over and starts the process of <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Just-In-Time<ept id="p1">**</ept> compiling, or <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>JIT-ing<ept id="p2">**</ept> your code from IL to machine code that can actually be run on a CPU.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Of course, the CLR allows passing the boundaries between managed and unmanaged world, and there is a lot of code that does that, even in the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Base Class Libraries<ept id="p1">](framework-libraries.md)</ept>.</source>

        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These provisions would allow you to, for example, wrap up an unmanaged library and call into it.</source>

        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, it is important to note that once you do this, when the code passes the boundaries of the runtime, the actual management of the execution is again in the hand of unmanaged code, and thus falls under the same restrictions.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Similar to this, C# is one language that allows you to use unmanaged constructs such as pointers directly in code by utilizing what is known as <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>unsafe context<ept id="p1">**</ept> which designates a piece of code for which the execution is not managed by the CLR.</source>
