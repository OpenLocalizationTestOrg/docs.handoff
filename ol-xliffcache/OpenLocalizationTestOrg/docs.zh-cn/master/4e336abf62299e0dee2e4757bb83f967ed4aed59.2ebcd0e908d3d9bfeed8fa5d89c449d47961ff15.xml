Removing older versions of the runtime may change the runtime chosen to run shared framework applications, as detailed in the article on [.NET Core version selection](selection.md).\n\n## Should I remove a version?\n\nThe [.NET Core version selection](selection.md) behaviors and the runtime compatibility of .NET Core across updates enables safe removal of previous versions. .NET Core runtime updates are compatible within a major version 'band' such as 1.x and 2.x. Additionally, newer releases of the .NET Core SDK generally maintain the ability to build applications that target previous versions of the runtime in a compatible manner.\n\nIn general, you only need the latest SDK and latest patch version of the runtimes required for your application. Instances where retaining older SDK or Runtime versions include maintaining **project.json**-based applications. Unless your application has specific reasons for earlier SDKs or runtimes, you may safely remove older versions.\n\n## Determine what is installed\n\nStarting with .NET Core 2.1, the .NET CLI has options you can use to list the versions of the SDK and runtime that are installed on your machine.  Use [`dotnet --list-sdks`](../tools/dotnet.md#options) to see the list of SDKs installed on your machine. Use [`dotnet --list-runtimes`](../tools/dotnet.md#options) to see the list of runtimes installed on your machine.

[Windows](#tab/windows)\n\n.NET Core uses the Windows **Add/Remove Programs** dialog to remove versions of the .NET Core runtime and SDK. The following figure shows the **Add/Remove Programs** dialog with several versions of the .NET runtime and SDK installed.\n\n![Add / Remove programs to remove .NET Core](./media/remove-runtime-sdk-versions/programs-and-features.png)\n\nSelect any versions you want to remove from your machine and click **Uninstall**.\n\n# [Linux](#tab/linux)\n\nThere are more options to uninstall .NET Core (either SDK or runtime) on Linux. The best way for you to uninstall .NET Core is to mirror the action you used to install .NET Core. The specifics depend on your chosen distribution and the installation method.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> For Red Hat installations, consult the [Red Hat Getting Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/net_core/2.0/html/getting_started_guide/gs_install_dotnet#install_register_rehel) for information on installing and uninstalling .NET Core.\n\nStarting with .NET Core 2.1, there is no need to uninstall the .NET Core SDK when upgrading it using a package manager. The package manager `update` or `refresh` commands will automatically remove the older version upon the successful installation of a newer version.\n\nIf you installed .NET Core using a package manager, you use that same package manager to uninstall .NET SDK or runtime. .NET Core installations support most popular package managers. Consult the documentation for your distribution's package manager for the precise syntax on your environment:\n\n- [apt-get(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get) is used by Debian based systems, including Ubuntu.\n- [yum(8)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/yum) is used on Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux.\n- [zypper(8)](https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Zypper_manual_(plain)) is used on openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise System (SLES).\n- [dnf(8)](https://dnf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html) is used on Fedora.\n\nIn almost all cases, the command to remove a package is `remove`.\n\nThe package name for the .NET Core SDK installation for most package managers is `dotnet-sdk`, followed by the version number. Starting with the version 2.1.300 of the .NET Core SDK and version `2.1` of the runtime, only the major and minor version numbers are necessary: for example, the .NET Core SDK version 2.1.300 can be referenced as the package `dotnet-sdk-2.1`. Prior versions require the entire version string: for example, `dotnet-sdk-2.1.200` would be required for version 2.1.200 of the .NET Core SDK.\n\nFor machines that have installed only the runtime, and not the SDK, the package name is `dotnet-runtime-<version>` for the .NET Core runtime, and `aspnetcore-runtime-<version>` for the entire runtime stack.\n\n.NET Core installations prior to 2.0 did not uninstall the host application when the SDK was uninstalled using the package manager. Using `apt-get`, the command is:\n\n```bash\napt-get remove dotnet-host\n```\n\nNote that there is no version attached to `dotnet-host`.\n\nIf you installed using a tarball, you must remove .NET Core using the manual method.\n\nYou remove the SDKs and runtimes separately, by removing the directory that contains that version. For example, to remove the 1.0.1 SDK and runtime, you would use the following bash commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet/sdk/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/dotnet/host/fxr/1.0.1\n```\n\nThe parent directories for the SDK and runtime are listed in the output from the `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` command, as shown in the earlier table.\n\n# [macOS](#tab/macos)\n\nOn Mac, you must remove the SDKs and runtimes separately, by removing the directory that contains that version. For example, to remove the 1.0.1 SDK and runtime, you would use the following bash commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App/1.0.1\nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/dotnet/host/fxr/1.0.1\n```\n\nThe parent directories for the SDK and runtime are listed in the output from the `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` command, as shown in the earlier table.\n\n---\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,309],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Remove the .NET Core runtime and SDK\ndescription: This article describes how to determine which versions
