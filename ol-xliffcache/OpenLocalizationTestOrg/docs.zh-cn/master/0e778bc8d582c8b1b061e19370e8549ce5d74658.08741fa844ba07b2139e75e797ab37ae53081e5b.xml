You can intercept these errors and exceptions and then either recover or pass the error information to the user by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.BindingComplete> event for a particular <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CurrencyManager> component.  \n  \n## Example  \n This code example demonstrates how to handle errors and exceptions that occur during a data-binding operation. It demonstrates how to intercept errors by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.BindingComplete?displayProperty=fullName> event of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding> objects. In order to intercept errors and exceptions by handling this event, you must enable formatting for the binding. You can enable formatting when the binding is constructed or added to the binding collection, or by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.FormattingEnabled%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete#3](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete/CPP/form1.cpp#3)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete/CS/form1.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorBindingComplete/VB/form1.vb#3)]  \n  \n When the code is running and an empty string is entered for the part name or a value less than 100 is entered for the part number, a message box appears. This is a result of handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Binding.BindingComplete?displayProperty=fullName> event for these textbox bindings.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.
