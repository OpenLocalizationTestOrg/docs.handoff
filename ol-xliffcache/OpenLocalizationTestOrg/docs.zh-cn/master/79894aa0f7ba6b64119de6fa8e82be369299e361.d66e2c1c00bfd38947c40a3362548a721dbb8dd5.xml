The examples execute both the XPath expression and the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] expression. Each example then compares the results of both queries, validating that the XPath expression is functionally equivalent to the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] query. As both types of queries return nodes from the same XML tree, the query result comparison is made using referential identity.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n|Topic|Description|
