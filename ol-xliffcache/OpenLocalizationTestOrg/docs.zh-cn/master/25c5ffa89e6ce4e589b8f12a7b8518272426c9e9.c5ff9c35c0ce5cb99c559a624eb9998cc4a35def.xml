When you finish using an object that implements <xref:System.IDisposable>, you should call the object's <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> implementation. You can do this in one of two ways:  \n  \n* With the C# `using` statement or the Visual Basic `Using` statement.  \n  \n* By implementing a `try/finally` block.  \n\n## The using statement\n\nThe `using` statement in C# and the `Using` statement in Visual Basic simplify the code that you must write to create and clean up an object. The `using` statement obtains one or more resources, executes the statements that you specify, and automatically disposes of the object. However, the `using` statement is useful only for objects that are used within the scope of the method in which they are constructed.  \n  \nThe following example uses the `using` statement to create and release a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader?displayProperty=nameWithType> object.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Disposable#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/cs/using1.cs#1)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Disposable#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/vb/using1.vb#1)]  \n  \nNote that although the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> class implements the <xref:System.IDisposable> interface, which indicates that it uses an unmanaged resource, the example doesn't explicitly call the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.Dispose%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. When the C# or Visual Basic compiler encounters the `using` statement, it emits intermediate language (IL) that is equivalent to the following code that explicitly contains a `try/finally` block.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Disposable#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/cs/using3.cs#3)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Disposable#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/vb/using3.vb#3)]  \n  \nThe C# `using` statement also allows you to acquire multiple resources in a single statement, which is internally equivalent to nested `using` statements. The following example instantiates two <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> objects to read the contents of two different files.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Disposable#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/cs/using4.cs#4)]\n\n## Try/finally block\n\nInstead of wrapping a `try/finally` block in a `using` statement, you may choose to implement the `try/finally` block directly. This may be your personal coding style, or you might want to do this for one of the following reasons:  \n  \n* To include a `catch` block to handle any exceptions thrown in the `try` block. Otherwise, any exceptions thrown by the `using` statement are unhandled, as are any exceptions thrown within the `using` block if a `try/catch` block isn't present.  \n  \n* To instantiate an object that implements <xref:System.IDisposable> whose scope is not local to the block within which it is declared.  \n  \nThe following example is similar to the previous example, except that it uses a `try/catch/finally` block to instantiate, use, and dispose of a <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> object, and to handle any exceptions thrown by the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> constructor and its <xref:System.IO.StreamReader.ReadToEnd%2A> method. Note that the code in the `finally` block checks that the object that implements <xref:System.IDisposable> isn't `null` before it calls the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method. Failure to do this can result in a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> exception at run time.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Disposable#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/cs/using5.cs#6)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Disposable#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.disposable/vb/using5.vb#6)]  \n  \nYou can follow this basic pattern if you choose to implement or must implement a `try/finally` block, because your programming language doesn't support a `using` statement but does allow direct calls to the <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> method. \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Cleaning Up Unmanaged Resources](../../../docs/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md)\n- [using Statement (C#
