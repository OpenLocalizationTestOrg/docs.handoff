The executable file is created with an .exe extension.<br /><br /> Unless otherwise specified with the `/out` option, the output file name takes the name of the input file that contains the `Sub Main` procedure.<br /><br /> Only one `Sub Main` procedure is required in the source-code files that are compiled into an .exe file. Use the `-main` compiler option to specify which class contains the `Sub Main` procedure.|  \n|`-target:library`|Causes the compiler to create a dynamic-link library (DLL).<br /><br /> The dynamic-link library file is created with a .dll extension.<br /><br /> Unless otherwise specified with the `-out` option, the output file name takes the name of the first input file.<br /><br /> When building a DLL, a `Sub Main` procedure is not required.|  \n|`-target:module`|Causes the compiler to generate a module that can be added to an assembly.<br /><br /> The output file is created with an extension of .netmodule.<br /><br /> The .NET common language runtime cannot load a file that does not have an assembly. However, you can incorporate such a file into the assembly manifest of an assembly by using `-reference`.<br /><br /> When code in one module references internal types in another module, both modules must be incorporated into an assembly manifest by using `-reference`.<br /><br /> The [-addmodule](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/addmodule.md) option imports metadata from a module.|  \n|`-target:winexe`|Causes the compiler to create an executable Windows-based application.<br /><br /> The executable file is created with an .exe extension. A Windows-based application is one that provides a user interface from either the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] class library or with the Windows APIs.<br /><br /> Unless otherwise specified with the `-out` option, the output file name takes the name of the input file that contains the `Sub Main` procedure.<br /><br /> Only one `Sub Main` procedure is required in the source-code files that are compiled into an .exe file. In cases where your code has more than one class that has a `Sub Main` procedure, use the `-main` compiler option to specify which class contains the `Sub Main` procedure|  \n|`-target:appcontainerexe`|Causes the compiler to create an executable Windows-based application that must be run in an app container. This setting is designed to be used for [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](~/includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] applications.<br /><br /> The **appcontainerexe** setting sets a bit in the Characteristics field of the [Portable Executable](/windows/desktop/Debug/pe-format) file. This bit indicates that the app must be run in an app container. When this bit is set, an error occurs if the `CreateProcess` method tries to launch the application outside of an app container. Aside from this bit setting, **-target:appcontainerexe** is equivalent to **-target:winexe**.<br /><br /> The executable file is created with an .exe extension.<br /><br /> Unless you specify otherwise by using the `-out` option, the output file name takes the name of the input file that contains the `Sub Main` procedure.<br /><br /> Only one `Sub Main` procedure is required in the source-code files that are compiled into an .exe file. If your code contains more than one class that has a `Sub Main` procedure, use the `-main` compiler option to specify which class contains the `Sub Main` procedure|  \n|`-target:winmdobj`|Causes the compiler to create an intermediate file that you can convert to a Windows Runtime binary (.winmd) file. The .winmd file can be consumed by JavaScript and C++ programs, in addition to managed language programs.<br /><br /> The intermediate file is created with a .winmdobj extension.<br /><br /> Unless you specify otherwise by using the `-out` option, the output file name takes the name of the first input file. A `Sub Main` procedure isnâ€™t required.<br /><br /> The .winmdobj file is designed to be used as input for the <xref:Microsoft.Build.Tasks.WinMDExp> export tool to produce a Windows metadata (WinMD) file. The WinMD file has a .winmd extension and contains both the code from the original library and the WinMD definitions that JavaScript, C++, and  the Windows Runtime use.|  \n  \n Unless you specify `-target:module`, `-target` causes a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] assembly manifest to be added to an output file.  \n  \n Each instance of Vbc.exe produces, at most, one output file. If you specify a compiler option such as `-out` or `-target` more than one time, the last one the compiler processes is put into effect. Information about all files in a compilation is added to the manifest. All output files except those created with `-target:module` contain assembly metadata in the manifest. Use [Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)](../../../framework/tools/ildasm-exe-il-disassembler.md) to view the metadata in an output file.  \n  \n The short form of `-target` is `-t`.  \n  \n### To set -target in the Visual Studio IDE  \n  \n1.  Have a project selected in **Solution Explorer**. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.   \n  \n2.  Click the **Application** tab.  \n  \n3.  Modify the value in the **Application Type** box.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `in.vb`, creating `in.dll`:  \n  \n```console\nvbc -target:library in.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See
