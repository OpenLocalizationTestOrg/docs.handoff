For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object. Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case. `Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties. `WithEvents` is not supported for private`UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)   \n [Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,560],"nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]}],"pos":[6,76],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID459\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nms.assetid: 785df3f3-2aae-4a25-af36-1f9879d4e5fd\ncaps.latest.revision: 8\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[567,617],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","linkify":"Object or class does not support the set of events","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"You tried to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events.","pos":[618,744],"source":"You tried to use a `WithEvents` variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events."},{"content":"For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that <ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> the first object.","pos":[745,864],"source":" For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object."},{"content":"Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case.","pos":[865,973]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> only implements an interface for methods and properties.","pos":[974,1043],"source":"`Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> is not supported for private<ph id=\"ph2\">`UserControls`</ph>, because the type info needed to raise the <ph id=\"ph3\">`ObjectEvent`</ph> is not available at run time.","pos":[1044,1186],"source":"`WithEvents` is not supported for private`UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time."},{"pos":[1195,1216],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.","pos":[1226,1293]},{"pos":[1302,1310],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WithEvents<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1314,1393],"source":"[WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Implements Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1397,1496],"source":"[Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)"}]}
