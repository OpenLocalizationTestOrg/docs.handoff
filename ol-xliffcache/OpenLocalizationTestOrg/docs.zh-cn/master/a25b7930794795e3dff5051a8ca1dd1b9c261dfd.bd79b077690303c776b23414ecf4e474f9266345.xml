It's implemented as an [MSBuild target](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets), so the project is evaluated when the command is run. Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned. Both intermediate (*obj*) and final output (*bin*) folders are cleaned.\n\n## Arguments\n\n`PROJECT`\n\nThe MSBuild project to clean. If a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in *proj* and uses that file.\n\n## Options\n\n* **`-c|--configuration {Debug|Release}`**\n\n  Defines the build configuration. The default value is `Debug`. This option is only required when cleaning if you specified it during build time.\n\n* **`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`**\n\n  The [framework](../../standard/frameworks.md) that was specified at build time. The framework must be defined in the [project file](csproj.md). If you specified the framework at build time, you must specify the framework when cleaning.\n\n* **`-h|--help`**\n\n  Prints out a short help for the command.\n\n* **`-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`**\n\n  Directory in which the build outputs are placed. Specify the `-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>` switch with the output directory switch if you specified the framework when the project was built.\n\n* **`-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>`**\n\n  Cleans the output folder of the specified runtime. This is used when a [self-contained deployment](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd) was created. Option available since .NET Core 2.0 SDK.\n\n* **`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`**\n\n  Sets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed levels are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].\n\n## Examples\n\n* Clean a default build of the project:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet clean\n  ```\n\n* Clean a project built using the Release configuration:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet clean --configuration Release\n  ```","nodes":[{"pos":[4,119],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: dotnet clean command\ndescription: The dotnet clean command cleans the current directory.\nms.date: 12/04/2018","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet clean command","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"dotnet clean command","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet clean command","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"The dotnet clean command cleans the current directory.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"The dotnet clean command cleans the current directory.","nodes":[{"content":"The dotnet clean command cleans the current directory.","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[126,138],"content":"dotnet clean","linkify":"dotnet clean","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet clean","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[237,241],"content":"Name","linkify":"Name","nodes":[{"content":"Name","pos":[0,4]}]},{"pos":[243,291],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet clean`</ph> -
