You can run all the tools from the command line.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  For the .NET Framework tools to function properly, you must set your Path, Include, and Lib environment variables correctly. Set these environment variables by running SDKVars.bat, which is located in the \\<SDK>\\v2.0\\Bin directory. SDKVars.bat must be executed in every command shell.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n|Tool|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|[XML Serializer Generator Tool (Sgen.exe)](../../../docs/framework/serialization/xml-serializer-generator-tool-sgen-exe.md)|Creates an XML serialization assembly for types in a specified assembly in order to improve the run-time performance of the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>.|  \n|[XML Schema Definition Tool (Xsd.exe)](../../../docs/framework/serialization/xml-schema-definition-tool-xsd-exe.md)|Generates XML schemas that follow the XSD language proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
