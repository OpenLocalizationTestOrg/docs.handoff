Drag three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls from the **Toolbox** onto the form.  \n  \n     Position them near to each other, but leave them unaligned.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control icon.  \n  \n     Do not drag the icon onto the form.  \n  \n3.  Move the mouse pointer close to the three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  \n  \n     The pointer changes to a crosshair with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control icon attached.  \n  \n4.  Click and hold the mouse button.  \n  \n5.  Drag the mouse pointer to draw the outline of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n6.  Draw the outline around the three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls.  \n  \n7.  Release the mouse button.  \n  \n     The three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls are now inserted into the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel>   \n [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using a TableLayoutPanel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-a-tablelayoutpanel.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,85],"content":"How to: Reassign Existing Controls to a Different Parent | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reassign Existing Controls to a Different Parent | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,73]}]},{"pos":[568,624],"content":"How to: Reassign Existing Controls to a Different Parent","linkify":"How to: Reassign Existing Controls to a Different Parent","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Reassign Existing Controls to a Different Parent","pos":[0,56]}]},{"content":"You can assign controls that exist on your form to a new container control.","pos":[625,700]},{"pos":[708,1084],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
