Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested critical section.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A spin count is used only on a multi-processor system. The spin count specifies the number of times a calling thread must spin before it performs a wait operation on a semaphore that is associated with an unavailable critical section. If the critical section becomes free during the spin operation, the calling thread avoids the wait operation. `CreateCrstWithSpinCount` mirrors the Win32 `InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount` function.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:**
