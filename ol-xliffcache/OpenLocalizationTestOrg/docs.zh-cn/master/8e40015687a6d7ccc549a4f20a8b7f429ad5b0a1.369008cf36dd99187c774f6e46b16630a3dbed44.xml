The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as width and color, of the line used to render the ellipse. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method. The remaining arguments passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method specify the bounding rectangle for the ellipse. The following illustration shows an ellipse along with its bounding rectangle.  \n  \n ![Ellipses and arcs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art05.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art05\")  \n  \n The following example draws an ellipse; the bounding rectangle has a width of 80, a height of 40, and an upper-left corner of (100, 50):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#51](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#51)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#51](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#51)]  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> is an overloaded method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, so there are several ways you can supply it with arguments. For example, you can construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> and pass the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method as an argument:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#52](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#52)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#52](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#52)]  \n  \n## Drawing an Arc  \n An arc is a portion of an ellipse. To draw an arc, you call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class. The parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> method are the same as the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawEllipse%2A> method, except that <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawArc%2A> requires a starting angle and sweep angle. The following example draws an arc with a starting angle of 30 degrees and a sweep angle of 180 degrees:  \n  \n
