This collection has the following capabilities, accessed via the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager> class:  \n  \n1.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager.GetValue%2A>  \n  \n2.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager.Subscribe%2A>  \n  \n3.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager.Unsubscribe%2A>  \n  \n4.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager.SetValue%2A>  \n  \n## The Services collection  \n The <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.EditingContext.Services%2A> collection is used to access services that the designer uses to interact with the host, or services that all designers use. This collection has the following methods of note:  \n  \n1.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Publish%2A>  \n  \n2.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Subscribe%2A>  \n  \n3.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Unsubscribe%2A>  \n  \n4.  <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.GetService%2A>  \n  \n## Assigning a designer an activity  \n To specify which designer an activity uses, the Designer attribute is used.  \n  \n```  \n[Designer(typeof(MyClassDesigner))]  \npublic sealed class MyClass : CodeActivity  \n{  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Creating a service  \n To create a service that serves as a conduit of information between the designer and the host, an interface and an implementation must be created. The interface is used by the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Publish%2A> method to define the members of the service, and the implementation contains the logic for the service. In the following code example, a service interface and implementation are created.  \n  \n```  \npublic interface IMyService  \n    {  \n        IEnumerable<string> GetValues(string DisplayName);  \n    }  \n  \n    public class MyServiceImpl : IMyService  \n    {  \n        public IEnumerable<string> GetValues(string DisplayName)  \n        {  \n            return new string[]  {   \n                DisplayName + \" One\",   \n                DisplayName + \" Two\",  \n                \"Three \" + DisplayName  \n            } ;  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Publishing a service  \n For a designer to consume a service, it must first be published by the host using the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Publish%2A> method.  \n  \n```  \nthis.Context.Services.Publish<IMyService>(new MyServiceImpl);  \n```  \n  \n## Subscribing to a service  \n The designer obtains access to the service using the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ServiceManager.Subscribe%2A> method in the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowViewElement.OnModelItemChanged%2A> method. The following code snippet demonstrates how to subscribe to a service.  \n  \n```  \nprotected override void OnModelItemChanged(object newItem)  \n{  \n    if (!subscribed)  \n    {  \n        this.Context.Services.Subscribe<IMyService>(  \n            servInstance =>  \n            {  \n                listBox1.ItemsSource = servInstance.GetValues(this.ModelItem.Properties[\"DisplayName\"].ComputedValue.ToString());  \n            }  \n            );  \n        subscribed = true;   \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n## Sharing data using the Items collection  \n Using the Items collection is similar to using the Services collection, except that <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ContextItemManager.SetValue%2A> is used instead of Publish. This collection is more appropriate for sharing simple data between the designers and the host, rather than complex functionality.  \n  \n## EditingContext host items and services  \n The .Net Framework provides a number of built-in items and services accessed through the editing context.  \n  \n Items:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Hosting.AssemblyContextControlItem>: Manages the list of referenced local assemblies that will be used inside the workflow for controls (such as the expression editor).  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Hosting.ReadOnlyState>: Indicates whether the designer is in a read-only state.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.Selection>: Defines the collection of objects that are currently selected.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Hosting.WorkflowCommandExtensionItem>:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowFileItem>: Provides information on the file that the current editing session is based on.  \n  \n Services:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.AttachedPropertiesService>: Allows properties to be added to the current instance, using <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.AttachedPropertiesService.AddProperty%2A>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.DesignerView>: Allows access to the properties of the designer canvas.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.IActivityToolboxService>: Allows the contents of the toolbox to be updated.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Hosting.ICommandService>: Used to integrate designer commands (such as Context Menu) with custom-provided service implementations.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Debug.IDesignerDebugView>: Provides functionality for the designer debugger.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.IExpressionEditorService>: Provides access to the Expression Editor dialog.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.IIntegratedHelpService>: Provides the designer with integrated help functionality.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Validation.IValidationErrorService>: Provides access to validation errors using <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Validation.IValidationErrorService.ShowValidationErrors%2A>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.IWorkflowDesignerStorageService>: Provides an internal service to store and retrieve data. This service is used internally by the .Net Framework, and is not intended for external use.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.IXamlLoadErrorService>: Provides access to the XAML load error collection using <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.IXamlLoadErrorService.ShowXamlLoadErrors%2A>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Services.ModelService>: Used by the designer to interact with the model of the workflow being edited.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelTreeManager>: Provides access to the root of the model item tree using <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem.Root%2A>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.UndoEngine>: Provides undo and redo functionality.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Services.ViewService>: Maps visual elements to underlying model items.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.ViewStateService>: Stores view states for model items.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.View.VirtualizedContainerService>: Used to customize the virtual container UI behavior.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Hosting.WindowHelperService>: Used to register and unregister delegates for event notifications. Also allows a window owner to be set.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"Using the ModelItem Editing Context | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Using the
