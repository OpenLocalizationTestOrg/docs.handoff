Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a selected page range, or print a selection. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class.  \n  \n## Working with the Component  \n Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box at run time. This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class). Either of these, in turn, may be shared by multiple printers.  \n  \n When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>\n- [PrintDialog Component](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,308],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"PrintDialog\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Print dialog box [Windows Forms], displaying\"\n  - \"PrintDialog component [Windows Forms], about PrintDialog component\"\nms.assetid: 8327b8ac-1017-4b5e-a88b-fea9dd56999c","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[315,361],"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintDialog<ept id=\"p1\">](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept> component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications.","pos":[362,601],"source":"The Windows Forms [PrintDialog](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications."},{"content":"Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[602,722]},{"content":"You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a selected page range, or print a selection.","pos":[723,845]},{"content":"By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.","pos":[846,974]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog&gt;</ph> component inherits from the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[975,1094],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog> class."},{"pos":[1103,1129],"content":"Working with the Component","linkify":"Working with the Component","nodes":[{"content":"Working with the Component","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A&gt;</ph> method to display the dialog box at run time.","pos":[1133,1241],"source":"Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box at run time."},{"content":"This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings&gt;</ph> class).","pos":[1242,1462],"source":" This component has properties that relate to either a single print job (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> class) or the settings of an individual printer (<xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class)."},{"content":"Either of these, in turn, may be shared by multiple printers.","pos":[1463,1524]},{"pos":[1531,1677],"content":"When it is added to a form, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog&gt;</ph> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.","source":"When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer."},{"pos":[1686,1694],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1740,1803],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[PrintDialog Component](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)"}]}
