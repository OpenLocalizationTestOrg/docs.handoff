This parameter is passed by the common language runtime (CLR) to the domain callback. It is not runtime-managed heap memory; both the allocation and lifetime of this memory are controlled by the caller.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`ExecuteInAppDomain` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `ExecuteInAppDomain` allows the host to exercise control over which managed <xref:System.AppDomain> the specified managed method should be executed in. You can get the value of an application domain's identifier, which corresponds to the value of the <xref:System.AppDomain.Id%2A> property, by calling [GetCurrentAppDomainId Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-getcurrentappdomainid-method.md).  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ICLRRuntimeHost Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,71],"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[740,782],"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method","linkify":"ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::ExecuteInAppDomain Method","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"Specifies the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.AppDomain&gt;</ph> in which to execute the specified managed code.","pos":[783,868],"source":"Specifies the <xref:System.AppDomain> in which to execute the specified managed code."},{"pos":[877,883],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1047,1057],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] The numeric ID of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.AppDomain&gt;</ph> in which to execute the specified method.","pos":[1078,1170],"source":" [in] The numeric ID of the <xref:System.AppDomain> in which to execute the specified method."},{"content":"[in] A pointer to the function to execute within the specified <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.AppDomain&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1192,1279],"source":" [in] A pointer to the function to execute within the specified <xref:System.AppDomain>."},{"content":"[in] A pointer to opaque caller-allocated memory.","pos":[1298,1347]},{"content":"This parameter is passed by the common language runtime (CLR) to the domain callback.","pos":[1348,1433]},{"content":"It is not runtime-managed heap memory;
