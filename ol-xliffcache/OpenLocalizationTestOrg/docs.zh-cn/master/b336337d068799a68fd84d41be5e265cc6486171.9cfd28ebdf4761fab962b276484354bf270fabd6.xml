For example, the [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-customers-and-orders-linq-to-xml.md) XML document contains a list of customers and a list of orders. Each `Customer` element contains a `CustomerID` attribute. Each `Order` element contains a `CustomerID` element. The `CustomerID` element in each order refers to the `CustomerID` attribute in a customer.  \n  \n The topic [Sample XSD File: Customers and Orders](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xsd-file-customers-and-orders.md) contains an XSD that can be used to validate this document. It uses the `xs:key` and `xs:keyref` features of XSD to establish that the `CustomerID` attribute of the `Customer` element is a key, and to establish a relationship between the `CustomerID` element in each `Order` element and the `CustomerID` attribute in each `Customer` element.  \n  \n With [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)], you can take advantage of this relationship by using the `Join` clause.  \n  \n Note that because there is no index available, such joining will have poor runtime performance.  \n  \n For more detailed information about `Join`, see [Join Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/join-operations.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example joins the `Customer` elements to the `Order` elements, and generates a new XML document that includes the `CompanyName` element in the orders.  \n  \n Before executing the query, the example validates that the document complies with the schema in [Sample XSD File: Customers and Orders](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xsd-file-customers-and-orders.md). This ensures that the join clause will always work.  \n  \n This query first retrieves all `Customer` elements, and then joins them to the `Order` elements. It selects only the orders for customers with a `CustomerID` greater than \"K\". It then projects a new `Order` element that contains the customer information within each order.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-customers-and-orders-linq-to-xml.md).  \n  \n This example uses the following XSD schema: [Sample XSD File: Customers and Orders](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xsd-file-customers-and-orders.md).  \n  \n Note that joining in this fashion will not perform very well. Joins are performed via a linear search. There are no hash tables or indexes to help with performance.  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Class Program  \n    Public Shared errors As Boolean = False  \n  \n    Public Shared Function LamValidEvent(ByVal
