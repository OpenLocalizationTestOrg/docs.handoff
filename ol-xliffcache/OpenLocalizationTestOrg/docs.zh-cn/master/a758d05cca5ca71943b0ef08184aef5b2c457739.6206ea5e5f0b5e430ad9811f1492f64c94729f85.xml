The `Set` procedure should then store the incoming value in this `Private` variable.  \n  \n The `Get` procedure behaves like a `Function` procedure, so it can assign a value to the property name and return control by encountering the `End Get` statement. The recommended approach, however, is to include the `Private` variable as the value in a [Return Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md).  \n  \n The `Set` procedure behaves like a `Sub` procedure, which does not return a value. Therefore, the procedure or property name has no special meaning within a `Set` procedure, and you cannot store a value into it.  \n  \n The following example illustrates the approach that can cause this error, followed by the recommended approach.  \n  \n```  \nPublic Class illustrateProperties  \n' The code in the following property causes this error.  \n    Public Property badProp() As Char  \n        Get  \n            Dim charValue As Char  \n            ' Insert code to update charValue.  \n            badProp = charValue  \n        End Get  \n        Set(ByVal Value As Char)  \n            ' The following statement causes this error.  \n            badProp = Value  \n            ' The value stored in the local variable badProp  \n            ' is not used by the Get procedure in this property.  \n        End Set  \n    End Property  \n' The following code uses the recommended approach.  \n    Private propValue As Char  \n    Public Property goodProp() As Char  \n        Get  \n            ' Insert code to update propValue.  \n            Return propValue  \n        End Get  \n        Set(ByVal Value As Char)  \n            propValue = Value  \n        End Set  \n    End Property  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
