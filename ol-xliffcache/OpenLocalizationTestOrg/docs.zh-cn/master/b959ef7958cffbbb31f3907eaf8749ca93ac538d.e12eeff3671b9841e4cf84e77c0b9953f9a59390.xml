The name of the file that will contain your bug report. Enclose the file name in quotation marks (\" \") if the name contains a space.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The following information is added to `file`:  \n  \n-   A copy of all source-code files in the compilation.  \n  \n-   A list of the compiler options used in the compilation.  \n  \n-   Version information about your compiler, common language runtime, and operating system.  \n  \n-   Compiler output, if any.  \n  \n-   A description of the problem, for which you are prompted.  \n  \n-   A description of how you think the problem should be fixed, for which you are prompted.  \n  \n Because a copy of all source-code files is included in `file`, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The `/bugreport` option produces a file that contains potentially sensitive information. This includes current time, compiler version, [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version, OS version, user name, the command-line arguments with which the compiler was run, all source code, and the binary form of any referenced assembly. This option can be accessed by specifying command-line options in the Web.config file for a server-side compilation of an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] application. To prevent this, modify the Machine.config file to disallow users from compiling on the server.  \n  \n If this option is used with `/errorreport:prompt`, `/errorreport:queue`, or `/errorreport:send`, and your application encounters an internal compiler error, the information in `file` is sent to Microsoft Corporation. That information will help Microsoft engineers identify the cause of the error and may help improve the next release of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]. By default, no information is sent to Microsoft. However, when you compile an application by using `/errorreport:queue`, which is enabled by default, the application collects its error reports. Then, when the computer's administrator logs in, the error reporting system displays a pop-up window that enables the administrator to forward to Microsoft any error reports that occurred since the logon.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/bugreport` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when you compile from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example compiles `T2.vb` and puts all bug-reporting information in the file `Problem.txt`.  \n  \n```  \nvbc /bugreport:problem.txt t2.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [/debug (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/debug.md)   \n [/errorreport](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/errorreport.md)   \n [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)   \n [trustLevel Element for securityPolicy (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/729ab04c-03da-4ee5-86b1-be9d08a09369)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,657],"nodes":[{"content":"/bugreport | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"/bugreport | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"/bugreport | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,27]}]}],"pos":[6,36],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"/bugreport | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"-bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: e4325406-8dbd-4b48-b311-9ee0799e48bb\ncaps.latest.revision: 22\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[664,674],"content":"/bugreport","linkify":"/bugreport","nodes":[{"content":"/bugreport","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"Creates a file that you can use when you file a bug report.","pos":[675,734]},{"pos":[743,749],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[791,800],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Term","pos":[807,811]},{"content":"Definition","pos":[812,822]},{"content":"Required.","pos":[846,855]},{"content":"The name of the file that will contain your bug report.","pos":[856,911]},{"content":"Enclose the file name in quotation marks (\" \") if the name contains a space.","pos":[912,988]},{"pos":[998,1005],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1009,1054],"content":"The following information is added to <ph id=\"ph1\">`file`</ph>:","source":"The following information is added to `file`:"},{"content":"A copy of all source-code files in the compilation.","pos":[1064,1115]},{"content":"A list of the compiler options used in the compilation.","pos":[1125,1180]},{"content":"Version information about your compiler, common language runtime, and operating system.","pos":[1190,1277]},{"content":"Compiler output, if any.","pos":[1287,1311]},{"content":"A description of the problem, for which you are prompted.","pos":[1321,1378]},{"content":"A description of how you think the problem should be fixed, for which you are prompted.","pos":[1388,1475]},{"pos":[1482,1632],"content":"Because a copy of all source-code files is included in <ph id=\"ph1\">`file`</ph>, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program.","source":"Because a copy of all source-code files is included in `file`, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program."},{"pos":[1640,2367],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The `/bugreport` option produces a file that contains potentially sensitive information.
