Use the <xref:System.EventArgs> object to return a reference to the clicked node object.  \n  \n2.  Determine which node was clicked by checking the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewEventArgs> class, which contains data related to the event.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub TreeView1_AfterSelect(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n    ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewEventArgs) Handles TreeView1.AfterSelect  \n       ' Determine by checking the Node property of the TreeViewEventArgs.  \n       MessageBox.Show(e.Node.Text)  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    protected void treeView1_AfterSelect (object sender,   \n    System.Windows.Forms.TreeViewEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       // Determine by checking the Text property.  \n       MessageBox.Show(e.Node.Text);  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void treeView1_AfterSelect(System::Object ^  sender,  \n          System::Windows::Forms::TreeViewEventArgs ^  e)  \n       {  \n          // Determine by checking the Text property.  \n          MessageBox::Show(e->Node->Text);  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  As an alternative, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventArgs> of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseUp> event to get the <xref:System.Drawing.Point.X%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Point.Y%2A> coordinate values of the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> where the click occurred.
