This is illustrated in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HOWTONavigationSnippets#NavigateBackCODE](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTONavigationSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml.cs#navigatebackcode)]\n [!code-vb[HOWTONavigationSnippets#NavigateBackCODE](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTONavigationSnippets/visualbasic/homepage.xaml.vb#navigatebackcode)]  \n  \n **CanGoBack** and **GoBack** are implemented by <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you call **GoBack**, and there are no entries in back navigation history, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is raised.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,283],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"history [WPF], navigating back\"\n  - \"navigation [WPF], through navigation history (back)\"\nms.assetid: 9343234b-d864-441d-b8a7-d895cba80a87","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[290,338],"content":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","linkify":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Navigate Back Through Navigation History","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"This example illustrates how to navigate to entries in back navigation history.","pos":[339,418]},{"pos":[427,434],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[438,787],"content":"Code that is running from content that is hosted in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame&gt;</ph> using <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService&gt;</ph>, or <ph id=\"ph4\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iegeneric](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iegeneric-md.md)]</ph> can navigate back through navigation history, one entry at a time.","source":"Code that is running from content that is hosted in a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> using <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>, or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iegeneric](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iegeneric-md.md)] can navigate back through navigation history, one entry at a time."},{"content":"Navigating back one entry requires first checking that there are entries in back navigation history, by inspecting the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>CanGoBack<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property, before navigating back one entry, by calling the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>GoBack<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> method.","pos":[794,1004],"source":"Navigating back one entry requires first checking that there are entries in back navigation history, by inspecting the **CanGoBack** property, before navigating back one entry, by calling the **GoBack** method."},{"content":"This is illustrated in the following example:","pos":[1005,1050]},{"pos":[1400,1592],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>CanGoBack<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>GoBack<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> are implemented by <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService&gt;</ph>.","source":"**CanGoBack** and **GoBack** are implemented by <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, and <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>."},{"pos":[1600,1741],"content":"[!NOTE]\n If you call **GoBack**, and there are no entries in back navigation history, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is raised.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"If you call <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>GoBack<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and there are no entries in back navigation history, an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.InvalidOperationException&gt;</ph> is raised.","pos":[9,139],"source":"If you call **GoBack**, and there are no entries in back navigation history, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is raised."}]}]}
