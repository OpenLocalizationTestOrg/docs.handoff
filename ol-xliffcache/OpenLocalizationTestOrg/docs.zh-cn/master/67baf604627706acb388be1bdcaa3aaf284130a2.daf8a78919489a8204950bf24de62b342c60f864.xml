This is done by using a *join*. A join is the association of objects in one data source with objects that share a common attribute in another data source, such as a product or contact ID. In object-oriented programming, relationships between objects are relatively easy to navigate because each object has a member that references another object. In external database tables, however, navigating relationships is not as straightforward. Database tables do not contain built-in relationships. In these cases, the join operation can be used to match elements from each source. For example, given two tables that contain product information and sales information, you could use a join operation to match sales information and products for the same sales order.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] framework provides two join operators, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A> and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupJoin%2A>. These operators perform *equi-joins*: that is, joins that match two data sources only when their keys are equal. (By contrast, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] supports join operators other than `equals`, such as the `less than` operator.)  \n  \n In relational database terms, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A> implements an inner join. An inner join is a type of join in which only those objects that have a match in the opposite data set are returned.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupJoin%2A> operators have no direct equivalent in relational database terms; they implement a superset of inner joins and left outer joins. A left outer join is a join that returns each element of the first (left) collection, even if it has no correlated elements in the second collection.  \n  \n For more information about joins, see [Join Operations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/442d176d-028c-4beb-8d22-407d4ef89107).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example performs a traditional join of the `SalesOrderHeader` and `SalesOrderDetail` tables from the AdventureWorks sample database to obtain online orders from the month of August.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP LINQ to DataSet Examples#Join](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP LINQ to DataSet Examples/CS/Program.cs#join)]\n [!code-vb[DP LINQ to DataSet Examples#Join](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DP LINQ to DataSet Examples/VB/Module1.vb#join)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Querying DataSets](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/querying-datasets-linq-to-dataset.md)   \n [Single-Table Queries](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/single-table-queries-linq-to-dataset.md)   \n [Querying Typed DataSets](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/querying-typed-datasets.md)   \n [Join Operations](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/442d176d-028c-4beb-8d22-407d4ef89107)   \n [LINQ to DataSet Examples](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/linq-to-dataset-examples.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":"Cross-Table Queries (LINQ to DataSet) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Cross-Table Queries (LINQ to DataSet) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[375,412],"content":"Cross-Table Queries (LINQ to DataSet)","linkify":"Cross-Table Queries (LINQ to DataSet)","nodes":[{"content":"Cross-Table Queries (LINQ to DataSet)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"In addition to querying a single table, you can also perform cross-table queries in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[413,563],"source":"In addition to querying a single table, you can also perform cross-table queries in [!INCLUDE[linq_dataset](../../../../includes/linq-dataset-md.md)]."},{"content":"This is done by using a <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>join<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[564,595],"source":" This is done by using a *join*."},{"content":"A join is the association of objects in one data source with objects that share a common attribute in another data source, such as a product or contact ID.","pos":[596,751]},{"content":"In object-oriented programming, relationships between objects are relatively easy to navigate because each object has a member that references another object.","pos":[752,910]},{"content":"In external database tables, however, navigating relationships is not as straightforward.","pos":[911,1000]},{"content":"Database tables do not contain built-in relationships.","pos":[1001,1055]},{"content":"In these cases, the join operation can be used to match elements from each source.","pos":[1056,1138]},{"content":"For example, given two tables that contain product information and sales information, you could use a join operation to match sales information and products for the same sales order.","pos":[1139,1321]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)]</ph> framework provides two join operators, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupJoin%2A&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1328,1522],"source":"The [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] framework provides two join operators, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A> and <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupJoin%2A>."},{"content":"These operators perform <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>equi-joins<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>: that is, joins that match two data sources only when their keys are equal.","pos":[1523,1635],"source":" These operators perform *equi-joins*: that is, joins that match two data sources only when their keys are equal."},{"content":"(By contrast, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]</ph> supports join operators other than <ph id=\"ph2\">`equals`</ph>, such as the <ph id=\"ph3\">`less than`</ph> operator.)","pos":[1636,1779],"source":" (By contrast, [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)] supports join operators other than `equals`, such as the `less than` operator.)"},{"content":"In relational database terms, <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A&gt;</ph> implements an inner join.","pos":[1786,1879],"source":"In relational database terms, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Join%2A> implements an inner join."},{"content":"An inner join is a type of join in which only those objects that have a match in the opposite data set are returned.","pos":[1880,1996]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupJoin%2A&gt;</ph> operators have no direct equivalent in relational database terms;
