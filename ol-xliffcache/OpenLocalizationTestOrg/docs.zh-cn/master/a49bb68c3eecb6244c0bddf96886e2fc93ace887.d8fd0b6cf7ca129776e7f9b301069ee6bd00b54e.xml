It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value. Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned.  \n  \n Arrays of type <xref:System.Void> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31428  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Remove the parentheses that designate an array.  \n  \n2.  Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Void>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,224],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31428\"\n  - \"bc31428\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31428\"\nms.assetid: 21d77b56-585f-4107-b7ec-21933ba58017","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","nodes":[{"pos":[0,63],"content":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","pos":[0,63]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[231,294],"content":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","linkify":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays of type 'System.Void' are not allowed in this expression","pos":[0,63]}]},{"pos":[295,399],"content":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration specifies an array of type <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>.","source":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration specifies an array of type <xref:System.Void>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++.","pos":[406,544],"source":"The <xref:System.Void> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++."},{"content":"It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value.","pos":[545,621]},{"content":"Visual Basic uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub`</ph> procedure when a value is not returned and a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Function`</ph> procedure when a value is returned.","pos":[622,739],"source":" Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned."},{"pos":[746,834],"content":"Arrays of type <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context.","source":"Arrays of type <xref:System.Void> are not meaningful and are not allowed in any context."},{"pos":[841,862],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31428","source":"**Error ID:** BC31428"},{"pos":[871,892],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the parentheses that designate an array.","pos":[902,949]},{"pos":[959,1083],"content":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>, remove the reference to it altogether.","source":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether."},{"pos":[1092,1100],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
