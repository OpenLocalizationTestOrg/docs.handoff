If an application needs to create a file, that application needs `Create` access for the folder. If the file already exists, the application needs only `Write` access, a lesser privilege. Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant `Read` access to a single file, rather than `Create` access for a folder.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter>   \n [How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-read-object-data-from-an-xml-file.md)   \n [Serialization (C# )](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,74],"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[433,478],"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)","linkify":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (C#)","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"TThis example writes the object from a class to an XML file using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[479,601],"source":"TThis example writes the object from a class to an XML file using the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class."},{"pos":[610,617],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1369,1387],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The class must have a public constructor without parameters.","pos":[1391,1451]},{"pos":[1460,1478],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1482,1530]},{"content":"The class being serialized does not have a public, parameterless constructor.","pos":[1540,1617]},{"content":"The file exists and is read-only (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IOException&gt;</ph>).","pos":[1627,1691],"source":"The file exists and is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException>)."},{"content":"The path is too long (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException&gt;</ph>).","pos":[1701,1762],"source":"The path is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>)."},{"content":"The disk is full (<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IOException&gt;</ph>).","pos":[1772,1820],"source":"The disk is full (<xref:System.IO.IOException>)."},{"pos":[1829,1852],"content":".NET Framework Security","linkify":".NET Framework Security","nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Security","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"This example creates a new file, if the file does not already exist.","pos":[1856,1924]},{"content":"If an application needs to create a file, that application needs <ph id=\"ph1\">`Create`</ph> access for the folder.","pos":[1925,2021],"source":" If an application needs to create a file, that application needs `Create` access for the folder."},{"content":"If the file already exists, the application needs only <ph id=\"ph1\">`Write`</ph> access, a lesser privilege.","pos":[2022,2112],"source":" If the file already exists, the application needs only `Write` access, a lesser privilege."},{"content":"Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant <ph id=\"ph1\">`Read`</ph> access to a single file, rather than <ph id=\"ph2\">`Create`</ph> access for a folder.","pos":[2113,2273],"source":" Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant `Read` access to a single file, rather than `Create` access for a folder."},{"pos":[2282,2290],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.StreamWriter&gt;</ph>","pos":[2294,2323],"source":"<xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-read-object-data-from-an-xml-file.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2327,2482],"source":" [How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-read-object-data-from-an-xml-file.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Serialization (C# )<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)</ept>","pos":[2485,2577],"source":" [Serialization (C# )](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)"}]}
