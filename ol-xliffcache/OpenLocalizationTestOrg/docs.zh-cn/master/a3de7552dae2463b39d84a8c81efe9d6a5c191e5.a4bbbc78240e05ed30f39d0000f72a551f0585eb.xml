The first query uses the <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetFiles%2A> method to populate an array of file names in a directory and all subdirectories. This method does not return until the entire array is populated, and therefore it can introduce latency at the beginning of the operation. However, after the array is populated, PLINQ can process it in parallel very quickly.  \n  \n The second query uses the static <xref:System.IO.Directory.EnumerateDirectories%2A> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles%2A> methods which begin returning results immediately. This approach can be faster when you are iterating over large directory trees, although the processing time compared to the first example can depend on many factors.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  These examples are intended to demonstrate usage, and might not run faster than the equivalent sequential LINQ to Objects query. For more information about speedup, see [Understanding Speedup in PLINQ](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/understanding-speedup-in-plinq.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to iterate over file directories in simple scenarios when you have access to all directories in the tree, the file sizes are not very large, and the access times are not significant. This approach involves a period of latency at the beginning while the array of file names is being constructed.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PLINQ#33](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/plinq/cs/plinqfileiteration.cs#33)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to iterate over file directories in simple scenarios when you have access to all directories in the tree, the file sizes are not very large, and the access times are not significant. This approach begins producing results faster than the previous example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PLINQ#34](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/plinq/cs/plinqfileiteration.cs#34)]  \n  \n When using <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetFiles%2A>, be sure that you have sufficient permissions on all directories in the tree. Otherwise an exception will be thrown and no results will be returned. When using the <xref:System.IO.Directory.EnumerateDirectories%2A> in a PLINQ query, it is problematic to handle I/O exceptions in a graceful way that enables you to continue iterating. If your code must handle I/O or unauthorized access exceptions, then you should consider the approach described in [How to: Iterate File Directories with the Parallel Class](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/how-to-iterate-file-directories-with-the-parallel-class.md).  \n  \n If I/O latency is an issue, for example with file I/O over a network, consider using one of the asynchronous I/O techniques described in [TPL and Traditional .NET Framework Asynchronous Programming](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/tpl-and-traditional-async-programming.md) and in this [blog post](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=186458).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,72],"content":"How to: Iterate File Directories with PLINQ | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Iterate File Directories with PLINQ | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[433,476],"content":"How to: Iterate File Directories with PLINQ","linkify":"How to: Iterate File Directories with PLINQ","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Iterate File Directories with PLINQ","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"This example shows two simple ways to parallelize operations on file directories.","pos":[477,558]},{"content":"The first query uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Directory.GetFiles%2A&gt;</ph> method to populate an array of file names in a directory and all subdirectories.","pos":[559,703],"source":" The first query uses the <xref:System.IO.Directory.GetFiles%2A> method to populate an array of file names in a directory and all subdirectories."},{"content":"This method does not return until the entire array is populated, and therefore it can introduce latency at the beginning of the operation.","pos":[704,842]},{"content":"However, after the array is populated, PLINQ can process it in parallel very quickly.","pos":[843,928]},{"content":"The second query uses the static <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Directory.EnumerateDirectories%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles%2A&gt;</ph> methods which begin returning results immediately.","pos":[935,1122],"source":"The second query uses the static <xref:System.IO.Directory.EnumerateDirectories%2A> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles%2A> methods which begin returning results immediately."},{"content":"This approach can be faster when you are iterating over large directory trees, although the processing time compared to the first example can depend on many factors.","pos":[1123,1288]},{"pos":[1296,1591],"content":"[!WARNING]\n These examples are intended to demonstrate usage, and might not run faster than the equivalent sequential LINQ to Objects query.
