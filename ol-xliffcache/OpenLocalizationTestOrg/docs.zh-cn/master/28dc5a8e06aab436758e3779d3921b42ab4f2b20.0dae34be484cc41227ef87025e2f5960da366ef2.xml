If you want to display data that is not meant for modification, you must make the columns that contain the data read-only. For information about how to make the control entirely read-only, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md).  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu.
