a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/converting-a-nettcpbinding-application-to-a-peer-channel-application.md)  \n Describes hot to convert a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application.  \n  \n [Limiting Message Distribution](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/limiting-message-distribution.md)  \n Discusses using Hop Count, a Message Propagation Filter, a local filter, or a direct connection to control how messages are forwarded throughout the mesh, and provides general guidelines for choosing an approach.  \n  \n [Adding Online and Offline Status](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/adding-online-and-offline-status.md)  \n Describes how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.IOnlineStatus> interface to monitor specific details about the online and offline status of a Peer Channel connection.  \n  \n [Securing Peer Channel Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-peer-channel-applications.md)  \n Discusses transport-based and message-based security, and best practices for securing Peer Channel applications.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Peer Channel Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-channel-concepts.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"Building a Peer
