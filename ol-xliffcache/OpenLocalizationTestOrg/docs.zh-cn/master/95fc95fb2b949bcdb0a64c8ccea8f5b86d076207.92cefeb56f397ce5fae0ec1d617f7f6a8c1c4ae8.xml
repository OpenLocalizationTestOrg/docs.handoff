It is based on the [Self-Host](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145523) sample.  \n  \n### To configure the existing Self-Host service sample for Discovery  \n  \n1.  Open the Self-Host solution in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)]. The sample is located in the TechnologySamples\\Basic\\Service\\Hosting\\SelfHost directory.  \n  \n2.  Add a reference to `System.ServiceModel.Discovery.dll` to the service project. You may see an error message saying \"System. ServiceModel.Discovery.dll or one of its dependencies requires a later version of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] than the one specified in the project …\" If you see this message, right-click the project in the Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**. In the **Project Properties** window, make sure that the **Target Framework** is [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n3.  Open the Service.cs file and add the following `using` statement.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    using System.ServiceModel.Discovery;  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  In the `Main()` method, inside the `using` statement, add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior> instance to the service host.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n        // Create a ServiceHost for the CalculatorService type.  \n        using (ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService)))  \n        {  \n            // Add a ServiceDiscoveryBehavior  \n            serviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(new ServiceDiscoveryBehavior());                  \n  \n            // ...  \n        }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior> specifies that the service it is applied to is discoverable.  \n  \n5.  Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.UdpDiscoveryEndpoint> to the service host right after the code that adds the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.ServiceDiscoveryBehavior>.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Add ServiceDiscoveryBehavior  \n    serviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(new ServiceDiscoveryBehavior());  \n  \n    // Add a UdpDiscoveryEndpoint  \n    serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(new UdpDiscoveryEndpoint());  \n    ```  \n  \n     This code specifies that discovery messages should be sent to the standard UDP discovery endpoint.  \n  \n### To create a client application that uses discovery to call the service  \n  \n1.  Add a new console application to the solution called `DiscoveryClientApp`.  \n  \n2.  Add a reference to `System.ServiceModel.dll` and `System.ServiceModel.Discovery.dll`  \n  \n3.  Copy the GeneratedClient.cs and App.config files from the existing client project to the new DiscoveryClientApp project. To do this, right-click the files in the **Solution Explorer**, select **Copy**, and then select the **DiscoveryClientApp** project, right-click and select **Paste**.  \n  \n4.  Open Program.cs.  \n  \n5.  Add the following `using` statements.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    using System.ServiceModel.Discovery;  \n    using Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples;  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Add a static method called `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()` to the `Program` class.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    static EndpointAddress FindCalculatorServiceAddress()  \n    {  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     This method uses discovery to search for the `CalculatorService` service.  \n  \n7.  Inside the `FindCalculatorServiceAddress` method, create a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> instance, passing in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.UdpDiscoveryEndpoint> to the constructor.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    static EndpointAddress FindCalculatorServiceAddress()  \n    {  \n        // Create DiscoveryClient  \n        DiscoveryClient discoveryClient = new DiscoveryClient(new UdpDiscoveryEndpoint());  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     This tells [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] that the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> class should use the standard UDP discovery endpoint to send and receive discovery messages.  \n  \n8.  On the next line, call the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A> method and specify a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.FindCriteria> instance that contains the service contract you want to search for. In this case, specify `ICalculator`.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Find ICalculatorService endpoints              \n    FindResponse findResponse = discoveryClient.Find(new FindCriteria(typeof(ICalculator)));  \n    ```  \n  \n9. After the call to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient.Find%2A>, check to see if there is at least one matching service and return the <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> of the first matching service. Otherwise return `null`.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    if (findResponse.Endpoints.Count > 0)  \n    {  \n        return findResponse.Endpoints[0].Address;  \n    }  \n    else  \n    {  \n        return null;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n10. Add a static method named `InvokeCalculatorService` to the `Program` class.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    static void InvokeCalculatorService(EndpointAddress endpointAddress)  \n    {  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     This method uses the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress` to call the calculator service.  \n  \n11. Inside the `InvokeCalculatorService` method, create an instance of the `CalculatorServiceClient` class. This class is defined by the [Self-Host](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=145523) sample. It was generated using Svcutil.exe.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Create a client  \n    CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  \n    ```  \n  \n12. On the next line, set the endpoint address of the client to the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()`.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Connect to the discovered service endpoint  \n    client.Endpoint.Address = endpointAddress;  \n    ```  \n  \n13. Immediately after the code for the previous step, call the methods exposed by the calculator service.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Invoking CalculatorService at {0}\", endpointAddress);  \n  \n    double value1 = 100.00D;  \n    double value2 = 15.99D;  \n  \n    // Call the Add service operation.  \n    double result = client.Add(value1, value2);  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Add({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n    // Call the Subtract service operation.  \n    result = client.Subtract(value1, value2);  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n    // Call the Multiply service operation.  \n    result = client.Multiply(value1, value2);  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n    // Call the Divide service operation.  \n    result = client.Divide(value1, value2);  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Divide({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n    Console.WriteLine();  \n  \n    //Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources  \n    client.Close();  \n    ```  \n  \n14. Add code to the `Main()` method in the `Program` class to call `FindCalculatorServiceAddress`.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n        EndpointAddress endpointAddress = FindCalculatorServiceAddress();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n15. On the next line, call the `InvokeCalculatorService()` and pass in the endpoint address returned from `FindCalculatorServiceAddress()`.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    if (endpointAddress != null)  \n    {  \n        InvokeCalculatorService(endpointAddress);  \n    }  \n  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to exit.\");  \n    Console.ReadLine();  \n    ```  \n  \n### To test the application  \n  \n1.  Open an elevated command prompt and run Service.exe.  \n  \n2.  Open a command prompt and run Discoveryclientapp.exe.  \n  \n3.  The output from service.exe should look like the following output.  \n  \n    ```Output  \n    Received Add(100,15.99)  \n    Return: 115.99  \n    Received Subtract(100,15.99)  \n    Return: 84.01  \n    Received Multiply(100,15.99)  \n    Return: 1599  \n    Received Divide(100,15.99)  \n    Return: 6.25390869293308  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  The output from Discoveryclientapp.exe should look like the following output.  \n  \n    ```Output  \n    Invoking CalculatorService at http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service  \n    Add(100,15.99) = 115.99  \n    Subtract(100,15.99) = 84.01  \n    Multiply(100,15.99) = 1599  \n    Divide(100,15.99) = 6.25390869293308  \n  \n    Press <ENTER> to exit.  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following is a listing of the code for this sample.
