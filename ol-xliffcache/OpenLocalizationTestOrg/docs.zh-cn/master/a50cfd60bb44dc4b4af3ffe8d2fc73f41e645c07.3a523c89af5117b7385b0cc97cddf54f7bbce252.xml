This is the appropriate cache behavior for most applications.  \n  \n### To set the default automatic policy for an application  \n  \n1.  Create a default time-based policy object.  \n  \n2.  Set the policy object as the default for the application domain.  \n  \n## Example  \n The two examples in this section produce identical policies.  \n  \n The following example creates a default time-based policy and sets it as the default for the application domain.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic static void SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy ()  \n{  \n    HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy ();  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy ;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Shared Sub SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy ()  \n    Dim policy = New HttpRequestCachePolicy ()  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n You can also create the default time-based cache policy using the <xref:System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy> class as shown in the following example:  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic static void SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy2()  \n{  \n    RequestCachePolicy policy = new RequestCachePolicy ();  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy ;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Shared Sub SetDefaultTimeBasedPolicy2()  \n    Dim policy As New RequestCachePolicy()  \n    HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Cache Management for Network Applications](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-management-for-network-applications.md)\n- [Cache Policy](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-policy.md)\n- [Location-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/location-based-cache-policies.md)\n- [Time-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/time-based-cache-policies.md)\n- [\\<requestCaching> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/requestcaching-element-network-settings.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,326],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Set the Default Time-Based Cache Policy for an Application\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
