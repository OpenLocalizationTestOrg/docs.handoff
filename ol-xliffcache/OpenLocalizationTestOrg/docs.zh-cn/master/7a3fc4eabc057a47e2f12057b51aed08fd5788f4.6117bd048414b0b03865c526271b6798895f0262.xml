There are three reasons to group controls. One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.

Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control from the **Windows Forms** tab of the Toolbox onto a form.  \n  \n2.  Add other controls to the panel, drawing each inside the panel.  \n  \n     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a panel, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, and then paste them into the panel. You can also drag them into the panel.  \n  \n3.  (Optional) If you want to add a border to a panel, set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle> property. There are three choices: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Panel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [Panel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,594],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,95],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,95]}]}],"pos":[6,104],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Panel control [Windows Forms], grouping controls\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], grouping\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, grouping\"\nms.assetid: 7e1cd708-fdb1-49d8-9ca2-5640b276bf2e\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[601,679],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,78]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> controls are used to group other controls.","pos":[680,770],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to group other controls."},{"content":"There are three reasons to group controls.","pos":[771,813]},{"content":"One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.","pos":[814,1015]},{"pos":[1023,1399],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
