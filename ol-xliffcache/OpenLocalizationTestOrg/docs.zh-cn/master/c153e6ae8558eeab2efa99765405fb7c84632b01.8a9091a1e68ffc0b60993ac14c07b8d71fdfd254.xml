The host must return immediately, because the call is made asynchronously. If the host cannot alert the task immediately, it must wake up the next time it enters a state in which it can be alerted.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  `Alert` affects only those tasks to which the runtime has passed a [WAIT_OPTION](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/wait-option-enumeration.md) value of WAIT_ALERTABLE to methods such as
