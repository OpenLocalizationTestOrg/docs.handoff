This topic provides an overview of the functionality in the              <xref:System.Windows.Application> class for creating and managing applications.  \n   \n  \n## The Application Class  \n In                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], common application-scoped functionality is encapsulated in the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class. The                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class includes the following functionality:  \n  \n-   Tracking and interacting with application lifetime.  \n  \n-   Retrieving and processing command-line parameters.  \n  \n-   Detecting and responding to unhandled exceptions.  \n  \n-   Sharing application-scope properties and resources.  \n  \n-   Managing windows in standalone applications.  \n  \n-   Tracking and managing navigation.  \n  \n<a name=\"The_Application_Class\"></a>   \n## How to Perform Common Tasks Using the Application Class  \n If you are not interested in all of the details of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class, t                 he following table                  lists some of the common tasks for                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> and how to accomplish them. By viewing the related API and topics, you can find more information and sample code.  \n  \n|Task|Approach|  \n|----------|--------------|  \n|Get an object that represents the current application|Use the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.|  \n|Add a startup screen to an application|See                                  [Add a Splash Screen to a WPF Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-add-a-splash-screen-to-a-wpf-application.md).|  \n|Start an application|Use the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Run%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.|  \n|Stop an application|Use the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Shutdown%2A> method of the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A?displayProperty=fullName> object.|  \n|Get arguments from the command line|Handle the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Startup?displayProperty=fullName> event and use the                                  <xref:System.Windows.StartupEventArgs.Args%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property.

A                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application definition is a class that derives from                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> and is configured with a special                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] setting.  \n  \n### Implementing an Application Definition  \n A typical                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application definition is implemented using both markup and code-behind. This allows you to use markup to declaratively set application properties, resources, and register events, while handling events and implementing application-specific behavior in code-behind.  \n  \n The following example shows how to implement an application definition using both markup and code-behind:  \n  \n [!code-xml[ApplicationSnippets#ApplicationXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml#applicationxaml)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ApplicationSnippets#ApplicationCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml.cs#applicationcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[ApplicationSnippets#ApplicationCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationSnippets/visualbasic/application.xaml.vb#applicationcodebehind)]  \n  \n To allow a markup file and code-behind file to work together, the following needs to happen:  \n  \n-   In markup, the                                  `Application` element must include the                                  `x:Class` attribute. When the application is built, the existence of                                  `x:Class` in the markup file causes                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] to create a                                  `partial` class that derives from                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> and has the name that is specified by the                                  `x:Class` attribute. This requires the addition of an                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] namespace declaration for the                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] schema (                                  `xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"` ).  \n  \n-   In code-behind, the class must be a                                  `partial` class with the same name that is specified by the                                  `x:Class` attribute in markup and must derive from                                  <xref:System.Windows.Application>. This allows the code-behind file to be associated with the                                  `partial` class that is generated for the markup file when the application is built (see                                  [Building a WPF Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/building-a-wpf-application-wpf.md)).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When you create a new WPF Application project or WPF Browser Application project using                              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)], an application definition is included by default and is defined using both markup and code-behind.  \n  \n This code is the minimum that is required to implement an application definition. However, an additional                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] configuration needs to be made to the application definition before building and running the application.  \n  \n### Configuring the Application Definition for MSBuild  \n Standalone applications and                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] require the implementation of a certain level of infrastructure before they can run. The most important part of this infrastructure is the entry point. When an application is launched by a user, the operating system calls the entry point, which is a well-known function for starting applications.  \n  \n Traditionally, developers have needed to write some or all of this code for themselves, depending on the technology. However,                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] generates this code for you when the markup file of your application definition is configured as an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`ApplicationDefinition` item, as shown in the following                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] project file:  \n  \n```  \n<Project   \n  DefaultTargets=\"Build\"  \n                        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\">  \n  ...  \n  <ApplicationDefinition Include=\"App.xaml\" />  \n  <Compile Include=\"App.xaml.cs\" />  \n  ...  \n</Project>  \n  \n```  \n  \n Because the code-behind file contains code, it is marked as an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`Compile` item, as is normal.  \n  \n The application of these                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] configurations to the markup and code-behind files of an application definition causes                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] to generate code like the following:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[AppDefAugSnippets#AppDefAugCODE1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/AppDefAugSnippets/CSharp/App.cs#appdefaugcode1)]\n [!code-vb[AppDefAugSnippets#AppDefAugCODE1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/AppDefAugSnippets/VisualBasic/App.vb#appdefaugcode1)]  \n[!code-csharp[AppDefAugSnippets#AppDefAugCODE2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/AppDefAugSnippets/CSharp/App.cs#appdefaugcode2)]\n[!code-vb[AppDefAugSnippets#AppDefAugCODE2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/AppDefAugSnippets/VisualBasic/App.vb#appdefaugcode2)]  \n  \n The resulting code augments your application definition with additional infrastructure code, which includes the entry-point method                          `Main`. The                          <xref:System.STAThreadAttribute> attribute is applied to the                          `Main` method to indicate that the main                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] thread for the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application is an STA thread, which is required for                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications. When called,                          `Main` creates a new instance of                          `App` before calling the                          `InitializeComponent` method to register the events and set the properties that are implemented in markup. Because                          `InitializeComponent` is generated for you, you don't need to explicitly call                          `InitializeComponent` from an application definition like you do for                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> implementations. Finally, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.Run%2A> method is called to start the application.  \n  \n<a name=\"Getting_the_Current_Application\"></a>   \n## Getting the Current Application  \n Because the functionality of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class are shared across an application, there can be only one instance of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class per                  <xref:System.AppDomain>. To enforce this, the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class is implemented as a singleton class (see                  [Implementing Singleton in C#](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100567)), which creates a single instance of itself and provides shared access to it with the                  `static`<xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A> property.  \n  \n The following code shows how to acquire a reference to the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> object for the current                  <xref:System.AppDomain>.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets#GetCurrentAppCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml.cs#getcurrentappcode)]\n [!code-vb[ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets#GetCurrentAppCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets/VisualBasic/MainWindow.xaml.vb#getcurrentappcode)]  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A> returns a reference to an instance of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class. If you want a reference to your                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> derived class you must cast the value of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A> property, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets#GetSTCurrentAppCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml.cs#getstcurrentappcode)]\n [!code-vb[ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets#GetSTCurrentAppCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationManagementOverviewSnippets/VisualBasic/MainWindow.xaml.vb#getstcurrentappcode)]  \n  \n You can inspect the value of                  <xref:System.Windows.Application.Current%2A> at any point in the lifetime of an                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> object. However, you should be careful. After the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> class is instantiated, there is a period during which the state of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> object is inconsistent. During this period,                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> is performing the various initialization tasks that are required by your code to run, including establishing application infrastructure, setting properties, and registering events. If you try to use the                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> object during this period, your code may have unexpected results, particularly if it depends on the various                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> properties being set.  \n  \n When                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> completes its initialization work, its lifetime truly begins.  \n  \n<a name=\"Application_Lifetime\"></a>   \n## Application Lifetime  \n The lifetime of a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] application is marked by several events that are raised by                  <xref:System.Windows.Application> to let you know when your application has started, has been activated and deactivated, and has been shut down.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"Splash_Screen\"></a>   \n### Splash Screen  \n Starting in                          the                         [!INCLUDE[net_v35SP1_short](../../../../includes/net-v35sp1-short-md.md)], you can specify an image to be used in a startup window, or                          *splash screen*.

In this case, the application may not have the code to detect and process the exception. This type of exception is an unhandled exception; a notification similar to that shown in the following figure is displayed before the application is closed.  \n  \n ![Unhandled exception notification](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/applicationmanagementoverviewfigure2.png \"ApplicationManagementOverviewFigure2\")  \n  \n From the user experience perspective, it is better for an application to avoid this default behavior by doing some or all of the following:  \n  \n-   Displaying user-friendly information.  \n  \n-   Attempting to keep an application running.  \n  \n-   Recording detailed, developer-friendly, exception information in the                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mswin](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mswin-md.md)] event log.  \n  \n Implementing this support depends on being able to detect unhandled exceptions, which is what the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException> event is raised for.  \n  \n [!code-xml[ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets#HandleDispatcherUnhandledExceptionXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml#handledispatcherunhandledexceptionxaml)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets#HandleDispatcherUnhandledExceptionCODEBEHIND1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml.cs#handledispatcherunhandledexceptioncodebehind1)]\n [!code-vb[ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets#HandleDispatcherUnhandledExceptionCODEBEHIND1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets/visualbasic/application.xaml.vb#handledispatcherunhandledexceptioncodebehind1)]  \n[!code-csharp[ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets#HandleDispatcherUnhandledExceptionCODEBEHIND2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml.cs#handledispatcherunhandledexceptioncodebehind2)]\n[!code-vb[ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets#HandleDispatcherUnhandledExceptionCODEBEHIND2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ApplicationDispatcherUnhandledExceptionSnippets/visualbasic/application.xaml.vb#handledispatcherunhandledexceptioncodebehind2)]  \n  \n The                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException> event handler is passed a                          <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs> parameter that contains contextual information regarding the unhandled exception, including the exception itself (                         <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.Exception%2A?displayProperty=fullName>). You can use this information to determine how to handle the exception.  \n  \n When you handle                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException>, you should set the                          <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.Handled%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to                          `true`; otherwise,                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] still considers the exception to be unhandled and reverts to the default behavior described earlier. If an unhandled exception is raised and either the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException> event is not handled, or the event is handled and                          <xref:System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs.Handled%2A> is set to                          `false`, the application shuts down immediately. Furthermore, no other                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> events are raised. Consequently, you need to handle                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.DispatcherUnhandledException> if your application has code that must run before the application shuts down.  \n  \n Although an application may shut down as a result of an unhandled exception, an application usually shuts down in response to a user request, as discussed in the next section.  \n  \n<a name=\"Application_Lifetime_Events\"></a>   \n### Application Lifetime Events  \n Standalone applications and                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] don't have exactly the same lifetimes.
