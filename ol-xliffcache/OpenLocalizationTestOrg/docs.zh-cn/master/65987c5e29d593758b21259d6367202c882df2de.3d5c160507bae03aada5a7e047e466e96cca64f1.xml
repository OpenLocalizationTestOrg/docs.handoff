Microsoft Internet Explorer accepts this as an alternative to the `<?xml-stylesheet?>` syntax. When the XML data contains an `<?xml:stylesheet?>` directive, as shown in the following data, attempting to load this data into the XML Document Object Model (DOM) throws an exception.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n<?xml:stylesheet type=\"text/xsl\" href=\"test2.xsl\"?>\n<root>\n    <test>Node 1</test>\n    <test>Node 2</test>\n</root>\n```\n\nThis occurs because the `<?xml:stylesheet?>` is considered an invalid **ProcessingInstruction** to the DOM. Any **ProcessingInstruction**, according to the Namespaces in XML specification, can only be no-colon names (NCNames), as opposed to qualified names (QNames).\n\nFrom Section 6 of the Namespaces in XML specification, the effect of having the **Load** and **LoadXml** methods conform to the specification is that in a document:\n\n- All element types and attribute names contain either zero or one colon.\n\n- No entity names, ProcessingInstruction targets, or notation names contain any colons.\n\nWith the `<?xml:stylesheet?>` containing a colon, you now violate the rule in the second bullet.\n\nAccording to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Associating Style Sheets with XML documents Version 1.0 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-stylesheet/),  the processing instruction to associate an XSLT style sheet with an XML document is `<?xml-stylesheet?>`, with a dash replacing the colon.\n\n## See also\n\n- [XML Document Object Model
