To tile the interior of a shape, use a texture brush. When you construct a <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object, one of the arguments you pass to the constructor is an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object. When you use the texture brush to paint the interior of a shape, the shape is filled with repeated copies of this image.  \n  \n The wrap mode property of the <xref:System.Drawing.TextureBrush> object determines how the image is oriented as it is repeated in a rectangular grid. You can make all the tiles in the grid have the same orientation, or you can make the image flip from one grid position to the next. The flipping can be horizontal, vertical, or both. The following examples demonstrate tiling with different types of flipping.  \n  \n### To tile an image  \n  \n-   This example uses the following 75×75 image to tile a 200×200 rectangle.  \n  \n ![Tile 1](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/tile1.gif \"tile1\")  \n  \n-   The following illustration shows how the rectangle is tiled with the image. Note that all tiles have the same orientation; there is no flipping.  \n  \n ![Tile 2](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/tile2.gif \"tile2\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#31](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#31](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n### To flip an image horizontally while tiling  \n  \n-   This example uses the same 75×75 image to fill a 200×200 rectangle.
