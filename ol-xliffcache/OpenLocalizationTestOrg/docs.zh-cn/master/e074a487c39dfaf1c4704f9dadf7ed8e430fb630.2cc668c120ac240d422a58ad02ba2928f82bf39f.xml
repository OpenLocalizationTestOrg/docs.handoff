These protocol classes are built on top of the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket?displayProperty=nameWithType> class and take care of the details of transferring data.  \n  \n The protocol classes use the synchronous methods of the **Socket** class to provide simple and straightforward access to network services without the overhead of maintaining state information or knowing the details of setting up protocol-specific sockets. To use asynchronous **Socket** methods, you can use the asynchronous methods supplied by the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream> class. To access features of the **Socket** class not exposed by the protocol classes, you must use the **Socket** class.  \n  \n **TcpClient** and **TcpListener** represent the network using the **NetworkStream** class. You use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient.GetStream%2A> method to return the network stream, and then call the stream's <xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream.Read%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream.Write%2A> methods. The **NetworkStream** does not own the protocol classes' underlying socket, so closing it does not affect the socket.  \n  \n The **UdpClient** class uses an array of bytes to hold the UDP datagram. You use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient.Send%2A> method to send the data to the network and the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient.Receive%2A> method to receive an incoming datagram.  \n  \n##
