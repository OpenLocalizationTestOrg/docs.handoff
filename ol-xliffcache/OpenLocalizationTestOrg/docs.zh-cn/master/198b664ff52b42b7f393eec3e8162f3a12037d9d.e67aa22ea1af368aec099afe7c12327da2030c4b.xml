The topics in this section describe this programming model for syndication in detail.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [WCF Syndication Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-syndication-overview.md)  \n Provides an overview of syndication support provided by WCF.  \n  \n [Architecture of Syndication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/architecture-of-syndication.md)  \n Describes the classes in the object model and the extensibility of syndication.  \n  \n [How the WCF Syndication Object Model Maps to Atom and RSS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-the-wcf-syndication-object-model-maps-to-atom-and-rss.md)  \n Describes how feeds are represented within the WCF Syndication Object Model and how they are converted to RSS and Atom feeds.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Basic RSS Feed](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-rss-feed.md)  \n Shows how to create a service that makes a basic RSS feed available.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Basic Atom Feed](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-atom-feed.md)  \n Shows how to create a service that makes a basic ATOM feed available.  \n  \n [How to: Expose a Feed as Both Atom and RSS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-expose-a-feed-as-both-atom-and-rss.md)  \n Shows how to create a service that makes the same feed available with ATOM and RSS.  \n  \n [Syndication Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/syndication-extensibility.md)  \n Describes the methods of adding custom elements and attributes to a syndication feed.  \n  \n## Reference  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-model.md)\n- [Partial Trust](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,145],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"WCF Syndication\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
