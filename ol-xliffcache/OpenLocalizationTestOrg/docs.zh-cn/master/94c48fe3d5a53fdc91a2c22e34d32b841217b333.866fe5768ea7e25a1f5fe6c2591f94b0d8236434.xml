The following procedures show how to ensure durable communication between a client and a service by using the standard queued binding when implementing the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n This section explains how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> for queued communication between a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client and a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n### To use queuing in a WCF service  \n  \n1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>. Mark the operations in the interface that are part of the service contract with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> and specify them as one-way because no response to the method is returned. The following code provides an example service contract and its operation definition.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#1)]  \n  \n2.  When the service contract passes user-defined types, you must define data contracts for those types. The following code shows two data contracts, `PurchaseOrder` and `PurchaseOrderLineItem`. These two types define data that is sent to the service. (Note that the classes that define this data contract also define a number of methods. These methods are not considered part of the data contract. Only those members that are declared with the `DataMember` attribute are part of the data contract.)  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  Implement the methods of the service contract defined in the interface in a class.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/service.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/service.vb#3)]  \n  \n     Notice the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationBehaviorAttribute> placed on the `SubmitPurchaseOrder` method. This specifies that this operation must be called within a transaction and that the transaction automatically completes when the method completes.  \n  \n4.  Create a transactional queue using <xref:System.Messaging>. You can choose to create the queue using Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) Microsoft Management Console (MMC) instead. If so, make sure you create a transactional queue.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/hostapp.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/hostapp.vb#4)]  \n  \n5.  Define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> in configuration that specifies the service address and uses the standard <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> binding. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] configuration, see [Configuring Windows Communication Foundation Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/13cb368e-88d4-4c61-8eed-2af0361c6d7a).  \n  \n  \n  \n6.  Create a host for the `OrderProcessing` service using <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> that reads messages from the queue and processes them. Open the service host to make the service available. Display a message that tells the user to press any key to terminate the service. Call `ReadLine` to wait for the key to be pressed and then close the service.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/hostapp.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[S_Msmq_Transacted#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/vb/hostapp.vb#6)]  \n  \n### To create a client for the queued service  \n  \n1.  The following example shows how to run the hosting application and use the Svcutil.exe tool to create the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client.  \n  \n    ```  \n    svcutil http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/service  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Define a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> in configuration that specifies the address and uses the standard <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> binding, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n  \n  \n3.  Create a transaction scope to write to the transactional queue, call the `SubmitPurchaseOrder` operation and close the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[S_Msmq_Transacted#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_msmq_transacted/cs/client.cs#8)]\n
