Core](../../core/index.md):\n\n* [Console Application](console-teleprompter.md): demonstrates Console I/O, the structure of a Console application, and\nthe basics of the Task based asynchronous programming model.\n* [REST Client](console-webapiclient.md): demonstrates web communications, JSON serialization, and Object Oriented\nfeatures in the C# language.\n\n* [Inheritance in C# and .NET](inheritance.md): demonstrates inheritance in C#, including the use of inheritance to define base classes, abstract base classes, and derived classes.\n\n* [Working with LINQ](working-with-linq.md): demonstrates many of the features of LINQ and the language elements that support it.\n\n* [Microservices hosted in Docker](microservices.md): demonstrates building an ASP.NET Core microservice and hosting it in Docker.\n\n* [Inheritance](inheritance.md): demonstrates how class and interface inheritance provide code reuse in C#.\n\n* [String Interpolation](string-interpolation.md): demonstrates many of the uses for the `$` string interpolation in C#.\n\n* [Using Attributes](attributes.md): how to create and use attributes in C#.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,23],"content":"C# Tutorials","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"C# Tutorials","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[37,49],"content":"C#
