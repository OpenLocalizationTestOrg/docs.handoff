\n|`CHAIN_NONE`|No call chain has been initiated.|  \n|`CHAIN_CLASS_INIT`|The chain was initiated by a constructor.|  \n|`CHAIN_EXCEPTION_FILTER`|The chain was initiated by an exception filter.|  \n|`CHAIN_SECURITY`|The chain was initiated by code that enforces security.|  \n|`CHAIN_CONTEXT_POLICY`|The chain was initiated by a context policy.|  \n|`CHAIN_INTERCEPTION`|Not used.|  \n|`CHAIN_PROCESS_START`|Not used.|  \n|`CHAIN_THREAD_START`|The chain was initiated by the start of a thread execution.|  \n|`CHAIN_ENTER_MANAGED`|The chain was initiated by entry into managed code.|  \n|`CHAIN_ENTER_UNMANAGED`|The chain was initiated by entry into unmanaged code.|  \n|`CHAIN_DEBUGGER_EVAL`|Not used.|  \n|`CHAIN_CONTEXT_SWITCH`|Not used.|  \n|`CHAIN_FUNC_EVAL`|The chain was initiated by a function evaluation.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Use the [ICorDebugChain::GetReason](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugchain-getreason-method.md) method to ascertain the reasons for the initiation of a call chain.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n
