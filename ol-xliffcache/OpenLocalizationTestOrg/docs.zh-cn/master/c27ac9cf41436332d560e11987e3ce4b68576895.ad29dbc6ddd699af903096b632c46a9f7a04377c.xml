This role has read and write access to public views and execution rights to stored procedures that are involved in creating, loading and saving instances.  \n  \n-   **System.Activities.DurableInstancing.InstanceStoreObservers**. This role has read-only access to public views.  \n  \n-   **System.Activities.DurableInstancing.WorkflowActivationUsers**. This role has execution rights to stored procedures that are involved in the instance activation process. For more information about instance activation, see [Instance Activation](instance-activation.md). The user account under which a generic host (such as the Workflow Management Service of [!INCLUDE[dublin](../../../includes/dublin-md.md)]) runs should be added to this database role.  \n  \n For more information about security for persistence stores with Windows Server App Fabric, see [Security Configuration for Persistence Stores in App Fabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201208)  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  A client that has access to its own instance data in the instance store has access to all other instances in the same instance store.
