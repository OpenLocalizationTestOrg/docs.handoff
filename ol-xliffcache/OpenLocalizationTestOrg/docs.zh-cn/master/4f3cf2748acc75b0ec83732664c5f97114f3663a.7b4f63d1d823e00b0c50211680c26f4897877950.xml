A service can optionally announce its availability by sending an online and offline announcement message when it is opened or closed respectively. A Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service specifies the announcement endpoints in the [\\<serviceDiscovery>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicediscovery.md) element and uses the AnnouncementClient to perform the announcements. A client wishing to listen for the announcement from other service is actually acting as a WCF service; thus you have to configure the announcement endpoints for that client in the [\\<services>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/services.md) section.  \n  \n\\<system.ServiceModel>  \n\\<standardEndpoints>  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```xml  \n<system.serviceModel>\n  <standardEndpoints>\n    <announcementEndpoint>\n      <standardEndpoint discoveryVersion=\"WSDiscovery11/WSDiscoveryApril2005\"\n                        maxAnnouncementDelay=\"Timespan\"\n                        name=\"String\" />\n    </announcementEndpoint>\n  </standardEndpoints>\n</system.serviceModel>\n```  \n  \n## Attributes and Elements  \n The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  \n  \n### Attributes  \n  \n|Attribute|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|discoveryVersion|A string that specifies one of the two versions of WS-Discovery protocol. Valid values are WSDiscovery11 and WSDiscoveryApril2005. This value is of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.Configuration.AnnouncementEndpointElement.DiscoveryVersion>.|  \n|maxAnnouncementDelay|A Timespan value that specifies the maximum value for the delay the Discovery protocol will wait before sending a Hello message. The messages will wait for a random time value between 0 and the value of this attribute before being sent. This attribute is used to set a small, random delay to prevent network storms when a network goes out and all services come back online at the same time.|  \n|name|A String that specifies the name of the configuration of the standard endpoint. The name is used in the `endpointConfiguration` attribute of the service endpoint to link a standard endpoint to its configuration.|  \n  \n### Child Elements  \n None.  \n  \n### Parent Elements  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|[\\<standardEndpoints>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/standardendpoints.md)|A collection of standard endpoints that are pre-defined endpoints with one or more of their properties (address, binding, contract) fixed.|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates a client listening for announcements messages over http and peernet.  \n  \n```xml  \n<services>\n  <service name=\"ServiceAnnouncementListener\">\n    <endpoint name=\"httpAnnouncementEndpoint\"\n              kind=\"announcementEndpoint\"\n              binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"\n              address=\"announcements\" />\n    <endpoint name=\"peerNetAnnouncementEndpoint\"\n              kind=\"announcementEndpoint\"\n              binding=\"peerTcpBinding\"\n              address=\"net.p2p://discoveryMesh/multicast\"\n              bindingConfiguration=\"discoveryPeerTcpBindingConfig\" />\n  ...\n  </service>\n</services>\n\n<standardEndpoints>\n  <announcementEndpoint>\n    <standardEndpoint name=\"httpAnnouncementEndpoint\"\n                      version=\"WSDiscoveryApril2005\" />\n    <standardEndpoint name=\"peerNetAnnouncementEndpoint\"\n                      version=\"WSDiscoveryApril2005\" />\n  </announcementEndpoint>\n</standardEndpoints>\n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.AnnouncementEndpoint>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,106],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"<announcementEndpoint>\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 034b7c69-a770-4502-8cef-38007bbcd025","nodes":[{"content":"<announcementEndpoint>","nodes":[],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[113,136],"content":"\\<announcementEndpoint>","linkify":"\\<announcementEndpoint>","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>announcementEndpoint&gt;","pos":[0,23],"source":"\\<announcementEndpoint>"}]},{"content":"This configuration element defines a standard endpoint with a fixed announcement contract.","pos":[137,227]},{"content":"A service can optionally announce its availability by sending an online and offline announcement message when it is opened or closed respectively.","pos":[228,374]},{"content":"A Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service specifies the announcement endpoints in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>serviceDiscovery&gt;<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicediscovery.md)</ept> element and uses the AnnouncementClient to perform the announcements.","pos":[375,641],"source":" A Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service specifies the announcement endpoints in the [\\<serviceDiscovery>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicediscovery.md) element and uses the AnnouncementClient to perform the announcements."},{"content":"A client wishing to listen for the announcement from other service is actually acting as a WCF service;
