A hit test is then performed on the rendered content of each drawing in the <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingGroup> to determine which geometry was hit.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In most cases, you would use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualTreeHelper.HitTest%2A> method to determine whether a point intersects any of the rendered content of a visual.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[VisualsOverview#VisualsOverviewSnippet4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsOverview/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#visualsoverviewsnippet4)]\n [!code-vb[VisualsOverview#VisualsOverviewSnippet4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsOverview/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#visualsoverviewsnippet4)]  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.FillContains%2A> method is an overloaded method that allows you to hit test by using a specified <xref:System.Windows.Point> or <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry>. If a geometry is stroked, the stroke can extend outside the fill bounds. In which case, you may want to call <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.StrokeContains%2A> in addition to <xref:System.Windows.Media.Geometry.FillContains%2A>.  \n  \n You can also provide a <xref:System.Windows.Media.ToleranceType> that is used for the purposes of Bezier flattening.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This sample does not take into account any transforms or clipping that may be applied to the geometry. In addition, this sample will not work with a styled control, since it does not have any drawings directly associated with it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Hit Testing in the Visual
