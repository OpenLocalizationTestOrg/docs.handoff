By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> property is initialized with an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary> type. You use this instance when you get and set application-scope properties using <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A>. For more information, see [How to: Get and Set an Application-Scope Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/aa348547(v=vs.100)).\n  \n If you have multiple resources that you set using <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A>, you can instead use a custom resource dictionary to store those resources and set <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> with it instead. The following shows how you declare a custom resource dictionary using XAML.\n  \n [!code-xaml[HOWTOResourceDictionaries#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HowToResourceDictionaries/CSharp/MyResourceDictionary.xaml#1)]  \n  \n Swapping entire resource dictionaries using <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> allows you to support application-scope themes, where each theme is encapsulated by a single resource dictionary. The following example shows how to set the <xref:System.Windows.ResourceDictionary>.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[HOWTOResourceDictionaries#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HowToResourceDictionaries/CSharp/App.xaml#2)]  \n  \n The following shows how you can get application-scope resources from the resource dictionary exposed by <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> in XAML.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[HOWTOResourceDictionaries#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HowToResourceDictionaries/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml#4)]  \n  \n The following shows how you can also get the resources in code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HOWTOResourceDictionaries#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HowToResourceDictionaries/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[HOWTOResourceDictionaries#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HowToResourceDictionaries/VB/MainWindow.xaml.vb#3)]  \n  \n There are two considerations to make when using <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A>. First, the dictionary *key* is an object, so you must use exactly the same object instance when both setting and getting a property value. (Note that the key is case-sensitive when using a string.) Second, the dictionary *value* is an object, so you will have to convert the value to the desired type when getting a property value.  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
