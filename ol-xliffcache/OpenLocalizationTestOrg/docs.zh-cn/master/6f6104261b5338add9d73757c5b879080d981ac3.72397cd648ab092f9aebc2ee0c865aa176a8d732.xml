The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property helps you size the controls to fit larger or smaller captions, which is particularly useful if the caption will change at run time.  \n  \n### To make a label control resize dynamically to fit its contents  \n  \n1.  Set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.AutoSize%2A> is set to `false`, the words specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.Text%2A> property will wrap to the next line if possible, but the control will not grow.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)   \n [Label Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [Label Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/label-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,606],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,79],"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,79]}]}],"pos":[6,88],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
