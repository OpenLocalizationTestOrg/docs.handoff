Such problems include:  \n  \n-   Client token cannot be read from the message.  \n  \n-   Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  \n  \n-   Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  \n  \n-   The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  \n  \n-   A decryption failure has occurred.  \n  \n-   Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  \n  \n-   Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.  \n  \n This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:  \n  \n (N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,152],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 89a70b90-d7e4-4b03-9b84-4dc88ce3d605","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,68]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[159,227],"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","linkify":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[0,68]}]},{"content":"Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures Per Second","pos":[228,300]},{"pos":[309,320],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the \"Security Calls Not Authorized\" counter.","pos":[324,468]},{"content":"Such problems include:","pos":[469,491]},{"content":"Client token cannot be read from the message.","pos":[501,546]},{"content":"Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).","pos":[556,623]},{"content":"Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).","pos":[633,712]},{"content":"The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.","pos":[722,810]},{"content":"A decryption failure has occurred.","pos":[820,854]},{"content":"Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.","pos":[864,973]},{"content":"Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.","pos":[983,1036]},{"pos":[1043,1212],"content":"This counter is of performance counter type <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649)</ept>, whose value is calculated using the following formula:","source":"This counter is of performance counter type [PERF_COUNTER_COUNTER](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=94649), whose value is calculated using the following formula:"},{"content":"(N1-N0)/((D1-D0)/F)","pos":[1219,1238]}]}
