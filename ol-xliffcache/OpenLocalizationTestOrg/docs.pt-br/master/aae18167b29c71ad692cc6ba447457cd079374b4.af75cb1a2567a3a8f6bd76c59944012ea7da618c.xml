New folders can also be created from within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To select files, instead of folders, use the [OpenFileDialog](openfiledialog-component-windows-forms.md) component.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component is displayed at run time using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.RootFolder%2A> property to determine the top-most folder and any subfolders that will appear within the tree view of the dialog box. Once the dialog box has been shown, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.SelectedPath%2A> property to get the path of the folder that was selected.  \n  \n When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog>\n- [How to: Choose Folders with the Windows Forms FolderBrowserDialog Component](how-to-choose-folders-with-the-windows-forms-folderbrowserdialog-component.md)\n- [FolderBrowserDialog Component](folderbrowserdialog-component-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,413],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"FolderBrowserDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  -
