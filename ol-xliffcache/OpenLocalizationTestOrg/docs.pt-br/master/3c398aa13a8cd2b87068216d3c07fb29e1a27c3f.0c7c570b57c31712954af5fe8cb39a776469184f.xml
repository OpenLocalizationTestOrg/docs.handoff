If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times. Both issues will drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,143],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 4abe01f0-6398-4fba-b2f3-c054b7f7e971","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[150,209],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","linkify":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.CommitMessageRetry","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"A commit message retry was sent to an unresponsive participant.","pos":[210,273]},{"pos":[282,293],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Traced if the local Transaction Manager needed to resend a Commit message to a subordinate participant because it did not receive a response in a given amount of time.","pos":[297,464]},{"pos":[473,488],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Investigate potential network or product issues that prevent the response from being delivered on time.","pos":[492,595]},{"content":"If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times.","pos":[597,707]},{"content":"Both issues will drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.","pos":[708,793]},{"pos":[802,810],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[814,887],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[890,1043],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[1046,1134],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
