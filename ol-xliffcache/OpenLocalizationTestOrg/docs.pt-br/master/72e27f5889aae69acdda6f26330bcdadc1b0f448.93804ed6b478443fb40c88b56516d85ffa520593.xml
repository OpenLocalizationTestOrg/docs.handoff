Lines, Curves, and Shapes\nThe vector graphics portion of [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is used to draw lines, draw curves, and to draw and fill shapes.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Vector Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/vector-graphics-overview.md)  \n Discusses vector graphics.  \n  \n [Pens, Lines, and Rectangles in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/pens-lines-and-rectangles-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses drawing lines and rectangles.  \n  \n [Ellipses and Arcs in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/ellipses-and-arcs-in-gdi.md)  \n Defines arcs and ellipses and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  \n  \n [Polygons in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/polygons-in-gdi.md)  \n Defines polygons and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  \n  \n [Cardinal Splines in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/cardinal-splines-in-gdi.md)  \n Defines cardinal splines and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  \n  \n [Bézier Splines in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/bezier-splines-in-gdi.md)  \n Defines Bezier splines and identifies the classes needed to draw them.  \n  \n [Graphics Paths in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-paths-in-gdi.md)  \n Describes paths and how to create and draw them.  \n  \n [Brushes and Filled Shapes in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/brushes-and-filled-shapes-in-gdi.md)  \n Describes brush types and how to use them.  \n  \n [Open and Closed Curves in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/open-and-closed-curves-in-gdi.md)  \n Defines open and closed curves and how to draw and fill them.  \n  \n [Regions in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/regions-in-gdi.md)  \n Describes the methods associated with regions.  \n  \n [Restricting the Drawing Surface in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/restricting-the-drawing-surface-in-gdi.md)  \n Describes clipping and how to use it.  \n  \n [Antialiasing with Lines and Curves](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/antialiasing-with-lines-and-curves.md)  \n Defines antialiasing and how use antialiasing when drawing lines and curves.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Lines, Curves, and Shapes | Microsoft
