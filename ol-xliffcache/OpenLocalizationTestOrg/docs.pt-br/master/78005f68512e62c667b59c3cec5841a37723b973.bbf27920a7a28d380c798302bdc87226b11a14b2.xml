Service metadata includes descriptions of the service endpoints, bindings, contracts, operations, and messages. You can use service metadata for a variety of purposes, including automatically generating a client for consuming the service, implementing the service description, and dynamically updating the binding for a client.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Understanding Generated Client Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-generated-client-code.md)  \n Describes the different classes and interfaces the Svcutil.exe tool generates.  \n  \n [How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to retrieve metadata using Svcutil.exe and implement a compliant service.  \n  \n [Generating a WCF Client from Service Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/generating-a-wcf-client-from-service-metadata.md)  \n Demonstrates how to retrieve metadata using Svcutil.exe and generate a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/metadata.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,98],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using Metadata\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 05cf53a1-b92d-4d8e-a87e-79f6e51c4a8d","nodes":[{"content":"Using Metadata","nodes":[{"pos":[0,14],"content":"Using Metadata","nodes":[{"content":"Using Metadata","pos":[0,14]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[105,119],"content":"Using Metadata","linkify":"Using Metadata","nodes":[{"content":"Using Metadata","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"Service metadata contains a machine-readable description of the service.","pos":[120,192]},{"content":"Service metadata includes descriptions of the service endpoints, bindings, contracts, operations, and messages.","pos":[193,304]},{"content":"You can use service metadata for a variety of purposes, including automatically generating a client for consuming the service, implementing the service description, and dynamically updating the binding for a client.","pos":[305,520]},{"pos":[529,544],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Understanding Generated Client Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-generated-client-code.md)</ept>","pos":[548,672],"source":"[Understanding Generated Client Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-generated-client-code.md)"},{"content":"Describes the different classes and interfaces the Svcutil.exe tool generates.","pos":[676,754]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)</ept>","pos":[761,932],"source":"[How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)"},{"content":"Demonstrates how to retrieve metadata using Svcutil.exe and implement a compliant service.","pos":[936,1026]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Generating a WCF Client from Service Metadata<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/generating-a-wcf-client-from-service-metadata.md)</ept>","pos":[1033,1177],"source":"[Generating a WCF Client from Service Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/generating-a-wcf-client-from-service-metadata.md)"},{"content":"Demonstrates how to retrieve metadata using Svcutil.exe and generate a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) client.","pos":[1181,1298]},{"pos":[1307,1315],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1319,1389],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Metadata<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/metadata.md)</ept>","source":"[Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/metadata.md)"}]}
