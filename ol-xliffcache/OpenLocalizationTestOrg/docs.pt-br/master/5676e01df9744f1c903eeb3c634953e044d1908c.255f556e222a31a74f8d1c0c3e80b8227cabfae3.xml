In each of these cases, you are not allowed to write to the read-only local variable, or to take its address. This error is generated when the compiler realizes you are trying to take the address of a read-only local variable.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example generates CS0459 when an attempt is made to take the address of a read-only local variable in a `foreach` loop and in a `fixed` statement block.  \n  \n```  \n// CS0459.cs  \n// compile with: /unsafe  \n  \nclass A  \n{  \n    public unsafe void M1()  \n    {  \n        int[] ints = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };  \n        foreach (int i in ints)  \n        {  \n            int *j = &i;  // CS0459  \n        }  \n  \n        fixed (int *i = &_i)  \n        {  \n            int **j = &i;  // CS0459  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    private int _i = 0;  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0459 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0459 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS0459","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0459","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0459","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Cannot take the address of a read-only local variable","pos":[587,640]},{"content":"There are three common scenarios in the C# language that generate read-only local variables: <ph id=\"ph1\">`foreach`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`using`</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">`fixed`</ph>.","pos":[647,772],"source":"There are three common scenarios in the C# language that generate read-only local variables: `foreach`, `using`, and `fixed`."},{"content":"In each of these cases, you are not allowed to write to the read-only local variable, or to take its address.","pos":[773,882]},{"content":"This error is generated when the compiler realizes you are trying to take the address of a read-only local variable.","pos":[883,999]},{"pos":[1008,1015],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1019,1185],"content":"The following example generates CS0459 when an attempt is made to take the address of a read-only local variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`foreach`</ph> loop and in a <ph id=\"ph2\">`fixed`</ph> statement block.","source":"The following example generates CS0459 when an attempt is made to take the address of a read-only local variable in a `foreach` loop and in a `fixed` statement block."}]}
