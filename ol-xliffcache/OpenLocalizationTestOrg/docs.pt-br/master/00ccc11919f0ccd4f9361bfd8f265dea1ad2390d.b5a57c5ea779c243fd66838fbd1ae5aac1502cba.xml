This can be required by a middle-tier application that connects to a back-end server on behalf of a user and uses an authentication protocol that supports delegation, such as Kerberos, or by a middle-tier application that supplies its own credentials, as in the example below. For example, suppose a user, Joe, visits an internal Web site that displays his payroll information. After authenticating Joe, the middle-tier application server uses Joe's credentials to connect to the back-end server to retrieve his payroll information. Next, Susan visits the site and requests her payroll information. Because the middle-tier application has already made a connection using Joe's credentials, the back-end server responds with Joe's information. However, if the application assigns each request sent to the back-end server to a connection group formed from the user name, then each user belongs to a separate connection pool and cannot accidentally share authentication information with another user.  \n  \n To assign a request to a specific connection group, you must assign a name to the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.ConnectionGroupName%2A> property of your <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> before making the request.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Managing Connections](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/managing-connections.md)\n- [How to: Assign User Information to Group Connections](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-assign-user-information-to-group-connections.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,304],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Connection Grouping\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Internet, connections\"\n  - \"connections [.NET Framework], grouping\"\n  - \"WebRequest class, connection grouping\"\n  - \"network resources, connections\"\n  - \"connection pooling\"\nms.assetid: 2ec502e8-4ba0-4c22-9410-f28eaf4eee63","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Grouping","nodes":[{"pos":[0,19],"content":"Connection Grouping","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Grouping","pos":[0,19]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[311,330],"content":"Connection Grouping","linkify":"Connection Grouping","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Grouping","pos":[0,19]}]},{"content":"Connection grouping associates specific requests within a single application to a defined connection pool.","pos":[331,437]},{"content":"This can be required by a middle-tier application that connects to a back-end server on behalf of a user and uses an authentication protocol that supports delegation, such as Kerberos, or by a middle-tier application that supplies its own credentials, as in the example below.","pos":[438,714]},{"content":"For example, suppose a user, Joe, visits an internal Web site that displays his payroll information.","pos":[715,815]},{"content":"After authenticating Joe, the middle-tier application server uses Joe's credentials to connect to the back-end server to retrieve his payroll information.","pos":[816,970]},{"content":"Next, Susan visits the site and requests her payroll information.","pos":[971,1036]},{"content":"Because the middle-tier application has already made a connection using Joe's credentials, the back-end server responds with Joe's information.","pos":[1037,1180]},{"content":"However, if the application assigns each request sent to the back-end server to a connection group formed from the user name, then each user belongs to a separate connection pool and cannot accidentally share authentication information with another user.","pos":[1181,1435]},{"pos":[1442,1648],"content":"To assign a request to a specific connection group, you must assign a name to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest.ConnectionGroupName%2A&gt;</ph> property of your <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest&gt;</ph> before making the request.","source":"To assign a request to a specific connection group, you must assign a name to the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.ConnectionGroupName%2A> property of your <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> before making the request."},{"pos":[1657,1665],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1669,1760],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Managing Connections<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/managing-connections.md)</ept>","source":"[Managing Connections](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/managing-connections.md)"},{"pos":[1763,1917],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Assign User Information to Group Connections<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-assign-user-information-to-group-connections.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Assign User Information to Group Connections](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/how-to-assign-user-information-to-group-connections.md)"}]}
