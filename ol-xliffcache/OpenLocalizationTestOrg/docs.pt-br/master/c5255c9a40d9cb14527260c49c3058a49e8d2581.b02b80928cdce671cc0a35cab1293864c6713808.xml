To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `WpfHost`.  \n  \n## Creating the WPF Control  \n After you add a WPF control to the project, you can arrange it on the form.  \n  \n#### To create WPF controls  \n  \n1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to the project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Blue`.  \n  \n3.  Build the project.  \n  \n## Changing Property Values on the WPF Control  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> smart tag makes it easy to change properties of hosted WPF content by using the WPF Designer.  \n  \n#### To host a WPF control  \n  \n1.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, in the **WPF User Controls** tab, double-click `UserControl1` to create an instance of `UserControl1` on the form.  \n  \n     The instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  \n  \n3.  In the **ElementHost Tasks** smart tag panel, select **Edit Hosted Content**.  \n  \n     UserControl1.xaml opens in the WPF Designer.  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Red`.  \n  \n5.  Rebuild the project.  \n  \n6.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n     The instance of `UserControl1` has a red background.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>   \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)   \n [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms-at-design-time.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)   \n [Migration and Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)   \n [Using WPF Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-wpf-controls.md)   \n [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,667],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WPF content [Windows Forms], changing properties at design time\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, changing properties of WPF content at design time\"\n  - \"WPF content, hosting in Windows Forms\"\n  - \"interoperability [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: a1f7a90c-0bbb-4781-8c3c-8cc8bef2488d\ncaps.latest.revision: 10\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,88],"content":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,88]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[674,745],"content":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time","linkify":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time","pos":[0,71]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough shows you how to change property values of a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control hosted on a Windows Form.","pos":[746,879]},{"content":"In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:","pos":[886,939]},{"content":"Create the project.","pos":[949,968]},{"content":"Create the WPF control.","pos":[978,1001]},{"content":"Host the WPF controls on a Windows Form.","pos":[1011,1051]},{"content":"Use the WPF Designer for Visual Studio to change property values.","pos":[1061,1126]},{"pos":[1134,1510],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
