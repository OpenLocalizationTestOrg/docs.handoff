The server must be authenticated with a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate, and the clients must trust the server's certificate. The client is not authenticated by any mechanism and is, therefore, anonymous.\n\nFor a sample application, see [WS Transport Security](../samples/ws-transport-security.md). For more information about transport security, see [Transport Security Overview](transport-security-overview.md).\n\nFor more information about using a certificate with a service, see [Working with Certificates](working-with-certificates.md) and [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md).\n\n![Using transport security with an anonymous client](./media/8fa2e931-0cfb-4aaa-9272-91d652b85d8d.gif)\n\n|Characteristic|Description|\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n|Security Mode|Transport|\n|Interoperability|With existing Web services and clients|\n|Authentication (Server)<br /><br /> Authentication (Client)|Yes<br /><br /> Application level (no WCF support)|\n|Integrity|Yes|\n|Confidentiality|Yes|\n|Transport|HTTPS|\n|Binding|<xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding>|\n\n## Service\n\nThe following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:\n\n- Create a stand-alone service using the code with no configuration.\n\n- Create a service using the supplied configuration, but do not define any endpoints.\n\n### Code\n\nThe following code shows how to create an endpoint using transport security:\n\n[!code-csharp[c_SecurityScenarios#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#5)]\n[!code-vb[c_SecurityScenarios#5](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#5)]\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe following code sets up the same endpoint using configuration. The client is not authenticated by any mechanism, and is therefore anonymous.\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n  <system.serviceModel>\n    <services>\n      <service name=\"ServiceModel.Calculator\">\n        <endpoint address=\"https://localhost/Calculator\"\n                  binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"\n                  bindingConfiguration=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\"\n                  name=\"SecuredByTransportEndpoint\"\n                  contract=\"ServiceModel.ICalculator\" />\n      </service>\n    </services>\n    <bindings>\n      <wsHttpBinding>\n        <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\">\n          <security mode=\"Transport\">\n            <transport clientCredentialType=\"None\" />\n          </security>\n        </binding>\n      </wsHttpBinding>\n    </bindings>\n    <client />\n  </system.serviceModel>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n## Client\n\nThe following code and configuration are meant to run independently. Do one of the following:\n\n- Create a stand-alone client using the code (and client code).\n\n- Create a client that does not define any endpoint addresses. Instead, use the client constructor that takes the configuration name as an argument. For example:\n\n     [!code-csharp[C_SecurityScenarios#0](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#0)]\n     [!code-vb[C_SecurityScenarios#0](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#0)]\n\n### Code\n\n[!code-csharp[c_SecurityScenarios#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/cs/source.cs#6)]\n[!code-vb[c_SecurityScenarios#6](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_securityscenarios/vb/source.vb#6)]\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe following configuration can be used instead of the code to set up the service.\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n  <system.serviceModel>\n    <bindings>\n      <wsHttpBinding>\n        <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\" >\n          <security mode=\"Transport\">\n            <transport clientCredentialType=\"None\" />\n          </security>\n        </binding>\n      </wsHttpBinding>\n    </bindings>\n    <client>\n      <endpoint address=\"https://machineName/Calculator\"\n                binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"\n                bindingConfiguration=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\"\n                contract=\"ICalculator\"\n                name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\" />\n    </client>\n  </system.serviceModel>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Security Overview](security-overview.md)\n- [WS Transport Security](../samples/ws-transport-security.md)\n- [Transport Security
