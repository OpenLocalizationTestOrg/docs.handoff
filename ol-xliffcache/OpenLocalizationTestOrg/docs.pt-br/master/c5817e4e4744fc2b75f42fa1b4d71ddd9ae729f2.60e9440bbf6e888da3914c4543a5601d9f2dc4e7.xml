To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `ArrangeElementHost`.  \n  \n## Creating the WPF Control  \n After you add a WPF control to the project, you can arrange it on the form.  \n  \n#### To create WPF controls  \n  \n1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to the project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n2.  In Design view, make sure that `UserControl1` is selected. For more information, see [How to: Select and Move Elements on the Design Surface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/54cb70b6-b35b-46e4-a0cc-65189399c474).  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to `200`.  \n  \n4.  Set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Blue`.  \n  \n5.  Build the project.  \n  \n## Hosting WPF Controls in a Layout Panel  \n You can use WPF controls in layout panels in the same way you use other Windows Forms controls.  \n  \n#### To host WPF controls in a layout panel  \n  \n1.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control onto the form.  \n  \n3.  On the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control's smart tag panel, select **Remove Last Row**.  \n  \n4.  Resize the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to a larger width and height.  \n  \n5.  In the **Toolbox**, double-click `UserControl1` to create an instance of `UserControl1` in the first cell of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n     The instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  \n  \n6.  In the **Toolbox**, double-click `UserControl1` to create another instance in the second cell of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n7.  In the **Document Outline** window, select `tableLayoutPanel1`. For more information, see [Document Outline Window](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9054f2bc-f6f8-4242-9fe0-be71089b12f8).  \n  \n8.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Padding%2A> property to `10, 10, 10, 10`.  \n  \n     Both <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls are resized to fit into the new layout.  \n  \n## Using Snaplines to Align WPF Controls  \n Snaplines enable easy alignment of controls on a form. You can use snaplines to align your WPF controls as well. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md).  \n  \n#### To use snaplines to align WPF controls  \n  \n1.  From the **Toolbox**, drag an instance of `UserControl1` onto the form and place it in the space beneath the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n     The instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost3`.  \n  \n2.  Using snaplines, align the left edge of `elementHost3` with the left edge of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n3.  Using snaplines, size `elementHost3` to the same width as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n4.  Move `elementHost3` toward the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control until a center snapline appears between the controls.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the Margin property to `20, 20, 20, 20`.  \n  \n6.  Move the `elementHost3` away from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control until the center snapline appears again. The center snapline now indicates a margin of 20.  \n  \n7.  Move `elementHost3` to the right, until its left edge aligns with the left edge of `elementHost1`.  \n  \n8.  Change the width of `elementHost3` until its right edge aligns with the right edge of `elementHost2`.  \n  \n## Anchoring and Docking WPF Controls  \n A WPF control hosted on a form has the same anchoring and docking behavior as other Windows Forms controls.  \n  \n#### To anchor and dock WPF controls  \n  \n1.  Select `elementHost1`.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property to **Top, Bottom, Left, Right**.  \n  \n3.  Resize the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to a larger size.  \n  \n     The `elementHost1` control resizes to fill the cell.  \n  \n4.  Select `elementHost2`.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>.  \n  \n     The `elementHost2` control resizes to fill the cell.  \n  \n6.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n7.  Set the value of its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>.  \n  \n8.  Select `elementHost3`.  \n  \n9. Set the value of its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>.  \n  \n     The `elementHost3` control resizes to fill the remaining space on the form.  \n  \n10. Resize the form.  \n  \n     All three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls resize appropriately.  \n  \n     For more information, see [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-tablelayoutpanel-control.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>   \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)   \n [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms-at-design-time.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Arranging Controls on Windows Forms Using Snaplines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/walkthrough-arranging-controls-on-windows-forms-using-snaplines.md)   \n [Migration and Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)   \n [Using WPF Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-wpf-controls.md)   \n [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,95],"content":"Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,83]}]},{"pos":[766,832],"content":"Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","linkify":"Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","pos":[0,66]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough shows you how to use the Windows Forms layout features, such as anchoring and snaplines, to arrange Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) controls.","pos":[833,997]},{"content":"In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:","pos":[1004,1057]},{"content":"Create the project.","pos":[1067,1086]},{"content":"Create the WPF control.","pos":[1096,1119]},{"content":"Host WPF controls in a layout panel.","pos":[1129,1165]},{"content":"Use snaplines to align WPF controls.","pos":[1175,1211]},{"content":"Anchor and dock WPF controls.","pos":[1221,1250]},{"pos":[1258,1634],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
