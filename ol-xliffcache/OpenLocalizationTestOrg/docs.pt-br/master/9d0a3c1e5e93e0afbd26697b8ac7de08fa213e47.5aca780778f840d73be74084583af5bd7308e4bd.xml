It is the same dialog box that you see in other Windows-based applications to select colors. Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ColorDialog Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/colordialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select colors from a palette.  \n  \n [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-colordialog-component.md)  \n Describes how to change the colors available to users and other properties.  \n  \n [How to: Show a Color Palette with the ColorDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-show-a-color-palette-with-the-colordialog-component.md)  \n Explains how to select a color at run time by means of an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> component.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls You Can Use On Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog>  \n Provides reference information on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ColorDialog> class and its members.  \n  \n [Essential Code for Windows Forms Dialog Boxes](assetId:///VS|dv_vstechart|~\\html\\vbtchessentialcodeforwindowsformsdialogboxes.htm)  \n Discusses the Windows Forms dialog box controls and components and the code necessary for executing their basic functions.  \n  \n [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)  \n Lists a set of controls that
