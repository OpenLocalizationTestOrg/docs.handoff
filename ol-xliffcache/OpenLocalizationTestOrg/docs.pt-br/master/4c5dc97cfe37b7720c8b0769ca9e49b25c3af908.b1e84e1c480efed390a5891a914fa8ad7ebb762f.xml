Correlation provides the mechanism for this. The topics in this section provide an overview of correlation and how to use it in different workflow service scenarios.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Correlation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md)  \n Provides an overview of the types of correlation available in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n [Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/durable-duplex-correlation.md)  \n Describes durable duplex correlation.\n  \n [Request-Reply](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md)  \n Describes request-reply correlation.  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/troubleshooting-correlation.md)  \n Provides methods for troubleshooting correlation.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.CorrelationQuery>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,95],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Correlation\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 60151f6c-19b7-47af-9cdc-76c2ac95f301","nodes":[{"content":"Correlation","nodes":[{"pos":[0,11],"content":"Correlation","nodes":[{"content":"Correlation","pos":[0,11]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[102,113],"content":"Correlation","linkify":"Correlation","nodes":[{"content":"Correlation","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"When workflow service applications communicate with other services, it is important that messages between them are dispatched to the appropriate workflow instance.","pos":[114,277]},{"content":"Correlation provides the mechanism for this.","pos":[278,322]},{"content":"The topics in this section provide an overview of correlation and how to use it in different workflow service scenarios.","pos":[323,443]},{"pos":[452,467],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Correlation Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[471,565],"source":"[Correlation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md)"},{"content":"Provides an overview of the types of correlation available in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[569,709],"source":"Provides an overview of the types of correlation available in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)]."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Durable Duplex<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/durable-duplex-correlation.md)</ept>","pos":[716,810],"source":"[Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/durable-duplex-correlation.md)"},{"content":"Describes durable duplex correlation.","pos":[814,851]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Request-Reply<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md)</ept>","pos":[856,948],"source":"[Request-Reply](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md)"},{"content":"Describes request-reply correlation.","pos":[952,988]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Troubleshooting Correlation<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/troubleshooting-correlation.md)</ept>","pos":[995,1103],"source":"[Troubleshooting Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/troubleshooting-correlation.md)"},{"content":"Provides methods for troubleshooting correlation.","pos":[1107,1156]},{"pos":[1165,1173],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
