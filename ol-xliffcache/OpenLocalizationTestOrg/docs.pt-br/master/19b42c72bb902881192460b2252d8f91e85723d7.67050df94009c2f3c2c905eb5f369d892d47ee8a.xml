These classes, derived from <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse>, are returned by default whenever the static method <xref:System.Net.WebRequest.Create%2A?displayProperty=fullName> encounters a URI beginning with \"http\" or \"https\". In most cases, the **WebRequest** and **WebResponse** classes provide all that is necessary to make the request, but if you need access to the HTTP-specific features exposed as properties, you can typecast these classes to **HttpWebRequest** or **HttpWebResponse**.  \n  \n **HttpWebRequest** and **HttpWebResponse** encapsulate a standard HTTP request-and-response transaction and provide access to common HTTP headers. These classes also support most HTTP 1.1 features, including pipelining, sending and receiving data in chunks, authentication, preauthentication, encryption, proxy support, server certificate validation, and connection management. Custom headers and headers not provided through properties can be stored in and accessed through the **Headers** property.  \n  \n **HttpWebRequest** is the default class used by **WebRequest** and does not need to be registered before you can pass a URI to the **WebRequest.Create** method.  \n  \n You can make your application follow HTTP redirects automatically by setting the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebRequest.AllowAutoRedirect%2A> property to **true** (the default). The application will redirect requests, and the <xref:System.Net.HttpWebResponse.ResponseUri%2A> property of **HttpWebResponse** will contain the actual Web resource that responded to the request. If you set **AllowAutoRedirect** to **false**, your application must be able to handle redirects as HTTP protocol errors.  \n  \n Applications receive HTTP protocol errors by catching a <xref:System.Net.WebException> with the <xref:System.Net.WebException.Status%2A> set to <xref:System.Net.WebExceptionStatus>. The <xref:System.Net.WebException.Response%2A> property contains the **WebResponse** sent by the server and indicates the actual HTTP error encountered.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Accessing the Internet
