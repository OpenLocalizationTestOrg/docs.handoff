Services running in [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode participate fully in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application pipeline and can make use of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features such as file/URL authorization, session state, and the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class. The <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class allows access to cookies, sessions, and other [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features. This mode requires that the bindings use the HTTP transport and the service itself must be hosted in IIS.  \n  \n In this sample, the client is a console application (an executable) and the service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This sample requires a [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] application pool in order to run. To create a new application pool, or to modify the default application pool, follow these steps.  \n>   \n>  1.  Open **Control Panel**.  Open the **Administrative Tools** applet under the **System and Security** heading. Open the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** applet.  \n> 2.  Expand the treeview in the **Connections** pane. Select the **Application Pools** node.  \n> 3.  To set the default application pool to use [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] (which may cause incompatibility problems with existing sites), right-click the **DefaultAppPool** list item and select **Basic Settings…**. Set the **.Net Framework Version** pull-down to **.Net Framework v4.0.30128** (or later).  \n> 4.  To create a new application pool that uses [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] (to preserve compatibility for other applications), right-click the **Application Pools** node and select **Add Application Pool…**. Name the new application pool, and set the **.Net Framework Version** pull-down to **.Net Framework v4.0.30128** (or later). After running the setup steps below, right-click the **ServiceModelSamples** application and select **Manage Application**, **Advanced Settings…**. Set the **Application Pool** to the new application pool.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Services\\Hosting\\WebHost\\ASPNetCompatibility`  \n  \n This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), which implements a calculator service. The `ICalculator` contract has been modified as the `ICalculatorSession` contract to allow a set of operations to be performed, while keeping a running result.  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic interface ICalculatorSession  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    void Clear();  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    void AddTo(double n);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    void SubtractFrom(double n);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    void MultiplyBy(double n);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    void DivideBy(double n);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Result();  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The service maintains state, using the feature, for each client as multiple service operations are called to perform a calculation. The client can retrieve the current result by calling `Result` and can clear the result to zero by calling `Clear`.  \n  \n The service uses the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session to store the result for each client session. This allows the service to maintain the running result for each client across multiple calls to the service.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session state and [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] sessions are very different things.  See the [Session](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/session.md) for details on [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] sessions.  \n  \n The service has an intimate dependency on [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] session state and requires [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] compatibility mode to function correctly. These requirements are expressed declaratively by applying the `AspNetCompatibilityRequirements` attribute.  \n  \n```  \n[AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode =  \n                       AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required)]  \npublic class CalculatorService : ICalculatorSession  \n{  \n    double Result  \n    {  // store result in AspNet Session  \n       get {  \n          if (HttpContext.Current.Session[\"Result\"] != null)  \n             return (double)HttpContext.Current.Session[\"Result\"];  \n          return 0.0D;  \n       }  \n       set  \n       {  \n          HttpContext.Current.Session[\"Result\"] = value;  \n       }  \n    }  \n    public void Clear()  \n    {  \n        Result = 0.0D;  \n    }  \n    public void AddTo(double n)  \n    {  \n        Result += n;  \n    }  \n    public void SubtractFrom(double n)  \n    {  \n        Result -= n;  \n    }  \n    public void MultiplyBy(double n)  \n    {  \n        Result *= n;  \n    }  \n    public void DivideBy(double n)  \n    {  \n        Result /= n;  \n    }  \n    public double Result()  \n    {  \n        return Result;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \n  \n0, + 100, - 50, * 17.65, / 2 = 441.25  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Be sure you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  After the solution has been built, run Setup.bat to set up the ServiceModelSamples Application in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]. The ServiceModelSamples directory should now appear as an [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] Application.  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [AppFabric Hosting and Persistence Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=193961)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,342],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ASP.NET Compatibility | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: c8b51f1e-c096-4c42-ad99-0519887bbbc5\ncaps.latest.revision: 25\nauthor: \"Erikre\"\nms.author: \"erikre\"\nmanager: \"erikre\"","nodes":[{"content":"ASP.NET Compatibility | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"ASP.NET Compatibility | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"ASP.NET Compatibility | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[349,370],"content":"ASP.NET Compatibility","linkify":"ASP.NET Compatibility","nodes":[{"content":"ASP.NET Compatibility","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates how to enable <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]</ph> Compatibility mode in <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[371,546],"source":"This sample demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]."},{"content":"Services running in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]</ph> Compatibility mode participate fully in the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]</ph> application pipeline and can make use of <ph id=\"ph3\">[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]</ph> features such as file/URL authorization, session state, and the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Web.HttpContext&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[547,926],"source":" Services running in [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode participate fully in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application pipeline and can make use of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features such as file/URL authorization, session state, and the <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.HttpContext&gt;</ph> class allows access to cookies, sessions, and other <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)]</ph> features.","pos":[927,1080],"source":" The <xref:System.Web.HttpContext> class allows access to cookies, sessions, and other [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] features."},{"content":"This mode requires that the bindings use the HTTP transport and the service itself must be hosted in IIS.","pos":[1081,1186]},{"content":"In this sample, the client is a console application (an executable) and the service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS).","pos":[1193,1326]},{"pos":[1334,1442],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The set-up procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.","pos":[9,106]}]},{"pos":[1450,1680],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This sample requires a [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] application pool in order to run.
