help secure messages.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] Windows Server AppFabric and security, see [Security Model for Windows Server AppFabric](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-overview.md)  \n Describes the security features in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [Security Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-concepts.md)  \n

behaviors that affect security, such as setting credentials.  \n  \n [Bindings and Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/bindings-and-security.md)  \n A security-oriented view of the bindings, including topics that demonstrate how to create custom security bindings.  \n  \n [Securing Services and Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-services-and-clients.md)  \n Describes how to secure messages using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security features.  \n  \n [Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authentication-in-wcf.md)  \n Demonstrates common authentication tasks.  \n  \n [Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authorization-in-wcf.md)  \n Describes common authorization scenarios with security implementations.  \n  \n [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)  \n Describes the basics of federation and how to create clients that communicate with federated servers.  \n  \n [Partial Trust](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust.md)  \n Describes how to run partially-trusted scenarios and [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] limitations when running partially trusted.  \n  \n [Auditing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/auditing-security-events.md)  \n Describes how to audit security events.  \n  \n [Security Guidance and Best Practices](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-guidance-and-best-practices.md)  \n Guidelines for creating secure [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security>  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [WCF
