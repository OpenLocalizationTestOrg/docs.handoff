The term \"cloud\" is synonymous with \"peer mesh\" and \"peer-to-peer graph\".  \n  \n Communication between nodes should never cross from one cloud to another. A <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> instance is uniquely identified by its name, which is case-sensitive. A single peer or node may be connected to more than one cloud.  \n  \n Clouds are tied very closely to network interfaces.  On a multi-homed machine with two network cards attached to different subnets, three clouds will be returned: one for each of the link local addresses per interface, and a single global scope cloud.  \n  \n PNRP uses three cloud \"scopes\", in which a scope is a grouping of computers that are able to find each other:  \n  \n-   The global cloud corresponds to the global IPv6 address scope and global addresses and represents all the computers on the entire IPv6 Internet. There is only a single global cloud.  \n  \n-   The link-local cloud corresponds to the link-local IPv6 address scope and link-local addresses. A link-local cloud is for a specific link, which is typically the same as the locally attached subnet. There can be multiple link-local clouds.  \n  \n A third cloud, the site-specific cloud, corresponds to the site IPv6 address scope and site-local addresses. This cloud has been deprecated, although it is still supported in PNRP.  \n  \n## Clouds  \n PNRP clouds are represented by instances of the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> class. Groups of clouds used a peer are represented by instances of the enumerable <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.CloudCollection> class. Collections of PNRP clouds known to the current peer can be obtained by calling the static <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud.GetAvailableClouds%2A> method.  \n  \n Individual clouds have unique names, represented as a 256 character Unicode string. These names, along with the above-mentioned scope, are used to construct unique instances of the Cloud class. These instances can be serialized and reconstructed for persistent usage.  \n  \n Once a Cloud instance is created or obtained, peer names can be registered with it to create a mesh of known peers.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud>   \n [Peer Name Resolution Protocol](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/peer-name-resolution-protocol.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,356],"nodes":[{"content":"PNRP Clouds | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,28],"content":"PNRP Clouds | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"PNRP Clouds | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,28]}]}],"pos":[6,37],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"PNRP Clouds | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
