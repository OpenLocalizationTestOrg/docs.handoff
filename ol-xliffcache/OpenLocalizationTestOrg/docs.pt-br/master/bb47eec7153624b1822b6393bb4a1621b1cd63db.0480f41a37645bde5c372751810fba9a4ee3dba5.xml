The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes include type support features including the ability to convert between XML Schema types and common language runtime (CLR) types.  \n  \n In the .NET Framework version 2.0, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes have been enhanced to include type support features.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> classes each include a **SchemaInfo** property that returns the schema information on a node.  \n  \n-   The **ReadContentAs** and **ReadElementContentAs** and methods on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> class read a text value and convert it to a CLR value in a single method call.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter.WriteValue%2A> method on the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> class converts a CLR type to an XML Schema type when writing out XML.  \n  \n-   The **ValueAs** and <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator.TypedValue%2A> properties on the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> class return a node value and convert it to a CLR value in a single method call.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the .NET Framework version 1.0 the <xref:System.Xml.XmlConvert> class was needed to convert between XML Schema and CLR types.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Mapping XML Data Types to CLR Types](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/mapping-xml-data-types-to-clr-types.md)  \n Describes the default mappings of XML data types to CLR types.  \n  \n [XML Type Support Implementation Notes](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-type-support-implementation-notes.md)  \n Discusses some of the type support implementation details.  \n  \n [Conversion of XML Data Types](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/conversion-of-xml-data-types.md)  \n Describes how to use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlConvert> class to convert between XML Schema and CLR types.  \n  \n##
