Any numeric expression.  \n  \n `expression2`  \n Required. Any numeric expression.  \n  \n## Supported Types  \n All numeric types, including the unsigned and floating-point types and `Decimal`.  \n  \n## Result  \n The result is the integer quotient of `expression1` divided by `expression2`, which discards any remainder and retains only the integer portion. This is known as *truncation*.  \n  \n The result data type is a numeric type appropriate for the data types of `expression1` and `expression2`. See the \"Integer Arithmetic\" tables in [Data Types of Operator Results](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/data-types-of-operator-results.md).  \n  \n The [/ Operator (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/floating-point-division-operator.md) returns the full quotient, which retains the remainder in the fractional portion.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Before performing the division, Visual Basic attempts to convert any floating-point numeric expression to `Long`. If `Option Strict` is `On`, a compiler error occurs. If `Option Strict` is `Off`, an <xref:System.OverflowException> is possible if the value is outside the range of the [Long Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/long-data-type.md). The conversion to `Long` is also subject to *banker's rounding*. For more information, see \"Fractional Parts\" in [Type Conversion Functions](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions.md).  \n  \n If `expression1` or `expression2` evaluates to [Nothing](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md), it is treated as zero.  \n  \n## Attempted Division by Zero  \n If `expression2` evaluates to zero, the `\\` operator throws a <xref:System.DivideByZeroException> exception. This is true for all numeric data types of the operands.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `\\` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when an operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the `\\` operator to perform integer division. The result is an integer that represents the integer quotient of the two operands, with the remainder discarded.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#18](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/VisualBasic/integer-division-operator_1.vb)]  \n  \n The expressions in the preceding example return values of 2, 3, 33, and -22, respectively.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [\\\\= Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/integer-division-assignment-operator.md)   \n [/ Operator (Visual
