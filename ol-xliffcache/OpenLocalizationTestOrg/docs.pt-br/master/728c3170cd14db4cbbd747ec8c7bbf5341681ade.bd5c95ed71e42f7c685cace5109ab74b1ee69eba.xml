It is called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#14](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/static-constructors_1.cs)]  \n  \n Static constructors have the following properties:  \n  \n-   A static constructor does not take access modifiers or have parameters.  \n  \n-   A static constructor is called automatically to initialize the [class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced.  \n  \n-   A static constructor cannot be called directly.  \n  \n-   The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.  \n  \n-   A typical use of static constructors is when the class is using a log file and the constructor is used to write entries to this file.  \n  \n-   Static constructors are also useful when creating wrapper classes for unmanaged code, when the constructor can call the `LoadLibrary` method.  \n  \n-   If a static constructor throws an exception, the runtime will not invoke it a second time, and the type will remain uninitialized for the lifetime of the application domain in which your program is running.  \n  \n## Example  \n In this example, class `Bus` has a static constructor. When the first instance of `Bus` is created (`bus1`), the static constructor is invoked to initialize the class. The sample output verifies that the static constructor runs only one time, even though two instances of `Bus` are created, and that it runs before the instance constructor runs.  \n  \n
