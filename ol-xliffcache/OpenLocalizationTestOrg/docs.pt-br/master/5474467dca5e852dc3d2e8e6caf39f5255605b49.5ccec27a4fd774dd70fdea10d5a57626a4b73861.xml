This is usually due to an invalid key file name, an invalid key file path, or a corrupt key file.  \n  \n To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.  \n  \n For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly (Visual Studio)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f468a7d3-234c-4353-924d-8e0ae5896564), [/keyfile (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/keyfile-compiler-option.md) and [/delaysign (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/delaysign-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n When creating an assembly, the C# compiler calls into a utility called al.exe. If there is a failure in the assembly creation, the reason for the failure is reported by al.exe.
