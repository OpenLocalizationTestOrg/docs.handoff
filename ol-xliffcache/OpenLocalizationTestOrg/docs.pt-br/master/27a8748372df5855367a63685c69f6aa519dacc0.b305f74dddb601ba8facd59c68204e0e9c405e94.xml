You can create security binding elements for these authentication modes by using static methods on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class or through configuration, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] the 18 authentication modes, see [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows methods for creating bindings for the various authentication modes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Once an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> object is created, a number of properties are immutable, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.IssuedSecurityTokenParameters.KeyType%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.MessageSecurityVersion%2A>.
