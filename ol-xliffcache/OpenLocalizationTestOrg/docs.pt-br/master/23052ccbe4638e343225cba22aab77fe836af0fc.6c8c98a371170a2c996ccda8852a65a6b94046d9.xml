The callback function allows the host to process the completed I/O request.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** MSCorWks.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Deprecated CLR Hosting Functions](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/deprecated-clr-hosting-functions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,681],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"reference\"\napi_name: \n  - \"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE\"\napi_location: \n  - \"mscoree.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"C++\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE function pointer [.NET Framework hosting]\"\nms.assetid: 5fb645d9-b818-401c-8c2c-c30d86de58ba\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\ncaps.latest.revision: 10\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,65]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[688,736],"content":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer","linkify":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer","nodes":[{"content":"LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE Function Pointer","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"Points to a function that notifies the host when an overlapped (that is, asynchronous) I/O to a device has completed.","pos":[737,854]},{"pos":[861,976],"content":"This function pointer has been deprecated in the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]</ph>.","source":"This function pointer has been deprecated in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]."},{"pos":[985,991],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1181,1191],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A value that is an error code if the device has been closed; otherwise, this value is zero.","pos":[1212,1308]},{"content":"Closing a device causes all pending I/O to the device to be completed immediately.","pos":[1315,1397]},{"content":"[in] The number of bytes transferred by the I/O operation.","pos":[1435,1493]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to a structure that contains information to be used to complete the I/O request.","pos":[1518,1613]},{"pos":[1622,1629],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The function to which <ph id=\"ph1\">`LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE`</ph> points is a callback function and must be implemented by the writer of the hosting application.","pos":[1633,1784],"source":"The function to which `LPOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE` points is a callback function and must be implemented by the writer of the hosting application."},{"content":"The callback function allows the host to process the completed I/O request.","pos":[1785,1860]},{"pos":[1869,1881],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[1885,1989],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[1996,2017],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> MSCorEE.h","source":"**Header:** MSCorEE.h"},{"pos":[2024,2049],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> MSCorWks.dll","source":"**Library:** MSCorWks.dll"},{"pos":[2056,2084],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:**"},{"pos":[2173,2181],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2185,2305],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Deprecated CLR Hosting Functions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/deprecated-clr-hosting-functions.md)</ept>","source":"[Deprecated CLR Hosting Functions](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/deprecated-clr-hosting-functions.md)"}]}
