By default, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis70](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis70-md.md)] is configured with these [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types, but [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] are not.  \n  \n This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] to deploy [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications.  \n  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You can check the *UserAgent* string in the registry to determine whether a system has [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] installed. For details and a script that examines the *UserAgent* string to determine whether [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] is installed on a system, see [Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"content_expiration\"></a>   \n## Adjust the Content Expiration Setting  \n You should adjust the content expiration setting to 1 minute. The following procedure outlines how to do this with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)].  \n  \n1.  Click the **Start** menu, point to **Administrative Tools**, and click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**. You can also launch this application from the command line with \"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\iis.msc\".  \n  \n2.  Expand the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)] tree until you find the **Default Web site** node.  \n  \n3.  Right-click **Default Web site** and select **Properties** from the context menu.  \n  \n4.  Select the **HTTP Headers** tab and click \"Enable Content Expiration\".  \n  \n5.  Set the content to expire after 1 minute.  \n  \n<a name=\"register_mime_types\"></a>   \n## Register MIME Types and File Extensions  \n You must register several [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types and file extensions so that the browser on the client's system can load the correct handler. You need to add the following types:  \n  \n|Extension|MIME Type|  \n|---------------|---------------|  \n|.manifest|application/manifest|  \n|.xaml|application/xaml+xml|  \n|.application|application/x-ms-application|  \n|.xbap|application/x-ms-xbap|  \n|.deploy|application/octet-stream|  \n|.xps|application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You do not need to register [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types or file extensions on client systems.
