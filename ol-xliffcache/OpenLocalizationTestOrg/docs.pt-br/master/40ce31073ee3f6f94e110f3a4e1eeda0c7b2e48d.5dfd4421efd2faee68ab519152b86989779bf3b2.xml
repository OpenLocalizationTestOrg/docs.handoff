The output includes the following assets:\n\n* Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a *dll* extension.\n* *.deps.json* file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.\n* *.runtime.config.json* file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).\n* The application's dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.\n\nThe `dotnet publish` command's output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac, laptop) for execution. It's the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment. Depending on the type of deployment that the project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET Core shared runtime installed on it. For more information, see [.NET Core Application Deployment](../deploying/index.md). For the directory structure of a published application, see [Directory structure](/aspnet/core/hosting/directory-structure).\n\n[!INCLUDE[dotnet restore note + options](~/includes/dotnet-restore-note-options.md)]\n\n## Arguments\n\n`PROJECT`\n\nThe project to publish. It's either the path and filename of a [C#](csproj.md), F#, or Visual Basic project file, or the path to a directory that contains a C#, F#, or Visual Basic project file. If not specified, it defaults to the current directory.\n\n## Options\n\n# [.NET Core 2.1](#tab/netcore21)\n\n`-c|--configuration {Debug|Release}`\n\nDefines the build configuration. The default value is `Debug`.\n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nPublishes the application for the specified [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md). You must specify the target framework in the project file.\n\n`--force`\n\nForces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful. Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the *project.assets.json* file.\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`--manifest <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>`\n\nSpecifies one or several [target manifests](../deploying/runtime-store.md) to use to trim the set of packages published with the app. The manifest file is part of the output of the [`dotnet store` command](dotnet-store.md). To specify multiple manifests, add a `--manifest` option for each manifest. This option is available starting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK.\n\n`--no-build`\n\nDoesn't build the project before publishing. It also implicitly sets the `--no-restore` flag.\n\n`--no-dependencies`\n\nIgnores project-to-project references and only restores the root project.\n\n`--no-restore`\n\nDoesn't execute an implicit restore when running the command.\n\n`-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the path for the output directory. If not specified, it defaults to *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/* for a framework-dependent deployment or *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]/publish/* for a self-contained deployment.\nIf the path is relative, the output directory generated is relative to the project file location, not to the current working directory.\n\n`--self-contained`\n\nPublishes the .NET Core runtime with your application so the runtime doesn't need to be installed on the target machine. If a runtime identifier is specified, its default value is `true`. For more information about the different deployment types, see [.NET Core application deployment](../deploying/index.md).\n\n`-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>`\n\nPublishes the application for a given runtime. This is used when creating a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd). For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md). Default is to publish a [framework-dependent deployment (FDD)](../deploying/index.md#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd).\n\n`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`.\n\n`--version-suffix <VERSION_SUFFIX>`\n\nDefines the version suffix to replace the asterisk (`*`) in the version field of the project file.\n\n# [.NET Core 2.0](#tab/netcore20)\n\n`-c|--configuration {Debug|Release}`\n\nDefines the build configuration. The default value is `Debug`.\n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nPublishes the application for the specified [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md). You must specify the target framework in the project file.\n\n`--force`\n\nForces all dependencies to be resolved even if the last restore was successful. Specifying this flag is the same as deleting the *project.assets.json* file.\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`--manifest <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>`\n\nSpecifies one or several [target manifests](../deploying/runtime-store.md) to use to trim the set of packages published with the app. The manifest file is part of the output of the [`dotnet store` command](dotnet-store.md). To specify multiple manifests, add a `--manifest` option for each manifest. This option is available starting with .NET Core 2.0 SDK.\n\n`--no-dependencies`\n\nIgnores project-to-project references and only restores the root project.\n\n`--no-restore`\n\nDoesn't execute an implicit restore when running the command.\n\n`-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the path for the output directory. If not specified, it defaults to *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/publish/* for a framework-dependent deployment or *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]/publish/* for a self-contained deployment.\nIf the path is relative, the output directory generated is relative to the project file location, not to the current working directory.\n\n`--self-contained`\n\nPublishes the .NET Core runtime with your application so the runtime doesn't need to be installed on the target machine. If a runtime identifier is specified, its default value is `true`. For more information about the different deployment types, see [.NET Core application deployment](../deploying/index.md).\n\n`-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>`\n\nPublishes the application for a given runtime. This is used when creating a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd). For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md). Default is to publish a [framework-dependent deployment (FDD)](../deploying/index.md#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd).\n\n`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`.\n\n`--version-suffix <VERSION_SUFFIX>`\n\nDefines the version suffix to replace the asterisk (`*`) in the version field of the project file.\n\n# [.NET Core 1.x](#tab/netcore1x)\n\n`-c|--configuration {Debug|Release}`\n\nDefines the build configuration. The default value is `Debug`.\n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nPublishes the application for the specified [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md). You must specify the target framework in the project file.\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`--manifest <PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE>`\n\nSpecifies one or several [target manifests](../deploying/runtime-store.md) to use to trim the set of packages published with the app. The manifest file is part of the output of the [`dotnet store` command](dotnet-store.md). To specify multiple manifests, add a `--manifest` option for each manifest.

This is used when creating a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd). For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md).

Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`.\n\n`--version-suffix <VERSION_SUFFIX>`\n\nDefines the version suffix to replace the asterisk (`*`) in the version field of the project file.\n\n---\n\n## Examples\n\nPublish the project in the current directory:\n\n`dotnet publish`\n\nPublish the application using the specified project file:\n\n`dotnet publish ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj`\n\nPublish the project in the current directory using the `netcoreapp1.1` framework:\n\n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1`\n\nPublish the current application using the `netcoreapp1.1` framework and the runtime for `OS X 10.10` (you must list this RID in the project file).\n\n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1 --runtime osx.10.11-x64`\n\nPublish the current application but don't restore project-to-project (P2P) references, just the root project during the restore operation (.NET Core SDK 2.0 and later versions):\n\n`dotnet publish --no-dependencies`\n\n## See also\n\n- [Target frameworks](../../standard/frameworks.md)\n- [Runtime IDentifier (RID)
