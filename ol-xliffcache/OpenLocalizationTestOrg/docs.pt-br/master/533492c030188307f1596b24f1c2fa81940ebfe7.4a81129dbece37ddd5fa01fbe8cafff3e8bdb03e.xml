For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  \n  \n The `My.Settings` object exposes each setting as a property. The property name is the same as the setting name, and the property type is the same as the setting type. The setting's **Scope** determines if the property is read-only; the property for an **Application**-scope setting is read-only, while the property for a **User**-scope setting is read-write. For more information, see [My.Settings Object](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot change or save the values of application-scope settings at run time. Application-scope settings can be changed only when creating the application (through the **Project Designer**) or by editing the application's configuration file. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  \n  \n This example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control to access the user-setting properties of the `My.Settings` object. By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> shows all the properties of the `My.Settings` object. However, the user-setting properties have the <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute> attribute. This example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid.BrowsableAttributes%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> to <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute> to display only the user-setting properties.  \n  \n### To add a user setting property grid  \n  \n1.  Add the **PropertyGrid** control from the **Toolbox** to the design surface for your application, assumed here to be `Form1`.  \n  \n     The default name of the property-grid control is `PropertyGrid1`.  \n  \n2.  Double-click the design surface for `Form1` to open the code for the form-load event handler.  \n  \n3.  Set the `My.Settings` object as the selected object for the property grid.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#11](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-create-property-grids-for-user-settings_1.vb)]  \n  \n4.  Configure the property grid to show only the user settings.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#12](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-create-property-grids-for-user-settings_2.vb)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  To show only the application-scope settings, use the <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute> attribute instead of  <xref:System.Configuration.UserScopedSettingAttribute>.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The application saves the user settings when the application shuts down. To save the settings immediately, call the `My.Settings.Save` method.
