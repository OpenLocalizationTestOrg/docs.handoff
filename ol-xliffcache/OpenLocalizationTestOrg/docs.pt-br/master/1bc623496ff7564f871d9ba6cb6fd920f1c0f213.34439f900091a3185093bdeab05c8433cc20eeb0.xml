Depending on your familiarity with .NET, you may wish to explore different sections of this guide and other sections of the .NET documentation.\n\n## New to .NET\n\nIf you're new to .NET, check out the [Get Started](get-started.md) article.\n\nIf you prefer to have a guided tour through major features of .NET, check out the [Tour of .NET](tour.md).\n\nYou can also read about [.NET Architectural Components](components.md) to get an overview of the various \"pieces\" of .NET and how they fit together.\n\n## New to .NET Core\n\nIf you're new to .NET Core, check out [Get Started with .NET Core](../core/get-started.md).\n\n## New to .NET Standard\n\nIf you're new to .NET Standard, check out [.NET Standard Library](library.md).\n\n## Porting .NET Framework Code to .NET Core\n\nIf you're looking to port an application, service, or some component of a system to .NET Core, check out [Porting to .NET Core from .NET Framework](../core/porting/index.md).\n\n## Porting a NuGet package from .NET Framework to .NET Standard or .NET Core\n\nIf you're looking to port a NuGet package to .NET Standard, check out [Porting to .NET Core from .NET Framework](../core/porting/index.md).  Tooling for .NET Standard and .NET Core are shared, so the content will be relevant for porting to .NET Standard as well as .NET Core.\n\n## Interested in Major .NET Concepts\n\nIf you're interested in some of the major concepts of .NET, check out:\n\n* [.NET Architectural Components](components.md)\n* [.NET Standard Library](library.md)\n* [Native Interoperability](native-interop.md)\n* [Garbage Collection](garbagecollection/index.md)\n* [Base Types in .NET](base-types/index.md)\n* [Collections](collections/index.md)\n* [Dates, times, and time zones](datetime/index.md)\n* [Asynchronous Programming](async.md)\n\nAdditionally, check out each language guide to learn about the three major .NET languages:\n\n* [C# Guide](../csharp/index.md)\n* [F# Guide](../fsharp/index.md)\n* [Visual Basic Guide](../visual-basic/index.md)\n\n## API Reference\n\nCheck out the [.NET API Reference](../../api/index.md) to see the breadth of APIs avaialable.","nodes":[{"pos":[11,30],"content":".NET
