Alternatively, if you are building up the element tree for an application entirely using code and not declaring any elements using [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], you can call specific methods to add event handlers to the constructed element tree.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example adds a new <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> to an existing page that is initially defined in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]. A code-behind file implements an event handler method and then adds that method as a new event handler on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_cshrp](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-cshrp-md.md)] example uses the `+=` operator to assign a handler to an event. This is the same operator that is used to assign a handler in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] event handling model. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualb](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualb-md.md)] does not support this operator as a means of adding event handlers. It instead requires one of two techniques:  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A> method, together with an `AddressOf` operator, to reference the event handler implementation.  \n  \n-   Use the `Handles` keyword as part of the event handler definition. This technique is not shown here; see [Visual Basic and WPF Event Handling](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/visual-basic-and-wpf-event-handling.md).  \n  \n [!code-xml[RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler#XAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler/CSharp/default.xaml#xaml)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler#Handler](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler/CSharp/default.xaml.cs#handler)]\n [!code-vb[RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler#Handler](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventAddRemoveHandler/VisualBasic/default.xaml.vb#handler)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Adding an event handler in the initially parsed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page is much simpler.
