Options](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-hosting-options.md)  \n Describes how to select the appropriate host for your workflows.  \n  \n [Using WorkflowInvoker and WorkflowApplication](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-workflowinvoker-and-workflowapplication.md)  \n Describes how to use <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> and <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> to invoke workflows.  \n  \n [Activity Tree Inspection](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/activity-tree-inspection.md)  \n Describes how workflow host authors can inspect a workflow using <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInspectionServices>.  \n  \n [Serializing Workflows and Activities to and from XAML](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/serializing-workflows-and-activities-to-and-from-xaml.md)  \n Describes how to serialize workflows to XAML and work with serialized workflow definitions.  \n  \n [Using WorkflowIdentity and Versioning](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-workflowidentity-and-versioning.md)  \n Describes how to use `WorkflowIdentity` to host multiple versions of a workflow side-by-side.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Workflow Foundation Programming](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/programming.md)   \n [Designing Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/designing-workflows.md)   \n [Windows Workflow Foundation Data
