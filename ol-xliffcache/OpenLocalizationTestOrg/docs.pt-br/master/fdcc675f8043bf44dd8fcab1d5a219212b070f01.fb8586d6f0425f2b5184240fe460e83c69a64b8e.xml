The first part of the sample shows how units of compensable work can be defined in [!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] using a `CompensableActivity` activity and how they are executed in a successful run.  The second part of the sample shows how the same units of compensable work automatically take care of compensation when an unexpected event is hit and the workflow instance is canceled.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Using Visual Studio 2010, open the CompensableActivity.sln.  \n  \n2.  Build the solution by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  Run the application by pressing F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
