For more information on assemblies and metadata, see the topic [Assembly Manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1w45z383).  \n  \n### How to manually determine if a file is an assembly  \n  \n1.  Start the [Ildasm.exe (IL Disassembler)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f7dy01k1).  \n  \n2.  Load the file you wish to test.  \n  \n3.  If **ILDASM** reports that the file is not a portable executable (PE) file, then it is not an assembly. For more information, see the topic [How to: View Assembly Contents](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-view-assembly-contents.md).  \n  \n### How to programmatically determine if a file is an assembly  \n  \n1.  Call the <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName%2A> method, passing the full file path and name of the file you are testing.  \n  \n2.  If a <xref:System.BadImageFormatException> exception is thrown, the file is not an assembly.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example tests a DLL to see if it is an assembly.  \n  \n```  \nclass TestAssembly  \n{  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n  \n        try  \n        {  \n            System.Reflection.AssemblyName testAssembly =  \n                System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName(@\"C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v3.5\\System.Net.dll\");  \n  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Yes, the file is an assembly.\");  \n        }  \n  \n        catch (System.IO.FileNotFoundException)  \n        {  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"The file cannot be found.\");  \n        }  \n  \n        catch (System.BadImageFormatException)  \n        {  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"The file is not an assembly.\");  \n        }  \n  \n        catch (System.IO.FileLoadException)  \n        {  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"The assembly has already been loaded.\");  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n/* Output (with .NET Framework 3.5 installed):  \n    Yes, the file is an assembly.  \n*/  \n```  \n  \n The <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName.GetAssemblyName%2A> method loads the test file, and then releases it once the information is read.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyName>   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Assemblies and the Global Assembly Cache (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/assemblies-gac/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,428],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a File Is an Assembly (C#) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Determine If a File Is an Assembly (C#) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a File Is an Assembly (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]}],"pos":[6,73],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Determine If a File Is an Assembly (C#) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
