Clients make calls to service operations and wait for a response from the service. You can perform calls to a service operation either synchronously, where the client blocks until it receives a response from the service or the call times, or asynchronously, where the client makes a call to the service operation, continues working, and receives the response from the service on another thread.  \n  \n To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract(Namespace=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]  \npublic interface IRequestReplyCalculator  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Add(double n1, double n2);  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n You do not have to set the  <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `false` because this is the default behavior.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [One-Way Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md)   \n [Duplex Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,51],"content":"Request-Reply Services | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Services | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[562,584],"content":"Request-Reply Services","linkify":"Request-Reply Services","nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Services","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Request-reply services are the default type of operation contract in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[585,710],"source":"Request-reply services are the default type of operation contract in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]."},{"content":"Clients make calls to service operations and wait for a response from the service.","pos":[711,793]},{"content":"You can perform calls to a service operation either synchronously, where the client blocks until it receives a response from the service or the call times, or asynchronously, where the client makes a call to the service operation, continues working, and receives the response from the service on another thread.","pos":[794,1105]},{"content":"To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute&gt;</ph> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code.","pos":[1112,1317],"source":"To create a request-reply service contract, define your service contract, and apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each operation, as shown in the following sample code."},{"pos":[1530,1681],"content":"You do not have to set the  <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph> because this is the default behavior.","source":"You do not have to set the  <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `false` because this is the default behavior."},{"pos":[1690,1698],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>One-Way Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1702,1789],"source":"[One-Way Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/one-way-services.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Duplex Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)</ept>","pos":[1792,1877],"source":" [Duplex Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/duplex-services.md)"}]}
