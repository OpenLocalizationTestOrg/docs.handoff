You can obtain this information by calling the `GetProperty` method on an implementation of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.IOnlineStatus> interface. An object with an implementation of this interface can monitor connection status or register for event handlers, such as `OnOnline` and `OnOffline`, and react immediately as changes to online status occur.  \n  \n In the Peer Channel infrastructure, a client is considered to be online if it is connected to at least one other peer and offline otherwise. This can be particularly useful in both debugging a developing applications or displaying detailed information to the end user.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  An online event handler should first ensure that the node is open before sending any messages.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Building a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,116],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Adding Online and Offline Status\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 05e5f51d-81b6-4c17-b364-9dda447a5fce","nodes":[{"content":"Adding Online and Offline Status","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"Adding Online and Offline Status","nodes":[{"content":"Adding Online and Offline Status","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[123,155],"content":"Adding Online and Offline Status","linkify":"Adding Online and Offline Status","nodes":[{"content":"Adding Online and Offline Status","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"In many cases, it is important for an application to monitor specific details about the status of a Peer Channel connection.","pos":[156,280]},{"content":"You can obtain this information by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">`GetProperty`</ph> method on an implementation of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.IOnlineStatus&gt;</ph> interface.","pos":[281,428],"source":" You can obtain this information by calling the `GetProperty` method on an implementation of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.IOnlineStatus> interface."},{"content":"An object with an implementation of this interface can monitor connection status or register for event handlers, such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`OnOnline`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`OnOffline`</ph>, and react immediately as changes to online status occur.","pos":[429,634],"source":" An object with an implementation of this interface can monitor connection status or register for event handlers, such as `OnOnline` and `OnOffline`, and react immediately as changes to online status occur."},{"content":"In the Peer Channel infrastructure, a client is considered to be online if it is connected to at least one other peer and offline otherwise.","pos":[641,781]},{"content":"This can be particularly useful in both debugging a developing applications or displaying detailed information to the end user.","pos":[782,909]},{"pos":[917,1022],"content":"[!NOTE]\n An online event handler should first ensure that the node is open before sending any messages.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"An online event handler should first ensure that the node is open before sending any messages.","pos":[9,103]}]},{"pos":[1031,1039],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1043,1167],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building a Peer Channel Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Building a Peer Channel Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/building-a-peer-channel-application.md)"}]}
