It can be read from a string, stream, URL, text reader, or a class derived from the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> method brings the document into memory and has overloaded methods available to take data from each of the different formats. There is also a <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.LoadXml%2A> method that reads XML from a string.  \n  \n Different <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> methods affect which nodes are created when the XML Document Object Model (DOM) is loaded. The following table lists the differences between some of the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A> methods and topics that address them.  \n  \n|Subject|Topic|  \n|-------------|-----------|  \n|Creation of white space nodes|The object used to load the DOM has an affect on the white space and significant white space nodes generated in the DOM. For more information, see [White Space and Significant White Space Handling when Loading the DOM](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/white-space-and-significant-white-space-handling-when-loading-the-dom.md).|  \n|Loading XML starting from a specific node or loading the entire XML document|Using the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method data can be loaded from a specific node into the DOM. For more information, see [Load Data from a Reader](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/load-data-from-a-reader.md).|  \n|Validating the XML as it is loaded|The XML data loaded into the DOM can be validated as it is loaded. This is accomplished using a validating <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. For more information about validating XML as it is loaded, see [Validating an XML Document in the DOM](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/validating-an-xml-document-in-the-dom.md).|  \n  \n The following example shows XML being loaded with the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.LoadXml%2A> method and the data subsequently saved to a text file called `data.xml`.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \n  \nPublic Class Sample  \n  \n    Public Shared Sub Main()  \n        ' Create the XmlDocument.  \n        Dim doc As New XmlDocument()  \n
