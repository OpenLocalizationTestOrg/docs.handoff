This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Timer Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/timer-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component, which allows you to set up your application to respond to periodic events.  \n  \n [Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)  \n Describes known limitations of the timer's interval that may affect how you can use it.  \n  \n [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md)  \n Describes how to react to timed intervals in your Windows-based applications.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class  \n Provides reference information on the class, used for Windows Forms timers, and its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Timers.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class  \n Provides reference information on the <xref:System.Timers.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class that is used by server-based timers.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [Timer Control for Visual Basic 6.0 Users](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/38e5184a-1e50-45cf-b936-dae566c0cfc5)  \n Describes how timer functionality has changed in Visual Basic as compared to previous versions.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,60],"content":"Timer Component (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component (Windows Forms) | Microsoft
