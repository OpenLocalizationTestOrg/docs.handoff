You can also customize the XML stream by deriving from an existing class and instructing the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> instance how to serialize the new class.  \n  \n For example, given a `Book` class, you can derive from it and create an `ExpandedBook` class that has a few more properties. However, you must instruct the **XmlSerializer** to accept the derived type when serializing or deserializing. This can be done by creating a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute> instance and setting its **Type** property to the derived class type. Add the **XmlElementAttribute** to a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAttributes> instance. Then add the **XmlAttributes** to a <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlAttributeOverrides> instance, specifying the type being overridden and the name of the member that accepts the derived class. This is shown in the following example.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Class Orders  \n    public Books() As Book  \nEnd Class     \n  \nPublic Class Book  \n    public ISBN As String   \nEnd Class  \n  \nPublic Class ExpandedBook  \n    Inherits Book  \n    public NewEdition As Boolean  \nEnd Class  \n  \nPublic Class Run  \n    Shared Sub Main()  \n        Dim t As Run = New Run()  \n        t.SerializeObject(\"Book.xml\")  \n        t.DeserializeObject(\"Book.xml\")  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public Sub SerializeObject(filename As String)  \n        ' Each overridden field, property, or type requires   \n        ' an XmlAttributes instance.   \n        Dim attrs As XmlAttributes = New XmlAttributes()  \n  \n        ' Creates an XmlElementAttribute instance to override the   \n        ' field that returns Book objects.
