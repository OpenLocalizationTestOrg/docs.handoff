Use one of the following options to continue executing instructions while waiting for an asynchronous operation to complete:  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.IsCompleted%2A> property of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> returned by the asynchronous operation's **Begin** *OperationName* method to determine whether the operation has completed. This approach is known as polling and is demonstrated in this topic.  \n  \n-   Use an <xref:System.AsyncCallback> delegate to process the results of the asynchronous operation in a separate thread. For an example that demonstrates this approach, see [Using an AsyncCallback Delegate to End an Asynchronous Operation](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/using-an-asynccallback-delegate-to-end-an-asynchronous-operation.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates using asynchronous methods in the <xref:System.Net.Dns> class to retrieve Domain Name System information for a user-specified computer. This example starts the asynchronous operation and then prints periods (\".\") at the console until the operation is complete. Note that **null** (**Nothing** in Visual Basic) is passed for the <xref:System.Net.Dns.BeginGetHostByName%2A><xref:System.AsyncCallback> and <xref:System.Object> parameters because these arguments are not required when using this approach.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[AsyncDesignPattern#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AsyncDesignPattern/CS/Async_Poll.cs#3)]\n
