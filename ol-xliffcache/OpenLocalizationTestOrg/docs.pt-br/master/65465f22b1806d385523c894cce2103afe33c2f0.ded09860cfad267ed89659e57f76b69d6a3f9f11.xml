The following sections describe the scenarios and configurations that Windows Forms applications and controls support and those that they do not support.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Windows Forms and Unmanaged Applications Overview](windows-forms-and-unmanaged-applications-overview.md)  \n Offers general information about how to use and implement Windows Forms controls that work with unmanaged applications.  \n  \n [How to: Support COM Interop by Displaying a Windows Form with the ShowDialog Method](com-interop-by-displaying-a-windows-form-shadow.md)  \n Provides a code example that shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to run a Windows Form in an unmanaged application.  \n  \n [How to: Support COM Interop by Displaying Each Windows Form on Its Own Thread](how-to-support-com-interop-by-displaying-each-windows-form-on-its-own-thread.md)  \n Provides a code example that shows how to run a Windows Form on its own thread.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Supporting COM Interop by Displaying Each Windows Form on Its Own Thread](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/ms233639(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  \n Used to create a separate thread for a Windows Form.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Run%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  \n Starts a message loop for a thread.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A>  \n Marshals calls from an unmanaged application to a form.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Exposing .NET Framework Components to COM](../../interop/exposing-dotnet-components-to-com.md)  \n Offers general information about how to use .NET Framework types in unmanaged applications.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,320],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Windows Forms and Unmanaged Applications\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
