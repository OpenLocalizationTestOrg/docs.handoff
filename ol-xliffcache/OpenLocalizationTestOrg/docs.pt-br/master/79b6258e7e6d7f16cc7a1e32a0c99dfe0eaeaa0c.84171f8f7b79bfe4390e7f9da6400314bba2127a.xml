You can create a thumbnail image by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.GetThumbnailImage%2A> method of an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from a JPG file. The original image has a width of 640 pixels and a height of 479 pixels. The code creates a thumbnail image that has a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the thumbnail image.  \n  \n ![Thumbnail Image](./media/thumbnail1.png \"Thumbnail1\")  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In this example, a callback method is declared, but never used. This supports all versions of GDI+.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#71](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/CS/Class1.cs#71)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#71](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/VB/Class1.vb#71)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler. To run the example, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Create a new Windows Forms application.  \n  \n2.  Add the example code to the form.  \n  \n3.  Create a handler for the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event  \n  \n4.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> handler, call the `GetThumbnail` method and pass `e` for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>.  \n  \n5.  Find an image file that you want to make a thumbnail of.  \n  \n6.  In the `GetThumbnail` method, specify the path and file name to your image.  \n  \n7.  Press F5 to run the example.  \n  \n     A 100 by 100 thumbnail image appears on the form.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)\n- [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,270],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create Thumbnail Images\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"thumbnail images [Windows Forms], creating\"\n  - \"images [Windows Forms], creating thumbnails\"\nms.assetid: e956242a-1e5b-4217-a3cf-5f3fb45d00ba","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","nodes":[{"pos":[0,31],"content":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","pos":[0,31]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[277,308],"content":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","linkify":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Thumbnail Images","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"A thumbnail image is a small version of an image.","pos":[309,358]},{"content":"You can create a thumbnail image by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image.GetThumbnailImage%2A&gt;</ph> method of an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[359,504],"source":" You can create a thumbnail image by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.GetThumbnailImage%2A> method of an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object."},{"pos":[513,520],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example constructs an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image&gt;</ph> object from a JPG file.","pos":[524,611],"source":"The following example constructs an <xref:System.Drawing.Image> object from a JPG file."},{"content":"The original image has a width of 640 pixels and a height of 479 pixels.","pos":[612,684]},{"content":"The code creates a thumbnail image that has a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.","pos":[685,778]},{"content":"The following illustration shows the thumbnail image.","pos":[785,838]},{"pos":[845,900],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Thumbnail Image<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/thumbnail1.png \"</bpt>Thumbnail1<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Thumbnail Image](./media/thumbnail1.png \"Thumbnail1\")"},{"pos":[908,1018],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In this example, a callback method is declared, but never used.
