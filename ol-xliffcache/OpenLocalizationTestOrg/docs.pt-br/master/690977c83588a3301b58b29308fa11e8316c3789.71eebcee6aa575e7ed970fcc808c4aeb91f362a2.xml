When you call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A>, the common language runtime throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> in the target thread, which the target thread can catch. For more information, see <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If a thread is executing unmanaged code when its <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method is called, the runtime marks it <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState?displayProperty=fullName>. The exception is thrown when the thread returns to managed code.  \n  \n Once a thread is aborted, it cannot be restarted.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method does not cause the thread to abort immediately, because the target thread can catch the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> and execute arbitrary amounts of code in a `finally` block. You can call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A?displayProperty=fullName> if you need to wait until the thread has ended. <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A?displayProperty=fullName> is a blocking call that does not return until the thread has actually stopped executing or an optional timeout interval has elapsed. The aborted thread could call the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A> method or perform unbounded processing in a `finally` block, so if you do not specify a timeout, the wait is not guaranteed to end.  \n  \n Threads that are waiting on a call to the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Join%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method can be interrupted by other threads that call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Interrupt%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n## Handling ThreadAbortException  \n If you expect your thread to be aborted, either as a result of calling <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> from your own code or as a result of unloading an application domain in which the thread is running (<xref:System.AppDomain.Unload%2A?displayProperty=fullName> uses <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to terminate threads), your thread must handle the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> and perform any final processing in a `finally` clause, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n```vb  \nTry  \n    ' Code that is executing when the thread is aborted.  \nCatch ex As ThreadAbortException  \n    ' Clean-up code can go here.  \n    ' If there is no Finally clause, ThreadAbortException is  \n    ' re-thrown by the system at the end of the Catch clause.   \nFinally  \n    ' Clean-up code can go here.  \nEnd Try  \n' Do not put clean-up code here, because the exception   \n' is rethrown at the end of the Finally clause.  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \ntry   \n{  \n    // Code that is executing when the thread is aborted.  \n}   \ncatch (ThreadAbortException ex)   \n{  \n    // Clean-up code can go here.  \n    // If there is no Finally clause, ThreadAbortException is  \n    // re-thrown by the system at the end of the Catch clause.   \n}  \n// Do not put clean-up code here, because the exception   \n// is rethrown at the end of the Finally clause.  \n```  \n  \n Your clean-up code must be in the `catch` clause or the `finally` clause, because a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> is rethrown by the system at the end of the `finally` clause, or at the end of the `catch` clause if there is no `finally` clause.  \n  \n You can prevent the system from rethrowing the exception by calling the <xref:System.Threading.Thread.ResetAbort%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. However, you should do this only if your own code caused the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException>   \n <xref:System.Threading.Thread>   \n [Using Threads and Threading](../../../docs/standard/threading/using-threads-and-threading.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,47],"content":"Destroying Threads | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Destroying Threads | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[439,457],"content":"Destroying Threads","linkify":"Destroying Threads","nodes":[{"content":"Destroying Threads","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A&gt;</ph> method is used to stop a managed thread permanently.","pos":[458,554],"source":"The <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method is used to stop a managed thread permanently."},{"content":"When you call <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A&gt;</ph>, the common language runtime throws a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException&gt;</ph> in the target thread, which the target thread can catch.","pos":[555,748],"source":" When you call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A>, the common language runtime throws a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException> in the target thread, which the target thread can catch."},{"content":"For more information, see <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>.","pos":[749,840],"source":" For more information, see <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A?displayProperty=fullName>."},{"pos":[848,1113],"content":"[!NOTE]\n If a thread is executing unmanaged code when its <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Abort%2A> method is called, the runtime marks it <xref:System.Threading.ThreadState?displayProperty=fullName>.
