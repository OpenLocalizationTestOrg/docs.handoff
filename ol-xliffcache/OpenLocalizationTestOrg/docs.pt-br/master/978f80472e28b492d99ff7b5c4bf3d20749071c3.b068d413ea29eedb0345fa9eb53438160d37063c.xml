This applies not only to the members but also to the implementation, inheritance, and access level.  \n  \n To override a procedure or property, a class must inherit it from a base class. Therefore, to specify `MustOverride` for a procedure or property in a base class, you must specify `MustInherit` for the class. Because they are mutually contradictory, you cannot specify both `MustInherit` and `NotInheritable` for the same class.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30927  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the property or procedure must be overridden, then remove the `NotInheritable` keyword from the partial declaration in which it appears.  \n  \n-   If the class must be `NotInheritable`, then remove the `MustOverride` keyword from the procedure or property. You cannot override it because you cannot inherit the class.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Partial](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/partial.md)   \n [MustOverride](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustoverride.md)   \n [MustInherit](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/mustinherit.md)   \n [NotInheritable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/notinheritable.md)   \n [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,210],"content":"&#39;MustOverride&#39;
