A value or an expression that evaluates to the number of elements of the sequence to skip.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `Skip` clause causes a query to bypass elements at the beginning of a results list and return the remaining elements. The number of elements to skip is identified by the `count` parameter.  \n  \n You can use the `Skip` clause with the `Take` clause to return a range of data from any segment of a query. To do this, pass the index of the first element of the range to the `Skip` clause and the size of the range to the `Take` clause.  \n  \n When you use the `Skip` clause in a query, you may also need to ensure that the results are returned in an order that will enable the `Skip` clause to bypass the intended results. For more information about ordering query results, see [Order By Clause](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/order-by-clause.md).  \n  \n You can use the `SkipWhile` clause to specify that only certain elements are ignored, depending on a supplied condition.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example uses the `Skip` clause together with the `Take` clause to return data from a query in pages. The `GetCustomers` function uses the `Skip` clause to bypass the customers in the list until the supplied starting index value, and uses the `Take` clause to return a page of customers starting from that index value.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbSimpleQuerySamples#1](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/codesnippet/VisualBasic/skip-clause_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to LINQ in
