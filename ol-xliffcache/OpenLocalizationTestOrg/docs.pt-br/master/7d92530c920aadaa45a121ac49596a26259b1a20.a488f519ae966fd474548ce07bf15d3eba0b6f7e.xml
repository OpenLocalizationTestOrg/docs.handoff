This performance consideration is particularly important in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app or [!INCLUDE[desktop_appname](../../../includes/desktop-appname-md.md)] app where a time-consuming stream operation can block the UI thread and make your app appear as if it is not working.  \n  \n Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)], the I/O types include async methods to simplify asynchronous operations. An async method contains `Async` in its name, such as <xref:System.IO.Stream.ReadAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.Stream.WriteAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.Stream.CopyToAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.Stream.FlushAsync%2A>, <xref:System.IO.TextReader.ReadLineAsync%2A>, and <xref:System.IO.TextReader.ReadToEndAsync%2A>. These async methods are implemented on stream classes, such as <xref:System.IO.Stream>, <xref:System.IO.FileStream>, and <xref:System.IO.MemoryStream>, and on classes that are used for reading from or writing to streams, such <xref:System.IO.TextReader> and <xref:System.IO.TextWriter>.  \n  \n In the .NET Framework 4 and earlier versions, you have to use methods such as <xref:System.IO.Stream.BeginRead%2A> and <xref:System.IO.Stream.EndRead%2A> to implement asynchronous I/O operations. These methods are still available in the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] to support legacy code; however, the async methods help you implement asynchronous I/O operations more easily.  \n  \n Starting with [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../../../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)], Visual Studio provides two keywords for asynchronous programming:  \n  \n `Async` (Visual Basic) or `async` (C#) modifier, which is used to mark a method that contains an asynchronous operation.  \n  \n `Await` (Visual Basic) or `await` (C#) operator, which is applied to the result of an async method.  \n  \n To implement asynchronous I/O operations, use these keywords in conjunction with the async methods, as shown in the following examples. For more information, see [Asynchronous Programming with Async and Await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/db854f91-ccef-4035-ae4d-0911fde808c7).  \n  \n The following example demonstrates how to use two <xref:System.IO.FileStream> objects to copy files asynchronously from one directory to another. Notice that the <xref:System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button.Click> event handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control is marked with the `async` modifier because it calls an asynchronous method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Asynchronous_File_IO_async/cs/example.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Asynchronous_File_IO_async/vb/example.vb#1)]  \n  \n The next example is similar to the previous one but uses <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> and <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> objects to read and write the contents of a text file asynchronously.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/Asynchronous_File_IO_async/cs/example2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[Asynchronous_File_IO_async#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/Asynchronous_File_IO_async/vb/example2.vb#2)]  \n  \n The next example shows the code-behind file and the XAML file that are used to open a file as a <xref:System.IO.Stream> in a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../../../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] app, and read its contents by using an instance of the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> class. It uses asynchronous methods to open the file as a stream and to read its contents.  \n  \n
