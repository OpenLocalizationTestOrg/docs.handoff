This example is described in detail in [Implementing Virtual Mode with Just-In-Time Data Loading in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](implementing-virtual-mode-jit-data-loading-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading#000](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading/CS/lazyloading.cs#000)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading#000](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Virtual_lazyloading/VB/lazyloading.vb#000)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Xml, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n-   Access to a server with the Northwind SQL Server sample database installed.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n-
