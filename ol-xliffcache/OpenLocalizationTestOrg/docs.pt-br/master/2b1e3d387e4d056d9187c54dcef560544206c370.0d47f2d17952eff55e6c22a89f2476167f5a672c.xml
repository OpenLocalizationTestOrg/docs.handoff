For example, a triangle is a polygon with three sides, a rectangle is a polygon with four sides, and a pentagon is a polygon with five sides. The following illustration shows several polygons.  \n  \n ![Polygons](./media/aboutgdip02-art07.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art07\")  \n  \n## Drawing a Polygon  \n To draw a polygon, you need a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object, and an array of <xref:System.Drawing.Point> (or <xref:System.Drawing.PointF>) objects. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPolygon%2A> method. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as width and color, of the line used to render the polygon, and the array of <xref:System.Drawing.Point> objects stores the points to be connected by straight lines. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object and the array of <xref:System.Drawing.Point> objects are passed as arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPolygon%2A> method. The following example draws a three-sided polygon. Note that there are only three points in `myPointArray`: (0, 0), (50, 30), and (30, 60). The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPolygon%2A> method automatically closes the polygon by drawing a line from (30, 60) back to the starting point (0, 0).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#111](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#111)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#111](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#111)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the polygon.  \n  \n ![Polygon](./media/aboutgdip02-art08.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art08\")  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Pen?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](lines-curves-and-shapes.md)\n- [How to: Create a Pen](how-to-create-a-pen.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,232],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Polygons in GDI+\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
