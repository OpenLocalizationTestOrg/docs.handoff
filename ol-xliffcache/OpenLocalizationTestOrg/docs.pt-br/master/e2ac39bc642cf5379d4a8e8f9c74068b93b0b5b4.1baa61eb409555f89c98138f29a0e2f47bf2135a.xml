It is generally used in classes that contain static members only. If a class has one or more private constructors and no public constructors, other classes (except nested classes) cannot create instances of this class. For example:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#11](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/private-constructors_1.cs)]  \n  \n The declaration of the empty constructor prevents the automatic generation of a default constructor. Note that if you do not use an access modifier with the constructor it will still be private by default. However, the [private](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/private.md) modifier is usually used explicitly to make it clear that the class cannot be instantiated.  \n  \n Private constructors are used to prevent creating instances of a class when there are no instance fields or methods, such as the <xref:System.Math> class, or when a method is called to obtain an instance of a class. If all the methods in the class are static, consider making the complete class static. For more information see [Static Classes and Static Class Members](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-classes-and-static-class-members.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following is an example of a class using a private constructor.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#12](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/private-constructors_2.cs)]  \n  \n Notice that if you uncomment the following statement from the example, it will generate an error because the constructor is inaccessible because of its protection level:  \n  \n
