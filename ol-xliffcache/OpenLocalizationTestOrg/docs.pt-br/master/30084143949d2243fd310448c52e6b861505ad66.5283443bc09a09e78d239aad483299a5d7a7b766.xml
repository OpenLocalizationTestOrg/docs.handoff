This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzProgressAssemblyName`.  \n  \n `pwzErrorAssemblyName`  \n  \n [out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied error user interface.  \n  \n `pwzErrorClassName`  \n  \n [out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element. This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzErrorAssemblyName`.  \n  \n## Property Value/Return Value  \n HRESULT: Ignored.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A host application may have a specific theme that PresentationHost.exe’s default user interfaces may not conform to. If this is the case, the host application can implement [GetCustomUI](getcustomui.md) to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe. PresentationHost.exe will always call [GetCustomUI](getcustomui.md) before using its default user interfaces.  \n  \n This function is called once during PresentationHost’s initialization.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [IWpfHostSupport](iwpfhostsupport.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,151],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"GetCustomUI\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"custom error messages [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: e55180fc-35bb-4f80-a136-772b5eb3e4e5","nodes":[{"content":"GetCustomUI","nodes":[{"pos":[0,11],"content":"GetCustomUI","nodes":[{"content":"GetCustomUI","pos":[0,11]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[158,169],"content":"GetCustomUI","linkify":"GetCustomUI","nodes":[{"content":"GetCustomUI","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Called by PresentationHost.exe to get custom progress and error messages from the host, if implemented.","pos":[170,273]},{"pos":[282,288],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[473,483],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied progress user interface.","pos":[519,607]},{"content":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied progress user interface, preferably a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)]</ph> file with <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is its top-level element.","pos":[643,886],"source":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied progress user interface, preferably a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_titlexaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-titlexaml-md.md)] file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element."},{"content":"This class resides in the assembly that is specified by <ph id=\"ph1\">`pwzProgressAssemblyName`</ph>.","pos":[887,969],"source":" This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzProgressAssemblyName`."},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the assembly that contains the host-supplied error user interface.","pos":[1005,1090]},{"content":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is its top-level element.","pos":[1123,1288],"source":"[out] The name of the class that is the host-supplied error user interface, preferably a XAML file with <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is its top-level element."},{"content":"This class resides in the assembly that is specified by <ph id=\"ph1\">`pwzErrorAssemblyName`</ph>.","pos":[1289,1368],"source":" This class resides in the assembly that is specified by `pwzErrorAssemblyName`."},{"pos":[1377,1404],"content":"Property Value/Return Value","linkify":"Property Value/Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Property Value/Return Value","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"HRESULT: Ignored.","pos":[1408,1425]},{"pos":[1434,1441],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"A host application may have a specific theme that PresentationHost.exe’s default user interfaces may not conform to.","pos":[1445,1561]},{"content":"If this is the case, the host application can implement <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetCustomUI<ept id=\"p1\">](getcustomui.md)</ept> to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe.","pos":[1562,1717],"source":" If this is the case, the host application can implement [GetCustomUI](getcustomui.md) to return progress and error user interfaces to PresentationHost.exe."},{"content":"PresentationHost.exe will always call <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetCustomUI<ept id=\"p1\">](getcustomui.md)</ept> before using its default user interfaces.","pos":[1718,1827],"source":" PresentationHost.exe will always call [GetCustomUI](getcustomui.md) before using its default user interfaces."},{"content":"This function is called once during PresentationHost’s initialization.","pos":[1834,1904]},{"pos":[1913,1921],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1925,1962],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>IWpfHostSupport<ept id=\"p1\">](iwpfhostsupport.md)</ept>","source":"[IWpfHostSupport](iwpfhostsupport.md)"}]}
