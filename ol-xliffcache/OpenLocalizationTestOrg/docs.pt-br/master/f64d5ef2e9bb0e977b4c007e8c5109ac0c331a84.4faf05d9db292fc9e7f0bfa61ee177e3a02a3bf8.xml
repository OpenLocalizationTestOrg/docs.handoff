This is in addition to any security schemas that may be in place already on your computer system. These can include those in the browser (such as the zone-based security available in Internet Explorer) or the operating system (such as the credential-based security of Windows NT).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Security in Windows Forms Overview](security-in-windows-forms-overview.md)  \n Briefly explains the .NET Framework security model and the basic steps necessary to ensure the Windows Forms in your application are secure.  \n  \n [More Secure File and Data Access in Windows Forms](more-secure-file-and-data-access-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes how to access files and data in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n [More Secure Printing in Windows Forms](more-secure-printing-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes how to access printing features in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n [Additional Security Considerations in Windows Forms](additional-security-considerations-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes performing window manipulation, using the Clipboard, and making calls to unmanaged code in a semi-trusted environment.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Default Security Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/03kwzyfc(v=vs.100))  \n Lists the default permissions granted in the Full Trust, Local Intranet, and Internet permission sets.  \n  \n [General Security Policy Administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ed5htz45(v=vs.100))  \n Gives information about the administering the .NET Framework security policy and elevating permissions.  \n  \n [Dangerous Permissions and Policy Administration](../misc/dangerous-permissions-and-policy-administration.md)  \n Discusses some of the.NET Framework permissions that can potentially allow the security system to be circumvented.  \n  \n [Secure Coding Guidelines](../../standard/security/secure-coding-guidelines.md)  \n Links to topics that explain the best practices for securely writing code against the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [Requesting Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/yd267cce(v=vs.100))  \n Discusses the use of attributes to let the runtime know what permissions your code needs to run.  \n  \n [Key Security Concepts](../../standard/security/key-security-concepts.md)  \n Links to topics that cover the basic aspects of code security.  \n  \n [Code Access Security Basics](../misc/code-access-security-basics.md)  \n Discusses the basics of working with the .NET Framework run time security policy.  \n  \n [Determining When to Modify Security Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/xky659fc(v=vs.100))  \n Explains how to determine when your applications need to diverge from the default security policy.  \n  \n [Deploying Security Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/13wcxx6y(v=vs.100))  \n Discusses the best manner for deploying security policy changes.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,390],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Windows Forms Security\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
