It is implemented on the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>, <xref:System.Xml.XmlDataDocument>, and <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument>. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is based upon the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Data Model as described in section 5 of the XML Path Language (XPath) recommendation.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> defines a cursor model over any store and provides fast, read-only XPath queries over any data store. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is also the class to use for iterating over result tree fragments.  \n  \n The API enables you to get information from the current node in the store and move to connected nodes. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is a cursor style model that performs traversal over a store using a set of **Move** methods. The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is always positioned on a node. Any **Move** method that fails leaves the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> unchanged.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNavigator> is the class to use for iterating over result tree fragments. The following code sample creates a result tree fragment within a style sheet by calling the function with the parameter, `fragment`, which contains XML.  \n  \n## test.xsl  \n  \n```  \n<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"  \n                xmlns:msxsl =\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt\"  \n                xmlns:user=\"http://www.adventure-works.com\"

\n  \n## test.xml  \n  \n```  \n<root>Some text</root>  \n```  \n  \n The following code uses the **test.xsl** style sheet and **test.xml** input data.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports
