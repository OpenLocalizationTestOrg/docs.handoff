The program displays the string `Hello World!`  \n  \n For more examples of introductory concepts, see [Getting Started with Visual C# and Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/getting-started-with-visual-csharp-and-visual-basic).  \n  \n[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  \n  \n### To create and run a console application  \n  \n1.  Start Visual Studio.  \n  \n2.  On the menu bar, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.  \n  \n     The **New Project** dialog box opens.  \n  \n3.  Expand **Installed**, expand **Templates**, expand **Visual C#**, and then choose **Console Application**.  \n  \n4.  In the **Name** box, specify a name for your project, and then choose the **OK** button.  \n  \n     The new project appears in **Solution Explorer**.  \n  \n5.  If Program.cs isn't open in the **Code Editor**, open the shortcut menu for **Program.cs** in **Solution Explorer**, and then choose **View Code**.  \n  \n6.  Replace the contents of Program.cs with the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuide#21](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_1.cs)]  \n  \n7.  Choose the F5 key to run the project. A Command Prompt window appears that contains the line `Hello World!`  \n  \n Next, the important parts of this program are examined.  \n  \n## Comments  \n The first line contains a comment. The characters `//` convert the rest of the line to a comment.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuide#32](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_2.cs)]  \n  \n You can also comment out a block of text by enclosing it between the `/*` and `*/` characters. This is shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuide#33](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_3.cs)]  \n  \n## Main Method  \n A C# console application must contain a `Main` method, in which control starts and ends. The `Main` method is where you create objects and execute other methods.  \n  \n The `Main` method is a [static](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/static.md) method that resides inside a class or a struct. In the previous \"Hello World!\" example, it resides in a class named `Hello`. You can declare the `Main` method in one of the following ways:  \n  \n-   It can return `void`.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideMain#12](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_4.cs)]  \n  \n-   It can also return an integer.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideMain#13](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_5.cs)]  \n  \n-   With either of the return types, it can take arguments.  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideMain#19](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_6.cs)]  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideMain#18](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_7.cs)]  \n  \n The parameter of the `Main` method, `args`, is a `string` array that contains the command-line arguments used to invoke the program. Unlike in C++, the array does not include the name of the executable (exe) file.  \n  \n For more information about how to use command-line arguments, see the examples in [Main() and Command-Line Arguments](../../../csharp/programming-guide/main-and-command-args/index.md) and [How to: Create and Use Assemblies Using the Command Line](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/70f65026-3687-4e9c-ab79-c18b97dd8be4).  \n  \n The call to <xref:System.Console.ReadKey%2A> at the end of the `Main` method prevents the console window from closing before you have a chance to read the output when you run your program in debug mode, by pressing F5.  \n  \n## Input and Output  \n C# programs generally use the input/output services provided by the run-time library of the .NET Framework. The statement `System.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");` uses the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A> method. This is one of the output methods of the <xref:System.Console> class in the run-time library. It displays its string parameter on the standard output stream followed by a new line. Other <xref:System.Console> methods are available for different input and output operations. If you include the `using System;` directive at the beginning of the program, you can directly use the <xref:System> classes and methods without fully qualifying them. For example, you can call `Console.WriteLine` instead of `System.Console.WriteLine`:  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuide#1](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_8.cs)]  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuide#23](../../../csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/codesnippet/CSharp/hello-world-your-first-program_9.cs)]  \n  \n For more information about input/output methods, see <xref:System.IO>.  \n  \n## Command-Line Compilation and Execution  \n You can compile the \"Hello World!\" program by using the command line instead of the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  \n  \n#### To compile and run from a command prompt  \n  \n1.  Paste the code from the preceding procedure into any text editor, and then save the file as a text file. Name the file `Hello.cs`. C# source code files use the extension `.cs`.  \n  \n2.  Perform one of the following steps to open a command-prompt window:  \n  \n    -   In Windows 8, on the **Start** screen, search for `Developer Command Prompt`, and then tap or choose **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012**.  \n  \n         A Developer Command Prompt window appears.  \n  \n    -   In Windows 7, open the **Start** menu, expand the folder for the current version of Visual Studio, open the shortcut menu for **Visual Studio Tools**, and then choose **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012**.  \n  \n         A Developer Command Prompt window appears.  \n  \n    -   Enable command-line builds from a standard Command Prompt window.  \n  \n         See [How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md).  \n  \n3.  In the command-prompt window, navigate to the folder that contains your `Hello.cs` file.  \n  \n4.  Enter the following command to compile `Hello.cs`.  \n  \n     `csc Hello.cs`  \n  \n     If your program has no compilation errors, an executable file that is named `Hello.exe` is created.  \n  \n5.  In the command-prompt window, enter the following command to run the program:  \n  \n     `Hello`  \n  \n For more information about the C# compiler and its options, see [C# Compiler
