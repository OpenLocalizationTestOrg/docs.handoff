Tables and columns that are part of the **DataSet** can be accessed using user-friendly names and strongly typed variables.  \n  \n A typed **DataSet** is a class that derives from a **DataSet**. As such, it inherits all the methods, events, and properties of a **DataSet**. Additionally, a typed **DataSet** provides strongly typed methods, events, and properties. This means you can access tables and columns by name, instead of using collection-based methods. Aside from the improved readability of the code, a typed **DataSet** also allows the Visual Studio .NET code editor to automatically complete lines as you type.  \n  \n Additionally, the strongly typed **DataSet** provides access to values as the correct type at compile time. With a strongly typed **DataSet**, type mismatch errors are caught when the code is compiled rather than at run time.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Generating Strongly Typed DataSets](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/generating-strongly-typed-datasets.md)  \n Describes how to create and use a strongly typed **DataSet**.  \n  \n [Annotating Typed DataSets](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/annotating-typed-datasets.md)  \n Describes how to annotate the XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema used to generate a strongly typed **DataSet**, to give **DataSet** elements friendly names without altering the underlying schema.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [DataSets, DataTables, and
