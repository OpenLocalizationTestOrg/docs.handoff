[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is responsible for displaying information on screens and printers. As its name suggests, [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is the successor to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)], the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows.  \n  \n## Managed Class Interface  \n The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API is exposed through a set of classes deployed as managed code. This set of classes is called the *managed class interface* to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]. The following namespaces make up the managed class interface:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Text>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Printing>  \n  \n With a Graphics Device Interface, such as [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device. The programmer makes calls to methods provided by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes. Those methods, in turn, make the appropriate calls to specific device drivers. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] insulates the application from the graphics hardware. It is this insulation that enables a programmer to create device-independent applications.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Graphics Overview](graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,229],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Overview of Graphics\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"graphics [Windows Forms], using managed interface\"\n  - \"graphics [Windows Forms], about graphics\"\nms.assetid: a602aef8-a8c8-4c36-9816-74e7bad96a68","nodes":[{"content":"Overview of Graphics","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"Overview of Graphics","nodes":[{"content":"Overview of Graphics","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[236,256],"content":"Overview of Graphics","linkify":"Overview of Graphics","nodes":[{"content":"Overview of Graphics","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> is an application programming interface (API) that forms the subsystem of the Microsoft Windows operating system.","pos":[257,438],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is an application programming interface (API) that forms the subsystem of the Microsoft Windows operating system."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> is responsible for displaying information on screens and printers.","pos":[439,573],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is responsible for displaying information on screens and printers."},{"content":"As its name suggests, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> is the successor to <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)]</ph>, the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows.","pos":[574,817],"source":" As its name suggests, [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is the successor to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)], the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows."},{"pos":[826,849],"content":"Managed Class Interface","linkify":"Managed Class Interface","nodes":[{"content":"Managed Class Interface","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> API is exposed through a set of classes deployed as managed code.","pos":[853,990],"source":"The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API is exposed through a set of classes deployed as managed code."},{"content":"This set of classes is called the <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>managed class interface<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> to <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[991,1122],"source":" This set of classes is called the *managed class interface* to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]."},{"content":"The following namespaces make up the managed class interface:","pos":[1123,1184]},{"content":"With a Graphics Device Interface, such as <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph>, you can display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device.","pos":[1378,1620],"source":"With a Graphics Device Interface, such as [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)], you can display information on a screen or printer without having to be concerned about the details of a particular display device."},{"content":"The programmer makes calls to methods provided by <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> classes.","pos":[1621,1747],"source":" The programmer makes calls to methods provided by [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes."},{"content":"Those methods, in turn, make the appropriate calls to specific device drivers.","pos":[1748,1826]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> insulates the application from the graphics hardware.","pos":[1827,1948],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] insulates the application from the graphics hardware."},{"content":"It is this insulation that enables a programmer to create device-independent applications.","pos":[1949,2039]},{"pos":[2048,2056],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2060,2115],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Graphics Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Graphics Overview](graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)"}]}
