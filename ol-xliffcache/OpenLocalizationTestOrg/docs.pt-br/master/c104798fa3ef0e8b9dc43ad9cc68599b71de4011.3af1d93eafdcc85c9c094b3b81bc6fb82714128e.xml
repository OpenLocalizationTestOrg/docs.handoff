For more information about sessions in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, see [Using Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-sessions.md).  \n  \n### To specify that a contract require its binding to support sessions  \n  \n1.  Create a service contract with at least one operation. For an example of how to create a service contract, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md).  \n  \n2.  Modify the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType> that declares the contract by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property to either:  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.Required?displayProperty=nameWithType> if this contract must be run within a session.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.Allowed?displayProperty=nameWithType> if this contract can be run within a session.  \n  \n    -   <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode.NotAllowed?displayProperty=nameWithType> if this contract must not be run within a session.  \n  \n3.  Configure your service endpoint to use a binding that supports sessions. The following configuration example shows the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding?displayProperty=nameWithType>, which supports a WS`-`ReliableMessaging session.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[SCA.Session#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/cs/hostapplication.exe.config#2)]   \n  \n## Example  \n The following example code shows how to specify a contract-level session requirement and use a configuration file to support that requirement with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding?displayProperty=nameWithType> binding.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[SCA.Session#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/cs/services.cs#1)] \n [!code-vb[SCA.Session#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/vb/services.vb#1)]      \n [!code-xml[SCA.Session#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/sca.session/cs/hostapplication.exe.config#2)]     \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute.SessionMode%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.SessionMode?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Service That Requires Sessions\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
