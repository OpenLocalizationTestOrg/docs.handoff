For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object. Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case. `Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties. `WithEvents` is not supported for private`UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)   \n [Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,79],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]},{"pos":[567,617],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","linkify":"Object or class does not support the set of events","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"You tried to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events.","pos":[618,744],"source":"You tried to use a `WithEvents` variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events."},{"content":"For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that <ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> the first object.","pos":[745,864],"source":" For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object."},{"content":"Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case.","pos":[865,973]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> only implements an interface for methods and properties.","pos":[974,1043],"source":"`Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> is not supported for private<ph id=\"ph2\">`UserControls`</ph>, because the type info needed to raise the <ph id=\"ph3\">`ObjectEvent`</ph> is not available at run time.","pos":[1044,1186],"source":"`WithEvents` is not supported for private`UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time."},{"pos":[1195,1216],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.","pos":[1226,1293]},{"pos":[1302,1310],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WithEvents<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1314,1393],"source":"[WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Implements Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1396,1496],"source":" [Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)"}]}
