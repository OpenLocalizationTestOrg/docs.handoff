        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, all managed code that calls into unmanaged code must have <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>SecurityPermission<ept id="p1">**</ept> with the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>UnmanagedCode<ept id="p2">**</ept> flag specified.</source>

        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You can also use assertions in situations in which your code accesses a resource in a way that is completely hidden from callers.</source>

        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, suppose your library acquires information from a database, but in the process also reads information from the computer registry.</source>

        <trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because developers using your library do not have access to your source, they have no way of knowing that their code requires <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>RegistryPermission<ept id="p1">**</ept> in order to use your code.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this case, if you decide that it is not reasonable or necessary to require that callers of your code have permission to access the registry, you can assert permission for reading the registry.</source>

        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this situation, it is appropriate for the library to assert the permission so that callers without <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>RegistryPermission<ept id="p1">**</ept> can use the library.</source>

        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The assertion affects the stack walk only if the asserted permission and a permission demanded by a downstream caller are of the same type and if the demanded permission is a subset of the asserted permission.</source>

        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, if you assert <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>FileIOPermission<ept id="p1">**</ept> to read all files on the C drive, and a downstream demand is made for <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>FileIOPermission<ept id="p2">**</ept> to read files in C:\Temp, the assertion could affect the stack walk; however, if the demand was for <bpt id="p3">**</bpt>FileIOPermission<ept id="p3">**</ept> to write to the C drive, the assertion would have no effect.</source>

          <source>In this scenario, method A calls B, B calls C, C calls E, and E calls F. Method C asserts permission to read files on the C drive (permission P1), and method E demands permission to read .txt files on the C drive (permission P1A).</source>

        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When the demand in F is encountered at run time, a stack walk is performed to check the permissions of all callers of F, starting with E. E has been granted P1A permission, so the stack walk proceeds to examine the permissions of C, where C's assertion is discovered.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Because the demanded permission (P1A) is a subset of the asserted permission (P1), the stack walk stops and the security check automatically succeeds.</source>

        <trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>By asserting P1, method C ensures that its callers can access the resource protected by P1, even if the callers have not been granted permission to access that resource.</source>

        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If the class then performs an operation for which you know most of its callers will not have permission, and if you are willing to take the responsibility for letting these callers call your code, you can assert the permission by calling the <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Assert<ept id="p1">**</ept> method on a permission object that represents the operation the code is performing.</source>
