The example principles that are shown here can be applied to other types of structured text.  \n  \n### To create the source file  \n  \n1.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named scores.csv and save it in your project folder. Assume that the first column represents a student ID, and subsequent columns represent scores from four exams.  \n  \n    ```  \n    111, 97, 92, 81, 60  \n    112, 75, 84, 91, 39  \n    113, 88, 94, 65, 91  \n    114, 97, 89, 85, 82  \n    115, 35, 72, 91, 70  \n    116, 99, 86, 90, 94  \n    117, 93, 92, 80, 87  \n    118, 92, 90, 83, 78  \n    119, 68, 79, 88, 92  \n    120, 99, 82, 81, 79  \n    121, 96, 85, 91, 60  \n    122, 94, 92, 91, 91  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass SumColumns  \n{  \n    static void Main(string[] args)  \n    {  \n        string[] lines = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@\"../../../scores.csv\");  \n  \n        // Specifies the column to compute.  \n        int exam = 3;  \n  \n        // Spreadsheet format:  \n        // Student ID    Exam#1  Exam#2  Exam#3  Exam#4  \n        // 111,          97,     92,     81,     60  \n  \n        // Add one to exam to skip over the first column,  \n        // which holds the student ID.  \n        SingleColumn(lines, exam + 1);  \n        Console.WriteLine();  \n        MultiColumns(lines);  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit\");  \n        Console.ReadKey();  \n    }  \n  \n    static void SingleColumn(IEnumerable<string> strs, int examNum)  \n    {  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Single Column Query:\");  \n  \n        // Parameter examNum specifies the column to   \n        // run the calculations on.

Each array element represents a column. Finally, the text in each column is converted to its numeric representation. If your file is a tab-separated file, just update the argument in the `Split` method to `\\t`.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and `using` directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [LINQ and Strings (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-strings.md)   \n [LINQ and File Directories (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-file-directories.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,89],"content":"How to: Compute Column Values in a CSV Text File (LINQ) (C#) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Compute Column Values in a CSV Text File (LINQ) (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,77]}]},{"pos":[448,508],"content":"How to: Compute Column Values in a CSV Text File (LINQ) (C#)","linkify":"How to: Compute Column Values in a CSV Text File (LINQ) (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Compute Column Values in a CSV Text File (LINQ) (C#)","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to perform aggregate computations such as Sum, Average, Min, and Max on the columns of a .csv file.","pos":[509,631]},{"content":"The example principles that are shown here can be applied to other types of structured text.","pos":[632,724]},{"pos":[734,759],"content":"To create the source file","linkify":"To create the source file","nodes":[{"content":"To create the source file","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"Copy the following lines into a file that is named scores.csv and save it in your project folder.","pos":[769,866]},{"content":"Assume that the first column represents a student ID, and subsequent columns represent scores from four exams.","pos":[867,977]},{"pos":[1321,1328],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The query works by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.String.Split%2A&gt;</ph> method to convert each line of text into an array.","pos":[6084,6193],"source":"The query works by using the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method to convert each line of text into an array."},{"content":"Each array element represents a column.","pos":[6194,6233]},{"content":"Finally, the text in each column is converted to its numeric representation.","pos":[6234,6310]},{"content":"If your file is a tab-separated file, just update the argument in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Split`</ph> method to <ph id=\"ph2\">`\\t`</ph>.","pos":[6311,6404],"source":" If your file is a tab-separated file, just update the argument in the `Split` method to `\\t`."},{"pos":[6413,6431],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[6435,6612],"content":"Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.","source":"Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and `using` directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces."},{"pos":[6621,6629],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ and Strings (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-strings.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[6633,6729],"source":"[LINQ and Strings (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-strings.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>LINQ and File Directories (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-file-directories.md)</ept>","pos":[6732,6846],"source":" [LINQ and File Directories (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-file-directories.md)"}]}
