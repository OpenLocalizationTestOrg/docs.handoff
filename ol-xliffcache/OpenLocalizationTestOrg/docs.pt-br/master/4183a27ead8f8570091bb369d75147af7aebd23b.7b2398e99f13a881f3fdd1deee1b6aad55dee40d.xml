This technique can be useful if you have to combine data from two spreadsheets, or from a spreadsheet and from a file that has another format, into a new file. You can modify the example to work with any kind of structured text.  \n  \n## To create the data files\n  \n1.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named scores.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents spreadsheet data. Column 1 is the student's ID, and columns 2 through 5 are test scores.  \n  \n    ```  \n    111, 97, 92, 81, 60  \n    112, 75, 84, 91, 39  \n    113, 88, 94, 65, 91  \n    114, 97, 89, 85, 82  \n    115, 35, 72, 91, 70  \n    116, 99, 86, 90, 94  \n    117, 93, 92, 80, 87  \n    118, 92, 90, 83, 78  \n    119, 68, 79, 88, 92  \n    120, 99, 82, 81, 79  \n    121, 96, 85, 91, 60  \n    122, 94, 92, 91, 91  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Copy the following lines into a file that is named names.csv and save it to your project folder. The file represents a spreadsheet that contains the student's last name, first name, and student ID.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  \n    O'Donnell,Claire,112  \n    Mortensen,Sven,113  \n    Garcia,Cesar,114  \n    Garcia,Debra,115  \n    Fakhouri,Fadi,116  \n    Feng,Hanying,117  \n    Garcia,Hugo,118  \n    Tucker,Lance,119  \n    Adams,Terry,120  \n    Zabokritski,Eugene,121  \n    Tucker,Michael,122  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n\n```vb\nImports System.Collections.Generic\nImports System.Linq\n\nClass JoinStrings  \n  \n    Shared Sub Main()  \n  \n        ' Join content from spreadsheet files that contain  \n        ' related information. names.csv contains the student name  \n        ' plus an ID number. scores.csv contains the ID and a   \n        ' set of four test scores.
