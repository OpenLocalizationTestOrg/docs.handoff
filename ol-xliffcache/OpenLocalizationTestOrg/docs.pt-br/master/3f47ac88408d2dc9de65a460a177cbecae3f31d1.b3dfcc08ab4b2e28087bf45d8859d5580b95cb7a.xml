In other words, an <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider> provides a convenient way to use any tree of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xml-md.md)] nodes as a binding source.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the data is embedded directly as an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] *data island* within the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Resources%2A> section. An [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] data island must be wrapped in `<x:XData>` tags and always have a single root node, which is *Inventory* in this example.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The root node of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] data has an **xmlns** attribute that sets the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] namespace to an empty string. This is a requirement for applying XPath queries to a data island that is inline within the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page. In this inline case, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], and thus the data island, inherits the <xref:System.Windows> namespace. Because of this, you need to set the namespace blank to keep XPath queries from being qualified by the <xref:System.Windows> namespace, which would misdirect the queries.  \n  \n [!code-xml[XMLDataSource#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XmlDataSource/CS/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n As shown in this example, to create the same binding declaration in attribute syntax you must escape the special characters properly. For more information, see [XML Character Entities and XAML](../../../../docs/framework/xaml-services/xml-character-entities-and-xaml.md).  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> will show the following items when this example is run. These are the *Title*s of all of the elements under *Books* with either a *Stock* value of \"*out*\" or a *Number* value of 3 or greater than or equals to 8. Notice that no *CD* items are returned because the <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider.XPath%2A> value set on the <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider> indicates that only the *Books* elements should be exposed (essentially setting a filter).  \n  \n ![XPath Example](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/media/xpathexample.PNG \"XPathExample\")  \n  \n In this example, the book titles are displayed because the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.XPath%2A> of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> binding in the <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> is set to \"*Title*\". If you want to display the value of an attribute, such as the *ISBN*, you would set that <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.XPath%2A> value to \"`@ISBN`\".  \n  \n The **XPath** properties in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] are handled by the XmlNode.SelectNodes method. You can modify the **XPath** queries to get different results. Here are some examples for the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.XPath%2A> query on the bound <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> from the previous example:  \n  \n-   `XPath=\"Book[1]\"` will return the first book element (\"XML in Action\"). Note that **XPath** indexes are based on 1, not 0.  \n  \n-   `XPath=\"Book[@*]\"` will return all book elements with any attributes.  \n  \n-   `XPath=\"Book[last()-1]\"` will return the second to last book element (\"Introducing Microsoft .NET\").  \n  \n-   `XPath=\"*[position()>3]\"` will return all of the book elements except for the first 3.  \n  \n When you run an **XPath** query, it returns an <xref:System.Xml.XmlNode> or a list of XmlNodes. <xref:System.Xml.XmlNode> is a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] object, which means you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.Path%2A> property to bind to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] properties. Consider the previous example again. If the rest of the example stays the same and you change the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> binding to the following, you will see the names of the returned XmlNodes in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>. In this case, the name of all the returned nodes is \"*Book*\".  \n  \n [!code-xml[XmlDataSourceVariation#XmlNodePath](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XmlDataSourceVariation/CS/Page1.xaml#xmlnodepath)]  \n  \n In some applications, embedding the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] as a data island within the source of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page can be inconvenient because the exact content of the data must be known at compile time. Therefore, obtaining the data from an external [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] file is also supported, as in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-xml[XMLDataSource2#XmlFileExample](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XmlDataSource2/CS/Window1.xaml#xmlfileexample)]  \n  \n If the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] data resides in a remote [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] file, you would define access to the data by assigning an appropriate [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_url](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-url-md.md)] to the <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider.Source%2A> attribute as follows:  \n  \n```  \n<XmlDataProvider x:Key=\"BookData\" Source=\"http://MyUrl\" XPath=\"Books\"/>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider>   \n [Bind to XDocument, XElement, or LINQ for XML Query Results](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-bind-to-xdocument-xelement-or-linq-for-xml-query-results.md)   \n [Use the Master-Detail Pattern with Hierarchical XML Data](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-use-the-master-detail-pattern-with-hierarchical-xml-data.md)   \n [Binding Sources Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/binding-sources-overview.md)   \n [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md)   \n [How-to Topics](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-how-to-topics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,589],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind to XML Data Using an XMLDataProvider and XPath Queries | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
