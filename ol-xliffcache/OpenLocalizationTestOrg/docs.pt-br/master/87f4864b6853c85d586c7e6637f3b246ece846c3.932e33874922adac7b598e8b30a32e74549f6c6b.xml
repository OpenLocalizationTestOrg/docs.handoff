In the .NET Framework version 2.0, there is an <xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext> object that contains information about the currently executing thread, and flows it across asynchronous points within an application domain. The <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity> also flows as part of the information that flows across the asynchronous points, provided the impersonation was achieved using managed methods such as <xref:System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.Impersonate%2A> and not through other means such as platform invoke to native methods. This element is used to specify that the Windows identity does flow across asynchronous points, regardless of how the impersonation was achieved.  \n  \n You can alter this default behavior in two other ways:  \n  \n1.  In managed code on a per-thread basis.  \n  \n     You can suppress the flow on a per-thread basis by modifying the <xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext> and <xref:System.Security.SecurityContext> settings by using the <xref:System.Threading.ExecutionContext.SuppressFlow%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Security.SecurityContext.SuppressFlowWindowsIdentity%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, or <xref:System.Security.SecurityContext.SuppressFlow%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n2.  In the call to the unmanaged hosting interface to load the common language runtime (CLR).  \n  \n     If an unmanaged hosting interface (instead of a simple managed executable) is used to load the CLR, you can specify a special flag in the call to the [CorBindToRuntimeEx Function](../../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corbindtoruntimeex-function.md) function. To enable the compatibility mode for the entire process, set the `flags` parameter for [CorBindToRuntimeEx Function](../../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/corbindtoruntimeex-function.md) to `STARTUP_ALWAYSFLOW_IMPERSONATION`.  \n  \n## Configuration File  \n In a .NET Framework application, this element can be used only in the application configuration file.  \n  \n For an ASP.NET application, the impersonation flow can be configured in the aspnet.config file found in the \\<Windows Folder>\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\vx.x.xxxx directory.  \n  \n ASP.NET by default disables the impersonation flow in the aspnet.config file by using the following configuration settings:  \n  \n```  \n  \nconfiguration>  \n   <runtime>  \n      <legacyImpersonationPolicy enabled=\"true\"/>  \n      <alwaysFlowImpersonationPolicy enabled=\"false\"/>  \n   </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n  \n In ASP.NET, if you want to allow the flow of impersonation instead, you must explicitly use the following configuration settings:  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n   <runtime>  \n      <legacyImpersonationPolicy enabled=\"false\"/>  \n      <alwaysFlowImpersonationPolicy enabled=\"true\"/>  \n   </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to specify that the Windows identity flows across asynchronous points, even when the impersonation is achieved through means other than managed methods.  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n  <runtime>  \n    <alwaysFlowImpersonationPolicy enabled=\"true\"/>  \n  </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Runtime Settings Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/index.md)   \n [Configuration File
