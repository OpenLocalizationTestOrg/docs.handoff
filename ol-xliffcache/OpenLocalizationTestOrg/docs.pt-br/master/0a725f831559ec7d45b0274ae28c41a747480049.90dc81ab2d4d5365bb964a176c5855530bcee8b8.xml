The <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=fullName> namespace gives you many layout tools to accomplish this.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [AutoSize Property Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/autosize-property-overview.md)  \n Describes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AutoSize%2A> property and its role in layout.  \n  \n [Margin and Padding in Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/margin-and-padding-in-windows-forms-controls.md)  \n Describes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Margin%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Padding%2A> properties and their roles in layout.  \n  \n [How to: Align a Control to the Edges of Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-align-a-control-to-the-edges-of-forms.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to align your control to the edge of the form it occupies.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Border Around a Windows Forms Control Using Padding](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-border-around-a-windows-forms-control-using-padding.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Padding%2A> property to outline a control.  \n  \n [How to: Implement a Custom Layout Engine](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-implement-a-custom-layout-engine.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Layout.LayoutEngine> for arranging Windows Forms controls.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n
