This topic is based on the [AdventureWorks Sales](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb387147(v=vs.100)) conceptual model. The AdventureWorks Sales Model is used throughout the task-related topics in the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] documentation. This topic assumes that you have already configured the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] and defined the AdventureWorks Sales Model. For more information, see [How to: Manually Define the Model and Mapping Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399785(v=vs.100)). The procedures in this topic are also included in [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100)).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)] Wizard in a Visual Studio project, it automatically generates an .edmx file and configures the project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]. For more information, see [How to: Use the Entity Data Model Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738677(v=vs.100))\n\n## To define the Entity Framework connection string\n\n- Open the project's application configuration file (app.config) and add the following connection string:\n\n```xml\n<connectionStrings>\n    <add name=\"AdventureWorksEntities\" \n         connectionString=\"metadata=.\\AdventureWorks.csdl|.\\AdventureWorks.ssdl|.\\AdventureWorks.msl;\n         provider=System.Data.SqlClient;provider connection string='Data Source=localhost;\n         Initial Catalog=AdventureWorks;Integrated Security=True;Connection Timeout=60;\n         multipleactiveresultsets=true'\" providerName=\"System.Data.EntityClient\" />\n</connectionStrings>\n```\n\nIf your project does not have an application configuration file, you can add one by selecting **Add New Item** from the **Project** menu, selecting the **General** category, selecting **Application Configuration File**, and then clicking **Add**.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399182(v=vs.100))\n- [How to: Create a New .edmx File](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cc716703(v=vs.100))\n- [ADO.NET Entity Data Model  Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399249(v=vs.100))\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,120],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Define the Connection String\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 6027335d-4e26-420d-9151-6523289b1989","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define the Connection String","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"How to: Define the Connection String","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define the Connection String","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[127,163],"content":"How to: Define the Connection String","linkify":"How to: Define the Connection String","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define the Connection String","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"This topic shows how to define the connection string that is used when connecting to a conceptual model.","pos":[165,269]},{"content":"This topic is based on the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>AdventureWorks Sales<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb387147(v=vs.100))</ept> conceptual model.","pos":[270,426],"source":" This topic is based on the [AdventureWorks Sales](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb387147(v=vs.100)) conceptual model."},{"content":"The AdventureWorks Sales Model is used throughout the task-related topics in the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]</ph> documentation.","pos":[427,585],"source":" The AdventureWorks Sales Model is used throughout the task-related topics in the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] documentation."},{"content":"This topic assumes that you have already configured the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]</ph> and defined the AdventureWorks Sales Model.","pos":[586,748],"source":" This topic assumes that you have already configured the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] and defined the AdventureWorks Sales Model."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Manually Define the Model and Mapping Files<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399785(v=vs.100))</ept>.","pos":[749,918],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Manually Define the Model and Mapping Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb399785(v=vs.100))."},{"content":"The procedures in this topic are also included in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100))</ept>.","pos":[919,1115],"source":" The procedures in this topic are also included in [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/bb738546(v=vs.100))."},{"pos":[1119,1544],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIf you use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)] Wizard in a Visual Studio project, it automatically generates an .edmx file and configures the project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)].
