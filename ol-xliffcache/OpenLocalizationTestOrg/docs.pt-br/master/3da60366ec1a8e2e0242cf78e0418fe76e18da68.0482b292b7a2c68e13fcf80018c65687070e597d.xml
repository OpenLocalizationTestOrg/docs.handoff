The example input is a URI such as `http://www.contoso.com/`.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example creates a cache policy that allows the requested resource to be used from the cache if it has not been in the cache for longer than one day. The example displays a message that indicates whether the resource was used from the cache—for example, `\"The response was retrieved from the cache : False.\"`—and then displays the resource. A request can be fulfilled by any cache between the client and server.  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Net;  \nusing System.Net.Cache;  \nusing System.IO;  \n  \nnamespace Examples.System.Net.Cache  \n{  \n    public class CacheExample  \n    {     \n        public static void UseCacheForOneDay(Uri resource)  \n        {  \n            // Create a policy that allows items in the cache  \n            // to be used if they have been cached one day or less.  \n            HttpRequestCachePolicy requestPolicy =   \n                new HttpRequestCachePolicy (HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAge,  \n                TimeSpan.FromDays(1));  \n  \n            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create (resource);  \n            // Set the policy for this request only.  \n            request.CachePolicy = requestPolicy;  \n            HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();  \n            // Determine whether the response was retrieved from the cache.  \n            Console.WriteLine (\"The response was retrieved from the cache : {0}.\",  \n               response.IsFromCache);  \n            Stream s = response.GetResponseStream ();  \n            StreamReader reader = new StreamReader (s);  \n            // Display the requested resource.  \n            Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd());  \n            reader.Close ();  \n            s.Close();  \n            response.Close();  \n        }  \n        public static void Main(string[] args)  \n        {  \n            if (args == null || args.Length != 1)  \n            {  \n                Console.WriteLine (\"You must specify the URI to retrieve.\");  \n                return;  \n            }  \n            UseCacheForOneDay (new Uri(args[0]));  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.Net  \nImports System.Net.Cache  \nImports System.IO  \nNamespace Examples.System.Net.Cache  \n    Public Class CacheExample  \n        Public Shared Sub UseCacheForOneDay(ByVal resource As Uri)  \n            ' Create a policy that allows items in the cache  \n            ' to be used if they have been cached one day or less.  \n            Dim requestPolicy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n                  (HttpCacheAgeControl.MaxAge, TimeSpan.FromDays(1))  \n            Dim request As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(resource)  \n            ' Set the policy for this request only.  \n            request.CachePolicy = requestPolicy  \n            Dim response As HttpWebResponse = _  \n             CType(request.GetResponse(), HttpWebResponse)  \n            ' Determine whether the response was retrieved from the cache.  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The response was retrieved from the cache : {0}.\", _  \n                response.IsFromCache)  \n            Dim s As Stream = response.GetResponseStream()  \n            Dim reader As New StreamReader(s)  \n            ' Display the requested resource.  \n            Console.WriteLine(reader.ReadToEnd())  \n            reader.Close()  \n            s.Close()  \n            response.Close()  \n        End Sub  \n        Public Shared Sub Main(ByVal args() As String)  \n            If args Is Nothing OrElse args.Length <> 1 Then  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"You must specify the URI to retrieve.\")  \n                Return  \n            End If  \n            UseCacheForOneDay(New Uri(args(0)))  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \nEnd Namespace  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Cache Management for Network Applications](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-management-for-network-applications.md)\n- [Cache Policy](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/cache-policy.md)\n- [Location-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/location-based-cache-policies.md)\n- [Time-Based Cache Policies](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/time-based-cache-policies.md)\n- [\\<requestCaching> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/requestcaching-element-network-settings.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,207],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Set Cache Policy for a Request\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
