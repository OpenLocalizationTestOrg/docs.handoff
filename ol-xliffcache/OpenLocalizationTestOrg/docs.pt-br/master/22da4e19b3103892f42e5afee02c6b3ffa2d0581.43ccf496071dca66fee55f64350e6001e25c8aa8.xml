When creating your own application domains, the most important property is <xref:System.AppDomainSetup.ApplicationBase%2A>. The other **AppDomainSetup** properties are used mainly by runtime hosts to configure a particular application domain.  \n  \n The **ApplicationBase** property defines the root directory of the application. When the runtime needs to satisfy a type request, it probes for the assembly containing the type in the directory specified by the **ApplicationBase** property.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A new application domain inherits only the **ApplicationBase** property of the creator.  \n  \n The following example creates an instance of the **AppDomainSetup** class, uses this class to create a new application domain, writes the information to console, and then unloads the application domain.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[ADApplicationBase#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADApplicationBase/CPP/source2.cpp#2)]\n [!code-csharp[ADApplicationBase#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADApplicationBase/CS/source2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[ADApplicationBase#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADApplicationBase/VB/source2.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Programming with Application Domains](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bd36055b-56bd-43eb-b4d8-820c37172131)   \n [Using Application Domains](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,456],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Configure an Application Domain | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
