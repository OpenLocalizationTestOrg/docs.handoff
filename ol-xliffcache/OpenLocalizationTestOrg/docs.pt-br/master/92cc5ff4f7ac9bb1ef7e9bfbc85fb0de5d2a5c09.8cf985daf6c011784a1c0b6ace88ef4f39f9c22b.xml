XML serialization results in strongly typed classes with public properties and fields that are converted to a serial format (in this case, XML) for storage or transport.  \n  \n Because XML is an open standard, the XML stream can be processed by any application, as needed, regardless of platform. For example, XML Web services created using ASP.NET use the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class to create XML streams that pass data between XML Web service applications throughout the Internet or on intranets. Conversely, deserialization takes such an XML stream and reconstructs the object.  \n  \n XML serialization can also be used to serialize objects into XML streams that conform to the SOAP specification. SOAP is a protocol based on XML, designed specifically to transport procedure calls using XML.  \n  \n To serialize or deserialize objects, use the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> class. To create the classes to be serialized, use the XML Schema Definition tool.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Introducing XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization.md)  \n Provides a general definition of serialization, particularly XML serialization.  \n  \n [How to: Serialize an Object](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-serialize-an-object.md)  \n Provides step-by-step instructions for serializing an object.  \n  \n [How to: Deserialize an

encoded SOAP XML streams that conform to section 5 of the World Wide Web Consortium (www.w3.org) document titled \"Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 1.1.\"  \n  \n [How to: Override Encoded SOAP XML Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/how-to-override-encoded-soap-xml-serialization.md)  \n Describes the process for overriding XML serialization of objects as SOAP messages.  \n
