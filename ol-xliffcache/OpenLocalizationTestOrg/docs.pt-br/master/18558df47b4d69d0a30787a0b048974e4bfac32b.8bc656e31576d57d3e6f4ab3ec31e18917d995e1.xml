The [GetAvailableThreads](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostthreadpoolmanager-getavailablethreads-method.md) method gets the number of threads that are not currently processing work items. All requests above the returned value of the `pdwMaxWorkerThreads` parameter remain queued until threads become available.  \n  \n If the host does not provide an implementation of `GetMaxThreads`, it should return an HRESULT value of E_NOTIMPL.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:**
