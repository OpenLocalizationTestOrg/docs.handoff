Because the layout is performed both at design time and run time, it can change dynamically as the application environment changes. This gives the controls in the panel the ability to proportionally resize, so it can respond to changes such as the parent control resizing or text length changing due to localization.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [TableLayoutPanel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/tablelayoutpanel-control-overview.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control, which allows you to create a layout with rows and columns.  \n  \n [Best Practices for the TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/best-practices-for-the-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)  \n Outlines recommendations to help you get the most out of the layout features of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n [AutoSize Behavior in the TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/autosize-behavior-in-the-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)  \n Explains the ways in which the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control supports automatic sizing behavior.  \n  \n [How to: Anchor and Dock Child Controls in a TableLayoutPanel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-anchor-and-dock-child-controls-in-a-tablelayoutpanel-control.md)  \n Shows how to anchor and dock child controls in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n [How to: Design a Windows Forms Layout that Responds Well to Localization](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-design-a-windows-forms-layout-that-responds-well-to-localization.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to build a form that responds well to localization.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Resizable Windows Form for Data Entry](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-resizable-windows-form-for-data-entry.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to build a form that responds well to resizing.  \n  \n1.
