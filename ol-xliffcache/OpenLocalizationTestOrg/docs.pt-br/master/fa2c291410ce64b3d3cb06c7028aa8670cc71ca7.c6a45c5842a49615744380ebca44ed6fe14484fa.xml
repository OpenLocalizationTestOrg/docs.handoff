Rename the variable that is declared on the line that generated CS0136.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0136:  \n  \n```  \n// CS0136.cs  \nnamespace MyNamespace  \n{  \n   public class MyClass  \n   {  \n      public static void Main()  \n      {  \n         int i = 0;  \n         {  \n            char i = 'a';   // CS0136, hides int i  \n         }  \n         i++;  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n From the [C# Language Specification](../../csharp/language-reference/language-specification.md), Section 7.5.2.1:  \n  \n For each occurrence of a given identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator, within the local variable declaration space (ยง3.3) immediately enclosing that occurrence, every other occurrence of the same identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator must refer to the same entity. This rule ensures that the meaning of a name is always the same within a given block, switch block, for-, foreach- or using-statement, or anonymous function.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0136 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0136 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS0136","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0136","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0136","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"A local variable named 'var' cannot be declared in this scope because it would give a different meaning to 'var', which is already used in a 'parent or current/child' scope to denote something else","pos":[587,784]},{"content":"A variable declaration hides another declaration that would otherwise be in scope.","pos":[791,873]},{"content":"Rename the variable that is declared on the line that generated CS0136.","pos":[874,945]},{"pos":[954,961],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0136:","pos":[965,1003]},{"pos":[1283,1396],"content":"From the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Language Specification<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/language-specification.md)</ept>, Section 7.5.2.1:","source":"From the [C# Language Specification](../../csharp/language-reference/language-specification.md), Section 7.5.2.1:"},{"content":"For each occurrence of a given identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator, within the local variable declaration space (ยง3.3) immediately enclosing that occurrence, every other occurrence of the same identifier as a simple-name in an expression or declarator must refer to the same entity.","pos":[1403,1708]},{"content":"This rule ensures that the meaning of a name is always the same within a given block, switch block, for-, foreach- or using-statement, or anonymous function.","pos":[1709,1866]}]}
