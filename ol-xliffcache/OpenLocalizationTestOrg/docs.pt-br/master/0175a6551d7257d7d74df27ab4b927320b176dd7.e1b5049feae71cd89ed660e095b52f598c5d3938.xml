However, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.  \n  \n Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> controls are used to display text or images that cannot be edited by the user. They are used to identify objects on a form—to provide a description of what a certain control will do if clicked, for example, or to display information in response to a run-time event or process in your application. Because the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control cannot receive focus, it can also be used to create access keys for other controls.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Label Control Overview](label-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Create Access Keys with Windows Forms Label Controls](how-to-create-access-keys-with-windows-forms-label-controls.md)  \n Describes how to use a label to define an access key for another control.  \n  \n [How to: Size a Windows Forms Label Control to Fit Its Contents](how-to-size-a-windows-forms-label-control-to-fit-its-contents.md)  \n Explains adjusting the size of a label control for its caption.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,224],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Label Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Label control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"labels\"\n  - \"LinkLabel control [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 2028bbe3-ffe2-43e8-8ae3-dec759d2ecec","nodes":[{"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[231,260],"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Label Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[263,687],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripLabel> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> control.
