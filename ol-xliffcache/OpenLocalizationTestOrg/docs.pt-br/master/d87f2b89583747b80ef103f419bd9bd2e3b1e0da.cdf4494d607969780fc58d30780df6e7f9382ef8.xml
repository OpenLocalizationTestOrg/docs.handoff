This means that you can write stored procedures, triggers, user-defined types, user-defined functions, user-defined aggregates, and streaming table-valued functions, using any .NET Framework language, including Microsoft Visual Basic .NET and Microsoft Visual C#. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Server> namespace contains a set of new application programming interfaces (APIs) so that managed code can interact with the Microsoft SQL Server environment.  \n  \n This section describes features and behaviors that are specific to SQL Server common language runtime (CLR) integration and the SQL Server in-process specific extensions to ADO.NET.  \n  \n This section is meant to provide only enough information to get started programming with SQL Server CLR integration, and is not meant to be comprehensive. For more detailed information, see the version of SQL Server Books Online for the version of SQL Server you are using.  \n  \n **SQL Server Books Online**  \n  \n1.
