The Entity Data Model Tools in Visual Studio allow you to create an .[edmx file](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cc982042(v=vs.100)) from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes.  \n  \n Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can also create a model programmatically using Code First development. There are two different scenarios for Code First development. In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.  \n  \n For more information, see [Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016).  \n  \n You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. The EdmGen.exe generates the .csdl, .ssdl, and .msl files from an existing data source. You can also manually create the model and mapping content. For more information, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,104],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Modeling and Mapping\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: ec8a9515-3708-4cde-a688-4d8e6975f150","nodes":[{"content":"Modeling and Mapping","nodes":[{"pos":[0,20],"content":"Modeling and Mapping","nodes":[{"content":"Modeling and Mapping","pos":[0,20]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[111,131],"content":"Modeling and Mapping","linkify":"Modeling and Mapping","nodes":[{"content":"Modeling and Mapping","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"In the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)]</ph>, you can define the conceptual model, storage model, and the mapping between the two in the way that best suits your application.","pos":[132,331],"source":"In the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)], you can define the conceptual model, storage model, and the mapping between the two in the way that best suits your application."},{"content":"The Entity Data Model Tools in Visual Studio allow you to create an .<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>edmx file<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cc982042(v=vs.100))</ept> from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes.","pos":[332,607],"source":" The Entity Data Model Tools in Visual Studio allow you to create an .[edmx file](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/cc982042(v=vs.100)) from a database or a graphical model and then update that file when either the database or model changes."},{"content":"Starting with the Entity Framework 4.1 you can also create a model programmatically using Code First development.","pos":[614,727]},{"content":"There are two different scenarios for Code First development.","pos":[728,789]},{"content":"In both cases, the developer defines a model by coding .NET Framework class definitions, and then optionally specifies additional mapping or configuration by using Data Annotations or the fluent API.","pos":[790,989]},{"pos":[996,1112],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [Creating and Mapping a Conceptual Model](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=235016)."},{"content":"You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[1119,1249],"source":"You can also use the EDM Generator, which is included with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]."},{"content":"The EdmGen.exe generates the .csdl, .ssdl, and .msl files from an existing data source.","pos":[1250,1337]},{"content":"You can also manually create the model and mapping content.","pos":[1338,1397]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1398,1527],"source":" For more information, see [EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe.md)."}]}
