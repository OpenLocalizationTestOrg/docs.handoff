It is generated by Microsoft utilities such as uuidgen.exe and is guaranteed to be unique in space and time.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32500  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Determine the correct GUID or GUIDs necessary to identify the COM object.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that the GUID strings presented to the `COMClassAttribute` attribute block are copied correctly.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Guid>\n- [Attributes overview](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,249],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '<number>' is not correct\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32500\"\n  - \"bc32500\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32500\"\nms.assetid: 6fa34c55-368e-4d7d-b488-07a3fffe045f","nodes":[{"content":"'<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '<number>' is not correct","nodes":[{"pos":[0,88],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;attribute&gt;</ph>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;number&gt;</ph>' is not correct","source":"'<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '<number>' is not correct"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[256,346],"content":"'\\<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '\\<number>' is not correct","linkify":"'\\<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '\\<number>' is not correct","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>attribute&gt;' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>number&gt;' is not correct","pos":[0,90],"source":"'\\<attribute>' cannot be applied because the format of the GUID '\\<number>' is not correct"}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`COMClassAttribute`</ph> attribute block specifies a globally unique identifier (GUID) that does not conform to the proper format for a GUID.","pos":[347,485],"source":"A `COMClassAttribute` attribute block specifies a globally unique identifier (GUID) that does not conform to the proper format for a GUID."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`COMClassAttribute`</ph> uses GUIDs to uniquely identify the class, the interface, and the creation event.","pos":[486,587],"source":"`COMClassAttribute` uses GUIDs to uniquely identify the class, the interface, and the creation event."},{"content":"A GUID consists of 16 bytes, of which the first eight are numeric and the last eight are binary.","pos":[594,690]},{"content":"It is generated by Microsoft utilities such as uuidgen.exe and is guaranteed to be unique in space and time.","pos":[691,799]},{"pos":[806,827],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32500","source":"**Error ID:** BC32500"},{"pos":[836,857],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Determine the correct GUID or GUIDs necessary to identify the COM object.","pos":[867,940]},{"pos":[950,1053],"content":"Ensure that the GUID strings presented to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`COMClassAttribute`</ph> attribute block are copied correctly.","source":"Ensure that the GUID strings presented to the `COMClassAttribute` attribute block are copied correctly."},{"pos":[1062,1070],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1095,1186],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Attributes overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Attributes overview](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index.md)"}]}
