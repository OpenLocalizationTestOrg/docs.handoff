You can disable gamma correction by setting the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush.GammaCorrection%2A> property to `false`. Gamma correction is disabled by default.  \n  \n## Example  \n The example creates a linear gradient brush and uses that brush to fill two rectangles. The first rectangle is filled without gamma correction, and the second rectangle is filled with gamma correction.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the two filled rectangles. The top rectangle, which does not have gamma correction, appears dark in the middle. The bottom rectangle, which has gamma correction, appears to have more uniform intensity.  \n  \n ![Gradient](./media/gammagradient1.png \"gammagradient1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingaGradientBrush#31](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingaGradientBrush/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingaGradientBrush#31](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingaGradientBrush/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush>\n- [Using a Gradient Brush to Fill Shapes](using-a-gradient-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,291],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"gradient brushes [Windows Forms], gamma correction\"\n  - \"gradients [Windows Forms], gamma correction\"\nms.assetid: da4690e7-5fac-4fd2-b3f0-5cb35c165b92","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[298,342],"content":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","linkify":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Apply Gamma Correction to a Gradient","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"You can enable gamma correction for a linear gradient brush by setting the brush's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush.GammaCorrection%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`true`</ph>.","pos":[343,516],"source":"You can enable gamma correction for a linear gradient brush by setting the brush's <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush.GammaCorrection%2A> property to `true`."},{"content":"You can disable gamma correction by setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush.GammaCorrection%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","pos":[517,656],"source":" You can disable gamma correction by setting the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush.GammaCorrection%2A> property to `false`."},{"content":"Gamma correction is disabled by default.","pos":[657,697]},{"pos":[706,713],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The example creates a linear gradient brush and uses that brush to fill two rectangles.","pos":[717,804]},{"content":"The first rectangle is filled without gamma correction, and the second rectangle is filled with gamma correction.","pos":[805,918]},{"content":"The following illustration shows the two filled rectangles.","pos":[925,984]},{"content":"The top rectangle, which does not have gamma correction, appears dark in the middle.","pos":[985,1069]},{"content":"The bottom rectangle, which has gamma correction, appears to have more uniform intensity.","pos":[1070,1159]},{"pos":[1166,1222],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Gradient<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/gammagradient1.png \"</bpt>gammagradient1<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Gradient](./media/gammagradient1.png \"gammagradient1\")"},{"pos":[1545,1563],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1567,1777],"content":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`e`</ph>, which is a parameter of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint&gt;</ph> event handler.","source":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler."},{"pos":[1786,1794],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1852,1933],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using a Gradient Brush to Fill Shapes<ept id=\"p1\">](using-a-gradient-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)</ept>","source":"[Using a Gradient Brush to Fill Shapes](using-a-gradient-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)"}]}
