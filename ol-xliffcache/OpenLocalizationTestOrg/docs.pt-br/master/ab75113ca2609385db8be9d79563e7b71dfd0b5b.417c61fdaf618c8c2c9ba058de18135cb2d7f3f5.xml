Such cross-domain joins can yield undefined results because of different ways in which join operations might be defined for database queries and other types of sources. Additionally, there is a risk that such an operation could cause an out-of-memory exception if the amount of data in the database is large enough. To join data from a database to in-memory data, first call `ToList` or `ToArray` on the database query, and then perform the join on the returned collection.  \n  \n### To create the data file  \n  \n-   Copy the names.csv and scores.csv files into your project folder, as described in [How to: Join Content from Dissimilar Files (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-join-content-from-dissimilar-files-linq.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use a named type `Student` to store merged data from two in-memory collections of strings that simulate spreadsheet data in .csv format. The first collection of strings represents the student names and IDs, and the second collection represents the student ID (in the first column) and four exam scores. The ID is used as the foreign key.  \n  \n```vb  \nClass Student  \n    Public FirstName As String  \n    Public LastName As String  \n    Public ID As Integer  \n    Public ExamScores As List(Of Integer)  \nEnd Class  \n  \nClass PopulateCollection  \n  \n    Shared Sub Main()  \n  \n        ' Merge content from spreadsheets into a list of Student objects.  \n  \n        ' These data files are defined in How to: Join Content from   \n        ' Dissimilar Files (LINQ).  \n  \n        ' Each line of names.csv consists of a last name, a first name, and an  \n        ' ID number, separated by commas. For example, Omelchenko,Svetlana,111  \n        Dim names As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(\"../../../names.csv\")  \n  \n        ' Each line of scores.csv consists of an ID number and four test   \n        ' scores, separated by commas. For example, 111, 97, 92, 81, 60  \n        Dim scores As String() = System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(\"../../../scores.csv\")  \n  \n        ' The following query merges the content of two dissimilar spreadsheets   \n        ' based on common ID values.  \n        ' Multiple From clauses are used instead of a Join clause  \n        ' in order to store the results of scoreLine.Split.  \n        ' Note the dynamic creation of a list of integers for the  \n        ' ExamScores member. We skip the first item in the split string   \n        ' because it is the student ID, not an exam score.  \n        Dim queryNamesScores = From nameLine In names  \n                          Let splitName = nameLine.Split(New Char() {\",\"})  \n                          From scoreLine In scores  \n                          Let splitScoreLine = scoreLine.Split(New Char() {\",\"})  \n                          Where splitName(2) = splitScoreLine(0)  \n                          Select New Student() With {  \n                               .FirstName = splitName(0), .LastName = splitName(1), .ID = splitName(2),  \n                               .ExamScores = (From scoreAsText In splitScoreLine Skip 1  \n                                             Select Convert.ToInt32(scoreAsText)).ToList()}  \n  \n        ' Optional. Store the query results for faster access in future  \n        ' queries. This could be useful with very large data files.  \n        Dim students As List(Of Student) = queryNamesScores.ToList()  \n  \n        ' Display each student's name and exam score average.  \n        For Each s In students  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"The average score of \" & s.FirstName & \" \" &  \n                              s.LastName & \" is \" & s.ExamScores.Average())  \n        Next  \n  \n        ' Keep console window open in debug mode.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to exit.\")  \n        Console.ReadKey()  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n  \n' Output:   \n' The average score of Omelchenko Svetlana is 82.5  \n' The average score of O'Donnell Claire is 72.25  \n' The average score of Mortensen Sven is 84.5  \n' The average score of Garcia Cesar is 88.25  \n' The average score of Garcia Debra is 67  \n' The average score of Fakhouri Fadi is 92.25  \n' The average score of Feng Hanying is 88  \n' The average score of Garcia Hugo is 85.75  \n' The average score of Tucker Lance is 81.75  \n' The average score of Adams Terry is 85.25  \n' The average score of Zabokritski Eugene is 83  \n' The average score of Tucker Michael is 92  \n```  \n  \n In the [Select Clause](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/select-clause.md) clause, an object initializer is used to instantiate each new `Student` object by using the data from the two sources.  \n  \n If you do not have to store the results of a query, anonymous types can be more convenient than named types. Named types are required if you pass the query results outside the method in which the query is executed. The following example performs the same task as the previous example, but uses anonymous types instead of named types:  \n  \n```vb  \n' Merge the data by using an anonymous type.   \n' Note the dynamic creation of a list of integers for the  \n' ExamScores member. We skip 1 because the first string  \n' in the array is the student ID, not an exam score.  \nDim queryNamesScores2 =  \n    From nameLine In names  \n    Let splitName = nameLine.Split(New Char() {\",\"})  \n    From scoreLine In scores  \n    Let splitScoreLine = scoreLine.Split(New Char() {\",\"})  \n    Where splitName(2) = splitScoreLine(0)  \n    Select New With  \n           {.Last = splitName(0),  \n            .First = splitName(1),  \n            .ExamScores = (From scoreAsText In splitScoreLine Skip 1  \n                           Select Convert.ToInt32(scoreAsText)).ToList()}  \n  \n' Display each student's name and exam score average.  \nFor Each s In queryNamesScores2  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"The average score of \" & s.First & \" \" &  \n                      s.Last & \" is \" & s.ExamScores.Average())  \nNext  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a `Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [LINQ and Strings (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-strings.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,108],"content":"How to: Populate Object Collections from Multiple Sources (LINQ) (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Populate Object Collections from Multiple Sources (LINQ) (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,96]}]},{"pos":[489,568],"content":"How to: Populate Object Collections from Multiple Sources (LINQ) (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Populate Object Collections from Multiple Sources (LINQ) (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Populate Object Collections from Multiple Sources (LINQ) (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to merge data from different sources into a sequence of new types.","pos":[569,658]},{"pos":[666,1250],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Do not try to join in-memory data or data in the file system with data that is still in a database.
