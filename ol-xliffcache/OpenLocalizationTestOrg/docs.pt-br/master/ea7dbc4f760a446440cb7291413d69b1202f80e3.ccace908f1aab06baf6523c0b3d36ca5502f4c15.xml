The code that [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] generates defines signatures as one part of a partial method. If you want to implement the method, you can add your own partial method. If you do not add your own implementation, the compiler discards the partial methods signature and calls the default methods in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you are using Visual Studio, you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to add validation and other customizations to entity classes.  \n  \n For example, the default mapping for the `Customer` class in the Northwind sample database includes the following partial method:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqOverrideDefault#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqOverrideDefault/cs/northwind.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqOverrideDefault#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqOverrideDefault/vb/northwind.vb#2)]  \n  \n You can implement your own method by adding code such as the following to your own partial `Customer` class:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqOverrideDefault#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqOverrideDefault/cs/Program.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqOverrideDefault#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqOverrideDefault/vb/Module1.vb#3)]  \n  \n This approach is typically used in [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] to override default methods for `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, and to validate properties during object life-cycle events.  \n  \n For more information, see [Partial Methods](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md) (Visual Basic) or [partial (Method) (C# Reference)](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/partial-method.md) (C#).  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n### Description  \n The following example shows `ExampleClass` first as it might be defined by a code-generating tool such as SQLMetal, and then how you might implement only one of the two methods.  \n  \n### Code  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqSubmittingChanges#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSubmittingChanges/cs/Program.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqSubmittingChanges#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqSubmittingChanges/vb/Module1.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n### Description  \n The following example uses the relationship between `Shipper` and `Order` entities. Note among the methods the partial methods, `InsertShipper` and `DeleteShipper`. These methods override the default partial methods supplied by [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] mapping.  \n  \n### Code  \n
