[Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)  \n Demonstrates hosting [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services.  \n  \n [Service Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-interoperability.md)  \n Demonstrates interaction between [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and other service technologies.  \n  \n [Behaviors](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/behaviors.md)  \n Demonstrates [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service behaviors.  \n  \n [Service Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-security.md)  \n Demonstrates [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service security.  \n  \n [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement and configure a typical service and client using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [Usage of Standard Endoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/usage-of-standard-endpoints.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use standard endpoints in service configuration files.  \n  \n [Hierarchical Configuration Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/hierarchical-configuration-model.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a hierarchy of configuration files for services.  \n  \n [Extended Protection Policy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/extended-protection-policy.md)  \n Demonstrates Extended Protection, a security initiative for protecting against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  \n  \n [Configuration Channel Factory](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/configuration-channel-factory.md)  \n Demonstrates the usage of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ConfigurationChannelFactory%601>.  \n  \n [Addressing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/addressing.md)  \n Demonstrates various aspects and features of endpoint addresses.  \n  \n [Imperative](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/imperative.md)  \n Demonstrates how to define a <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> for a service using code, instead of defining the `wsHttpBinding` binding in configuration.  \n  \n [Multiple Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-contracts.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement more than one contract on a service and how to configure endpoints for communicating with each of the implemented contracts.  \n  \n [Multiple Endpoints](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-endpoints.md)  \n Demonstrates how to configure multiple endpoints on a service and how to communicate with each endpoint from a client.  \n  \n [Multiple Endpoints at a Single ListenUri](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/multiple-endpoints-at-a-single-listenuri.md)  \n Demonstrates a service that hosts multiple endpoints at a single `ListenUri`.  \n  \n [OperationContextScope](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/operationcontextscope.md)  \n Demonstrates how to send extra information on a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] call using headers.  \n  \n [Service Description](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-description.md)  \n Demonstrates how a service can retrieve its service description information at runtime.  \n  \n [ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/concurrencymode-reentrant.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the Reentrant concurrency mode on a service implementation.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,38],"content":"Services2 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Services2 | Microsoft
