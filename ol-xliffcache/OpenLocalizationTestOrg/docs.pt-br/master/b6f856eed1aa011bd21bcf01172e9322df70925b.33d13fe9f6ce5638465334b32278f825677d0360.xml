Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/converting-a-nettcpbinding-application-to-a-peer-channel-application.md)  \n Describes hot to convert a NetTcpBinding Application to a Peer Channel Application.  \n  \n [Limiting Message Distribution](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/limiting-message-distribution.md)  \n Discusses using Hop Count, a Message Propagation Filter, a local filter, or a direct connection to control how messages are forwarded throughout the mesh, and provides general guidelines for choosing an approach.  \n  \n [Adding Online and Offline Status](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/adding-online-and-offline-status.md)  \n Describes how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.IOnlineStatus> interface to monitor specific details
