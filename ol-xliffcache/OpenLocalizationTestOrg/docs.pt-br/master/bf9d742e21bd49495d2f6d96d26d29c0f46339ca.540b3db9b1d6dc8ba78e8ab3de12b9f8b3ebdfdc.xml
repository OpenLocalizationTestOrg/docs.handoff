Define a custom binding for the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n     To specify that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing specification is used for message encoding, a custom binding must be created.  \n  \n    1.  Add a child [\\<customBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/custombinding.md) to the [\\<bindings>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md) of the service's configuration file.  \n  \n    2.  Specify a name for the binding, by adding a [\\<binding>](../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md) to the [\\<customBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/custombinding.md) and setting the `name` attribute.  \n  \n    3.  Specify an authentication mode and the version of the WS-Security specifications that are used to secure messages that are compatible with WSE 3.0, by adding a child [\\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md) to the [\\<binding>](../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md).  \n  \n         To set the authentication mode, set the `authenicationMode` attribute of the [\\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md). An authentication mode is roughly equivalent to a turnkey security assertion in WSE 3.0. The following table maps authentication modes in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to turnkey security assertions in WSE 3.0.  \n  \n        |WCF Authentication Mode|WSE 3.0 turnkey security assertion|  \n        |-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`anonymousForCertificateSecurity`|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`kerberosSecurity`|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`mutualCertificate10Security`*|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`mutualCertificate11Security`*|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`usernameOverTransportSecurity`|  \n        |<xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode>|`usernameForCertificateSecurity`|  \n  \n         \\* One of the primary differences between the `mutualCertificate10Security` and `mutualCertificate11Security` turnkey security assertions is the version of the WS-Security specification that WSE uses to secure the SOAP messages. For `mutualCertificate10Security`, WS-Security 1.0 is used, whereas WS-Security 1.1 is used for `mutualCertificate11Security`. For [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], the version of the WS-Security specification is specified in the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute of the [\\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md).  \n  \n         To set the version of the WS-Security specification that is used to secure SOAP messages, set the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute of the [\\<security>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/security-of-custombinding.md). To interoperate with WSE 3.0, set the value of the `messageSecurityVersion` attribute to <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageSecurityVersion.WSSecurity11WSTrustFebruary2005WSSecureConversationFebruary2005WSSecurityPolicy11BasicSecurityProfile10%2A>.  \n  \n    4.  Specify that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing specification is used by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] by adding a [\\<textMessageEncoding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/textmessageencoding.md) and set the `messageVersion` to its value to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageVersion.Soap11WSAddressingAugust2004%2A>.  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  When you are using SOAP 1.2, set the `messageVersion` attribute to <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.MessageVersion.Soap12WSAddressingAugust2004%2A>.  \n  \n2.  Specify that the service uses the custom binding.  \n  \n    1.  Set the `binding` attribute of the [\\<endpoint>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element to `customBinding`.  \n  \n    2.  Set the `bindingConfiguration` attribute of the [\\<endpoint>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/endpoint-element.md) element to the value specified in the `name` attribute of the [\\<binding>](../../../../docs/framework/misc/binding.md) for the custom binding.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example specifies that the `Service.HelloWorldService` uses a custom binding to interoperate with WSE 3.0 clients. The custom binding specifies that the August 2004 version of the WS-Addressing and the WS-Security 1.1 set of specifications are used to encode the exchanged messages. The messages are secured using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.AuthenticationMode> authentication mode.  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <services>  \n
