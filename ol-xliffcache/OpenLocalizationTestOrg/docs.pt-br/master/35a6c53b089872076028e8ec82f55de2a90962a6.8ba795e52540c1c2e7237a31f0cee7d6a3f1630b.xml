Other namespaces, such as <xref:System>, also provide new generic interfaces such as <xref:System.IComparable%601>. These classes and interfaces are more efficient and type-safe than the non-generic collection classes provided in earlier releases of the .NET Framework. Before designing and implementing your own custom collection classes, consider whether you can use or derive a class from one of the classes provided in the .NET Framework class library.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [When to Use Generic Collections](../../../standard/collections/when-to-use-generic-collections.md)   \n [Collections and Data Structures](../../../standard/collections/index.md)   \n [Introduction to Generics](../../../csharp/programming-guide/generics/introduction-to-generics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,96],"content":"Generics in the .NET Framework Class Library (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Generics in the .NET Framework Class Library (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,84]}]},{"pos":[599,666],"content":"Generics in the .NET Framework Class Library (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"Generics in the .NET Framework Class Library (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"Generics in the .NET Framework Class Library (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Version 2.0 of the .NET Framework class library provides a new namespace, <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.Generic&gt;</ph>, which includes several ready-to-use generic collection classes and associated interfaces.","pos":[667,865],"source":"Version 2.0 of the .NET Framework class library provides a new namespace, <xref:System.Collections.Generic>, which includes several ready-to-use generic collection classes and associated interfaces."},{"content":"Other namespaces, such as <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System&gt;</ph>, also provide new generic interfaces such as <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IComparable%601&gt;</ph>.","pos":[866,981],"source":" Other namespaces, such as <xref:System>, also provide new generic interfaces such as <xref:System.IComparable%601>."},{"content":"These classes and interfaces are more efficient and type-safe than the non-generic collection classes provided in earlier releases of the .NET Framework.","pos":[982,1135]},{"content":"Before designing and implementing your own custom collection classes, consider whether you can use or derive a class from one of the classes provided in the .NET Framework class library.","pos":[1136,1322]},{"pos":[1331,1339],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1343,1410],"source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>When to Use Generic Collections<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../standard/collections/when-to-use-generic-collections.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1413,1514],"source":" [When to Use Generic Collections](../../../standard/collections/when-to-use-generic-collections.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Collections and Data Structures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../standard/collections/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1517,1592],"source":" [Collections and Data Structures](../../../standard/collections/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Introduction to Generics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/generics/introduction-to-generics.md)</ept>","pos":[1595,1694],"source":" [Introduction to Generics](../../../csharp/programming-guide/generics/introduction-to-generics.md)"}]}
