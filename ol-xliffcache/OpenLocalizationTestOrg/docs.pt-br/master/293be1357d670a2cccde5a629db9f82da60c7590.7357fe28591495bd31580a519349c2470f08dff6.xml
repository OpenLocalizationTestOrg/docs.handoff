Workflows can use a combination of exception handlers, transactions, cancellation, and compensation to handle and recover gracefully from error conditions.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Exceptions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/exceptions.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TryCatch> activity to handle exceptions in a workflow.  \n  \n [Transactions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-transactions.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity to use transactions in a workflow.  \n  \n [Compensation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/compensation.md)  \n Describes compensation in workflows and demonstrates how to use compensation activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CompensableActivity>, <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Compensate>, and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Confirm>.  \n  \n [Cancellation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/modeling-cancellation-behavior-in-workflows.md)  \n Describes how to perform cancellation handling in workflows using built-in activities as well as custom activities.  \n  \n [Debugging Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/debugging-workflows.md)  \n Describes how to debug workflows.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,71],"content":"Exceptions, Transactions, and Compensation | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Exceptions, Transactions, and
