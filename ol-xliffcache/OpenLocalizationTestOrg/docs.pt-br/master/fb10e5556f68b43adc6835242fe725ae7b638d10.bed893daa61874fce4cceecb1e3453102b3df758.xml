Drag-and-Drop Operations and Clipboard Support\nYou can enable user drag-and-drop operations within a Windows-based application by handling a series of events, most notably the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragLeave>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DragDrop> events.  \n  \n You can also implement user cut/copy/paste support and user data transfer to the Clipboard within your Windows-based applications by using simple method calls.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Walkthrough: Performing a Drag-and-Drop Operation in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-performing-a-drag-and-drop-operation-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains how to start a drag-and-drop operation.  \n  \n [How to: Perform Drag-and-Drop Operations Between Applications](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-perform-drag-and-drop-operations-between-applications.md)  \n Illustrates how to accomplish drag-and-drop operations across applications.  \n  \n [How to: Add Data to the Clipboard](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-add-data-to-the-clipboard.md)  \n Describes a way to programmatically insert information on the Clipboard.  \n  \n [How to: Retrieve Data from the Clipboard](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-retrieve-data-from-the-clipboard.md)  \n Describes how to access the data stored on the Clipboard.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Drag-and-Drop Functionality in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/drag-and-drop-functionality-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes the methods, events, and classes used to implement drag-and-drop behavior.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.QueryContinueDrag>  \n Describes the intricacies of the event that asks permission to continue the drag operation.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoDragDrop%2A>  \n Describes the intricacies of the method that is central to beginning a drag operation.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard>  \n Also see
