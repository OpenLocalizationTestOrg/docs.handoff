However, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> does not provide a way to disable the appearance of the button displayed by the cell.  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates how to customize the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell> class to display buttons that can appear disabled. The example defines a new cell type, `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell`, that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell>. This cell type provides a new `Enabled` property that can be set to `false` to draw a disabled button in the cell. The example also defines a new column type, `DataGridViewDisableButtonColumn`, that displays `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell` objects. To demonstrate this new cell and column type, the current value of each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell> in the parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> determines whether the `Enabled` property of the `DataGridViewDisableButtonCell` in the same row is `true` or `false`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When you derive from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> and add new properties to the derived class, be sure to override the `Clone` method to copy the new properties during cloning operations. You should also call the base class's `Clone` method so that the properties of the base class are copied to the new cell or column.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DisabledButtons#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DisabledButtons/CS/form1.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DisabledButtons#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DisabledButtons/VB/form1.vb#0)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, System.Windows.Forms and System.Windows.Forms.VisualStyles assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
