The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> specifies how new animations interact with any existing ones that are already applied to a property.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates two buttons that enlarge when the mouse cursor moves over them and become smaller when the cursor moves away. If you mouse over a button and then quickly remove the cursor, the second animation will be applied before the first one is finished. It is when two animations overlap like this that you can see the difference between the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A> values of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace>. A value of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose> combines the overlapping animations causing a smoother transition between animations while a value of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace> causes the new animation to immediately replace the earlier overlapping animation.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#HandoffBehaviorWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/HandoffBehaviorExample.xaml#handoffbehaviorwholepage)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A>\n- [Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)\n- [Animation and Timing How-to Topics](animation-and-timing-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,276],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Storyboards [WPF], handoff behavior between animations\"\n  - \"animation [WPF], handoff behavior between\"\nms.assetid: 97bd6842-929b-49d9-813e-46553ae46472","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[283,344],"content":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","linkify":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Specify HandoffBehavior Between Storyboard Animations","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to specify handoff behavior between storyboard animations.","pos":[345,426]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A&gt;</ph> property of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard&gt;</ph> specifies how new animations interact with any existing ones that are already applied to a property.","pos":[427,670],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A> property of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard> specifies how new animations interact with any existing ones that are already applied to a property."},{"pos":[679,686],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates two buttons that enlarge when the mouse cursor moves over them and become smaller when the cursor moves away.","pos":[690,829]},{"content":"If you mouse over a button and then quickly remove the cursor, the second animation will be applied before the first one is finished.","pos":[830,963]},{"content":"It is when two animations overlap like this that you can see the difference between the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A&gt;</ph> values of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace&gt;</ph>.","pos":[964,1274],"source":" It is when two animations overlap like this that you can see the difference between the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.BeginStoryboard.HandoffBehavior%2A> values of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace>."},{"content":"A value of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose&gt;</ph> combines the overlapping animations causing a smoother transition between animations while a value of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace&gt;</ph> causes the new animation to immediately replace the earlier overlapping animation.","pos":[1275,1605],"source":" A value of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.Compose> combines the overlapping animations causing a smoother transition between animations while a value of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.HandoffBehavior.SnapshotAndReplace> causes the new animation to immediately replace the earlier overlapping animation."},{"pos":[1804,1812],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1947,1990],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animation Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](animation-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)"},{"pos":[1993,2068],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animation and Timing How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](animation-and-timing-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[Animation and Timing How-to Topics](animation-and-timing-how-to-topics.md)"}]}
