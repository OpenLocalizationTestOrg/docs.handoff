{"content":"---\ntitle: Introduction to C# - become familiar with the development tools\ndescription: This article provides a basic introduction to the tools you'll use to develop C# and .NET Applications on your machine.\nms.date: 10/23/2018\n---\n# Become familiar with the .NET development tools\n\nThe first step in running a tutorial on your machine is to set up a development environment.\nThe .NET topic [Get Started in 10 minutes](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) has instructions for setting\nup your local development environment on Mac, PC or Linux.\n\nAlternatively, you can install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\n## Basic application development flow\n\nYou'll create applications using the [`dotnet new`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-new.md) command. This command\ngenerates the files and assets necessary for your application. The introduction to C# tutorials all use the `console` application type. Once you've got the basics, you can expand to other application types.\n\nThe other commands you'll use are [`dotnet build`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-build.md) to build the executable,\nand [`dotnet run`](../../../core/tools/dotnet-run.md) to run the executable.\n\n## Pick your tutorial\n\nYou can start with any of the following tutorials:\n\n## [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md)\n\nIn the [Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) tutorial, you'll learn\nhow computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different\nnumeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding and how to perform\nmathematical calculations using C#.\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) lesson.\n\n## [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md)\n\nThe [Branches and loops](branches-and-loops-local.md) tutorial teaches the basics of selecting\ndifferent paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the\nbasics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose\ndifferent actions.\n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the [Hello world](hello-world.yml) and\n[Numbers in C#](numbers-in-csharp-local.md) lessons.\n\n## [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md)\n\nThe [List collection](arrays-and-collections.md) lesson gives you\na tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists. \n\nThis tutorial assumes that you have finished the lessons listed above.\n\n## [Introduction to classes](introduction-to-classes.md)\n\nThis final introduction to C# tutorial is only available to run on your machine, using your own local development environment and .NET Core.\nYou'll build a console application and see the basic object-oriented features that are part of the C# language.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,227],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Introduction to C# - become familiar with the development
