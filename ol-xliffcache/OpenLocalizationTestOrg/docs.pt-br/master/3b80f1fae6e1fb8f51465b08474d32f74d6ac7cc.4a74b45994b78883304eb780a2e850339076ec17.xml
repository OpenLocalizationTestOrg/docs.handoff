A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed.  \n  \n Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code. A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In order to perform a garbage collection, the runtime must suspend all the threads except the thread performing the collection. Each thread must be brought to a safe point before it can be suspended.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Threading.Thread>   \n <xref:System.GC>   \n [Threading](../../../docs/standard/threading/index.md)   \n [Automatic Memory Management](../../../docs/standard/automatic-memory-management.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,80],"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[568,619],"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","linkify":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","nodes":[{"content":"Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"When you call <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> on a thread, the system notes that a thread suspension has been requested and allows the thread to execute until it has reached a safe point before actually suspending the thread.","pos":[620,880],"source":"When you call <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Suspend%2A?displayProperty=fullName> on a thread, the system notes that a thread suspension has been requested and allows the thread to execute until it has reached a safe point before actually suspending the thread."},{"content":"A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed.","pos":[881,980]},{"content":"Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code.","pos":[987,1117]},{"content":"A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.","pos":[1118,1279]},{"pos":[1287,1497],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In order to perform a garbage collection, the runtime must suspend all the threads except the thread performing the collection.
