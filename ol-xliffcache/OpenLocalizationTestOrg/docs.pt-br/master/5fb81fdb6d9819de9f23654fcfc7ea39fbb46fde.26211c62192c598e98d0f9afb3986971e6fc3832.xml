The sample uses simulated *social networks*. A social network consists of a `Person` class that contains a list of friends in which each friend is an instance of the `Person` class, with its own list of friends. This creates a graph of objects. The service exposes operations on these social networks.  \n  \n In this sample, the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n## Service  \n The `Person` class has the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> attribute applied, with the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute.IsReference%2A> field set to `true` to declare it as a reference type. All properties have the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute applied.  \n  \n```  \n[DataContract(IsReference=true)]  \npublic class Person  \n{  \n    string name;  \n    string location;  \n    string gender;  \n    int age;  \n    List<Person> friends;  \n    [DataMember()]  \n    public string Name  \n    {  \n        get { return name; }  \n        set { name = value; }  \n    }  \n    [DataMember()]  \n    public string Location  \n    {  \n        get { return location; }  \n        set { location = value; }  \n    }  \n    [DataMember()]  \n    public string Gender  \n    {  \n        get { return gender; }  \n        set { gender = value; }  \n    }  \n…  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The `GetPeopleInNetwork` operation takes a parameter of type `Person` and returns all the people in the network; that is, all the people in the `friends` list, the friend's friends, and so on, without duplicates.  \n  \n```  \npublic List<Person> GetPeopleInNetwork(Person p)  \n{  \n    List<Person> people = new List<Person>();  \n    ListPeopleInNetwork(p, people);  \n    return people;  \n  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The `GetMutualFriends` operation takes a parameter of type `Person` and returns all the friends in the list who also have this person in their `friends` list.  \n  \n```  \npublic List<Person> GetMutualFriends(Person p)  \n{  \n    List<Person> mutual = new List<Person>();  \n    foreach (Person friend in p.Friends)  \n    {  \n        if (friend.Friends.Contains(p))  \n            mutual.Add(friend);  \n    }  \n    return mutual;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The `GetCommonFriends` operation takes a list of type `Person`. The list is expected to have two `Person` objects in it. The operation returns a list of `Person` objects that are in the `friends` lists of both `Person` objects in the input list.  \n  \n```  \npublic List<Person> GetCommonFriends(List<Person> people)  \n{  \n    List<Person> common = new List<Person>();  \n    foreach (Person friend in people[0].Friends)  \n        if (people[1].Friends.Contains(friend))  \n            common.Add(friend);  \n    return common;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Client  \n The client proxy is created using the **Add Service Reference** feature of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n A social network that consists of five `Person` objects is created. The client calls each of the three methods in the service.  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
