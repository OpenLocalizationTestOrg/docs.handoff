The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores features of the line, such as color and width.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example draws a line from (20, 10) to (300, 100). The first statement uses the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> class constructor to create a black pen. The one argument passed to the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object created with the <xref:System.Drawing.Color.FromArgb%2A> method. The values used to create the <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object — (255, 0, 0, 0) — correspond to the alpha, red, green, and blue components of the color. These values define an opaque black pen.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>\n- [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)\n- [Pens, Lines, and Rectangles in GDI+](pens-lines-and-rectangles-in-gdi.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,250],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use a Pen to Draw Lines\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
