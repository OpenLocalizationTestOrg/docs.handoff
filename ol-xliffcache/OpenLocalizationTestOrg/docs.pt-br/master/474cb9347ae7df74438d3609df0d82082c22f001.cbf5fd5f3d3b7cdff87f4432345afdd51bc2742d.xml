The creation of the tree itself is left as an exercise.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/cs/tpl.cs#16)]\n [!code-vb[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/vb/treewalk.vb#16)]  \n  \n The two methods shown are functionally equivalent. By using the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory.StartNew%2A> method to create and run the tasks, you get a handle back from the tasks which can be used to wait on the tasks and handle exceptions.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Task Parallel Library (TPL)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,79],"content":"How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]},{"pos":[428,478],"content":"How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks","linkify":"How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Traverse a Binary Tree with Parallel Tasks","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"The following example shows two ways in which parallel tasks can be used to traverse a tree data structure.","pos":[479,586]},{"content":"The creation of the tree itself is left as an exercise.","pos":[587,642]},{"pos":[651,658],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[662,850],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>TPL#16<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/cs/tpl.cs#16)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept> <bpt id=\"p3\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p4\">[</bpt>TPL#16<ept id=\"p4\">](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/vb/treewalk.vb#16)</ept><ept id=\"p3\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/cs/tpl.cs#16)]\n [!code-vb[TPL#16](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl/vb/treewalk.vb#16)]"},{"content":"The two methods shown are functionally equivalent.","pos":[857,907]},{"content":"By using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory.StartNew%2A&gt;</ph> method to create and run the tasks, you get a handle back from the tasks which can be used to wait on the tasks and handle exceptions.","pos":[908,1109],"source":" By using the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskFactory.StartNew%2A> method to create and run the tasks, you get a handle back from the tasks which can be used to wait on the tasks and handle exceptions."},{"pos":[1118,1126],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1130,1233],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Task Parallel Library (TPL)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl.md)</ept>","source":"[Task Parallel Library (TPL)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-parallel-library-tpl.md)"}]}
