The example then reads the rest of the characters in the string, stores them in the array starting at the sixth element, and displays the contents of the array.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.StringReader#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.stringreader/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.StringReader#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.stringreader/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Example: Read characters asynchronously  \n The next example is the code behind a WPF app. On window load, the example asynchronously reads all characters from a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control and stores them in an array. It then asynchronously writes each letter or white-space character to a separate line of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.StringReader#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StringReaderWriter/MainWindow.xaml.cs)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.StringReader#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StringReaderWriter/MainWindow.xaml.vb)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO.StringReader>  \n- <xref:System.IO.StringReader.Read%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>  \n- [Asynchronous file I/O](../../../docs/standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o.md)  \n- [How to: Create a directory listing](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5cf8zcfh(v=vs.100))  \n- [How to: Read and write to a newly created data file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-read-and-write-to-a-newly-created-data-file.md)  \n- [How to: Open and append to a log file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-open-and-append-to-a-log-file.md)  \n- [How to: Read text from a file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-read-text-from-a-file.md)  \n- [How to: Write text to a file](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-write-text-to-a-file.md)  \n- [How to: Write characters to a string](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-write-characters-to-a-string.md)  \n- [File and stream I/O](../../../docs/standard/io/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,478],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Read characters from a string\"\nms.date: \"01/21/2019\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  -
