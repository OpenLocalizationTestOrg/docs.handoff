One of the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object. To draw an opaque line, set the alpha component of the color to 255. To draw a semitransparent line, set the alpha component to any value from 1 through 254.  \n  \n When you draw a semitransparent line over a background, the color of the line is blended with the colors of the background. The alpha component specifies how the line and background colors are mixed; alpha values near 0 place more weight on the background colors, and alpha values near 255 place more weight on the line color.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example draws a bitmap and then draws three lines that use the bitmap as a background. The first line uses an alpha component of 255, so it is opaque. The second and third lines use an alpha component of 128, so they are semitransparent; you can see the background image through the lines. The statement that sets the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CompositingQuality%2A> property causes the blending for the third line to be done in conjunction with gamma correction.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the output of the following code.  \n  \n ![Opaque and Semitransparent](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/compqualline.png \"compqualline\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.AlphaBlending#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlphaBlending/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.AlphaBlending#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlphaBlending/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Alpha Blending Lines and Fills](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/alpha-blending-lines-and-fills.md)   \n [How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)   \n [How to: Draw with Opaque and Semitransparent Brushes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-with-opaque-and-semitransparent-brushes.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,545],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]}],"pos":[6,71],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"drawing, lines\"\n  - \"transparency, lines\"\n  - \"lines, drawing alpha blended\"\n  - \"alpha blending, drawing lines\"\nms.assetid: 8f2508af-f495-4223-b5cc-646cbbb520eb\ncaps.latest.revision: 18\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[552,597],"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","linkify":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"When you draw a line, you must pass a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen&gt;</ph> object to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[598,770],"source":"When you draw a line, you must pass a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"content":"One of the parameters of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A&gt;</ph> constructor is a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Color&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[771,889],"source":" One of the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object."},{"content":"To draw an opaque line, set the alpha component of the color to 255.","pos":[890,958]},{"content":"To draw a semitransparent line, set the alpha component to any value from 1 through 254.","pos":[959,1047]},{"content":"When you draw a semitransparent line over a background, the color of the line is blended with the colors of the background.","pos":[1054,1177]},{"content":"The alpha component specifies how the line and background colors are mixed;
