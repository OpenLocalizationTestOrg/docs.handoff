This can be caused by one of the following:  \n  \n-   The [/nostdlib](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md) option from the command line compiler has been specified. The /nostdlib option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll. Use this option if you want to define or create a user-specific System namespace.  \n  \n-   An incorrect mscorlib.dll is referenced.  \n  \n-   A corrupt Visual Studio .NET or .NET Framework common language runtime installation exists.  \n  \n-   Residual components from an earlier installation that are incompatible with the latest installation remain.  \n  \n To resolve this problem, take one of the following actions:  \n  \n-   Do not specify the /nostdlib option from the command line compiler.  \n  \n-   Make sure that the project refers to the correct mscorlib.dll.  \n  \n-   Reinstall the .NET Framework common language runtime (if the previous solutions do not solve the problem).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0518\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0518\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0518\"\nms.assetid: b0b61cbb-c9a7-48c9-9e60-7cdd5ecb3e6c","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0518","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0518","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Predefined type 'type' is not defined or imported","pos":[194,243]},{"content":"The main cause for this problem is that the project is not importing mscorlib.dll, which defines the entire System namespace.","pos":[250,375]},{"content":"This can be caused by one of the following:","pos":[376,419]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/nostdlib<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md)</ept> option from the command line compiler has been specified.","pos":[429,583],"source":"The [/nostdlib](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nostdlib-compiler-option.md) option from the command line compiler has been specified."},{"content":"The /nostdlib option prevents the import of mscorlib.dll.","pos":[584,641]},{"content":"Use this option if you want to define or create a user-specific System namespace.","pos":[642,723]},{"content":"An incorrect mscorlib.dll is referenced.","pos":[733,773]},{"content":"A corrupt Visual Studio .NET or .NET Framework common language runtime installation exists.","pos":[783,874]},{"content":"Residual components from an earlier installation that are incompatible with the latest installation remain.","pos":[884,991]},{"content":"To resolve this problem, take one of the following actions:","pos":[998,1057]},{"content":"Do not specify the /nostdlib option from the command line compiler.","pos":[1067,1134]},{"content":"Make sure that the project refers to the correct mscorlib.dll.","pos":[1144,1206]},{"content":"Reinstall the .NET Framework common language runtime (if the previous solutions do not solve the problem).","pos":[1216,1322]}]}
