The Help file can be either HTML or HTMLHelp 1.x or greater format.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To provide Help  \n  \n1.  From the **Toolbox**, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider> component to your form.  \n  \n     The component will reside in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider.HelpNamespace%2A> property to the .chm, .col, or .htm Help file.  \n  \n3.  Select another control you have on your form, and in the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider.SetHelpKeyword%2A> property.  \n  \n     This is the string passed through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider> component to your Help file to summon the appropriate Help topic.  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider.SetHelpNavigator%2A> property to a value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpNavigator> enumeration.  \n  \n     This determines the way in which the **HelpKeyword** property is passed to the Help system. The following table shows the possible settings and their descriptions.  \n  \n    |Member Name|Description|  \n    |-----------------|-----------------|  \n    |AssociateIndex|Specifies that the index for a specified topic is performed in the specified URL.|  \n    |Find|Specifies that the search page of a specified URL is displayed.|  \n    |Index|Specifies that the index of a specified URL is displayed.|  \n    |KeywordIndex|Specifies a keyword to search for and the action to take in the specified URL.|  \n    |TableOfContents|Specifies that the table of contents of the HTML 1.0 Help file is displayed.|  \n    |Topic|Specifies that the topic referenced by the specified URL is displayed.|  \n  \n At run time, pressing F1 when the control—for which you have set the **HelpKeyword** and **HelpNavigator** properties—has focus will open the Help file you associated with that <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider> component.  \n  \n Currently, the **HelpNamespace** property supports Help files in the following three formats: HTMLHelp 1.x, HTMLHelp 2.0, and HTML. Thus, you can set the **HelpNamespace** property to an http:// address, such as a Web page. If this is done, it will open the default browser to the Web page with the string specified in the **HelpKeyword** property used as the anchor. The anchor is used to jump to a specific part of an HTML page.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Be careful to check any information that is sent from a client before using it in your application. Malicious users might try to send or inject executable script, SQL statements, or other code. Before you display a user's input, store it in a database, or work with it, check that it does not contain potentially unsafe information. A typical way to check is to use a regular expression to look for keywords such as \"SCRIPT\" when you receive input from a user.  \n  \n You can also use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HelpProvider> component to show pop-up Help, even if you have it configured to display Help files for the controls on your Windows Forms.
