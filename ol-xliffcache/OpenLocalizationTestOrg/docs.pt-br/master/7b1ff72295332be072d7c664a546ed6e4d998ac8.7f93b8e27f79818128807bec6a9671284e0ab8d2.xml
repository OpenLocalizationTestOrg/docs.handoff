This topic discusses how to create a syndication service that exposes an RSS syndication feed.  \n  \n### To create a basic syndication service  \n  \n1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attribute. Each operation that is exposed as a syndication feed should return a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Syndication.Rss20FeedFormatter> object.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htRssBasic#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htrssbasic/cs/program.cs#0)]\n     [!code-vb[htRssBasic#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htrssbasic/vb/program.vb#0)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  All service operations that apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attribute are mapped to HTTP GET requests. To map your operation to a different HTTP method, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> instead. For more information, see [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md).  \n  \n2.
