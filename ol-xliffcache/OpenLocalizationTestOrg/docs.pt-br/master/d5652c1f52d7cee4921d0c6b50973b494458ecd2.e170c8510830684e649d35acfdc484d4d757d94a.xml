second print queue with exactly the same properties as an existing print queue.  \n  \n [Diagnose Problematic Print Job](how-to-diagnose-problematic-print-job.md)  \n Instructions for using the properties of print queues and print jobs to diagnose a print job that is not printing.  \n  \n [Discover Whether a Print Job Can Be Printed At This Time of Day](how-to-discover-whether-a-print-job-can-be-printed-at-this-time-of-day.md)  \n Instructions for using the properties of print queues and print jobs to programmatically decide what times of day the job can be printed.  \n  \n [Enumerate a Subset of Print Queues](how-to-enumerate-a-subset-of-print-queues.md)  \n Instructions for generating a list of printers having certain characteristics.
