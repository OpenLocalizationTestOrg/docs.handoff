The issues fall into two categories:  \n  \n [Runtime Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/runtime-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)  \n Runtime changes affect all apps that are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and that use a particular feature.  \n  \n [Retargeting Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)  \n Retargeting changes only affect apps that are recompiled to specifically target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]. Apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework behave as they did when running under those versions.  \n  \n In the items that describe runtime changes and retargeting changes, we have classified individual items by their expected impact, as follows:  \n  \n Major  \n This is a significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code.  \n  \n Minor  \n This is a change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.  \n  \n Edge case  \n This is a change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.  \n  \n Transparent  \n This is a change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user. The app should not require modification because of this change.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Application Compatibility](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,82],"content":"Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.6.1 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.6.1 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,70]}]},{"pos":[507,560],"content":"Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.6.1","linkify":"Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.6.1","nodes":[{"content":"Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.6.1","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"This topic provides links to information about application compatibility issues between the .NET Framework 4.6 and the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[561,735],"source":"This topic provides links to information about application compatibility issues between the .NET Framework 4.6 and the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]."},{"content":"The issues fall into two categories:","pos":[736,772]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Runtime Changes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/runtime-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)</ept>","pos":[779,883],"source":"[Runtime Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/runtime-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)"},{"content":"Runtime changes affect all apps that are running under the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]</ph> and that use a particular feature.","pos":[887,1035],"source":" Runtime changes affect all apps that are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and that use a particular feature."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retargeting Changes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)</ept>","pos":[1042,1154],"source":"[Retargeting Changes](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-6-1.md)"},{"content":"Retargeting changes only affect apps that are recompiled to specifically target the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[1158,1297],"source":" Retargeting changes only affect apps that are recompiled to specifically target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]."},{"content":"Apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework behave as they did when running under those versions.","pos":[1298,1408]},{"content":"In the items that describe runtime changes and retargeting changes, we have classified individual items by their expected impact, as follows:","pos":[1415,1556]},{"content":"Major","pos":[1563,1568]},{"content":"This is a significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code.","pos":[1572,1687]},{"content":"Minor","pos":[1694,1699]},{"content":"This is a change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.","pos":[1703,1800]},{"content":"Edge case","pos":[1807,1816]},{"content":"This is a change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.","pos":[1820,1905]},{"content":"Transparent","pos":[1912,1923]},{"content":"This is a change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user.","pos":[1927,2005]},{"content":"The app should not require modification because of this change.","pos":[2006,2069]},{"pos":[2078,2086],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2090,2187],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Application Compatibility<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility.md)</ept>","source":"[Application Compatibility](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility.md)"}]}
