If an application states that it's not DPI-aware, the operating system scales the application as a bitmap. This behavior is also called DPI virtualization. The application still thinks that it's running at 100% scaling, or 96 dpi.\n\nThis article discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.\n\n## Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors\n\nThe **Windows Forms Designer** in Visual Studio doesn't have scaling support. This causes display issues when you open some forms in the **Windows Forms Designer** on high dots per inch (HDPI) monitors. For examples, controls can appear to overlap as shown in the following image:\n\n![Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitor](./media/disable-dpi-awareness-visual-studio/win-forms-designer-hdpi.png)\n\nWhen you open a form in the **Windows Forms Designer** in Visual Studio on an HDPI monitor, Visual Studio displays a yellow informational bar at the top of the designer:\n\n![Informational bar in Visual Studio to restart in DPI-unaware mode](./media/disable-dpi-awareness-visual-studio/scaling-gold-bar.png)\n\nThe message reads **Scaling on your main display is set to 200% (192 dpi). This might cause rendering problems in the designer window.**\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This informational bar was introduced in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8.\n\nIf you aren't working in the designer and don't need to adjust the layout of your form, you can ignore the informational bar and continue working in the code editor or in other types of designers. (You can also [disable notifications](#disable-notifications) so that the informational bar doesn't continue to appear.) Only the **Windows Forms Designer** is affected. If you do need to work in the **Windows Forms Designer**, the next section helps you [resolve the problem](#to-resolve-the-display-problem).\n\n## To resolve the display problem\n\nThere are three options to resolve the display problem:\n\n1. [Restart Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process](#restart-visual-studio-as-a-dpi-unaware-process)\n2. [Add a registry entry](#add-a-registry-entry)\n3. [Set your display scaling setting to 100%](#set-your-display-scaling-setting-to-100)\n\n### Restart Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process\n\nYou can restart Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process by selecting the option on the yellow informational bar. This is the preferred way of resolving the problem.\n\nWhen Visual Studio runs as a DPI-unaware process, the designer layout issues are resolved, but fonts may appear blurry. Visual Studio displays a different yellow informational message when it runs as a DPI-unaware process that says **Visual Studio is running as a DPI-unaware process. WPF and XAML designers might not display correctly.** The informational bar also provides an option to **Restart Visual Studio as a DPI-aware process**.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> - If you had undocked tool windows in Visual Studio when you selected the option to restart as a DPI-unaware process, the position of those tool windows may change.\n> - If you use the default Visual Basic profile, or if you have the **Save new projects when created** option deselected in **Tools** > **Options** > **Projects and Solutions**, Visual Studio cannot reopen your project when it restarts as a DPI-unaware process. However, you can open the project by selecting it under **File** > **Recent Projects and Solutions**.\n\nIt's important to restart Visual Studio as a DPI-aware process when you're finished working in the **Windows Forms Designer**. When it's running as a DPI-unaware process, fonts can look blurry and you may see issues in other designers such as the **XAML Designer**. If you close and reopen Visual Studio when it's running in DPI-unaware mode, it becomes DPI-aware again. You can also click the **Restart Visual Studio as a DPI-aware process** option in the informational bar.\n\n### Add a registry entry\n\nYou can mark Visual Studio as DPI-unaware by modifying the registry. Open **Registry Editor** and add an entry to the **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\Layers** subkey:\n\n**Entry**: Depending on whether you're using Visual Studio 2017 or 2019, use one of these values:\n\n- C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2017\\Community\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exe\n- C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\Common7\\IDE\\devenv.exe\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're using the Professional or Enterprise edition of Visual Studio, replace **Community** with **Professional** or **Enterprise** in the entry. Also replace the drive letter as necessary.\n\n**Type**: REG_SZ\n\n**Value**: DPIUNAWARE\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Visual Studio remains in DPI-unaware mode until you remove the registry entry.\n\n### Set your display scaling setting to 100%\n\nTo set your display scaling setting to 100% in Windows 10, type **display settings** in the task bar search box, and then select **Change display settings**. In the **Settings** window, set **Change the size of text, apps, and other items** to **100%**.\n\nSetting your display scaling to 100% may be undesirable, because it can make the user interface too small to be usable.\n\n## Disable notifications\n\nYou can choose not to be notified of DPI scaling issues in Visual Studio. You might want to disable notifications if you aren't working in the designer, for example.\n\nTo disable notifications, choose **Tools** > **Options** to open the **Options** dialog. Then, choose **Windows Forms Designer** > **General**, and set **DPI Scaling Notifications** to **False**.\n\n![DPI scaling notifications option in Visual Studio](./media/disable-dpi-awareness-visual-studio/notifications-option.png)\n\nIf you want to later reenable scaling notifications, set the property to **True**.\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nIf the DPI-awareness transition isn't working as expected in Visual Studio, check to see if you have the `dpiAwareness` value in the **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\devenv.exe** subkey in Registry Editor. Delete the value if it's present.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Automatic scaling in Windows Forms](automatic-scaling-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,330],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio\ndescription: Discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.\nms.date: 04/05/2019\nms.prod: visual-studio-windows\nms.technology: vs-ide-designers\nauthor: gewarren\nms.author: gewarren\nms.custom: seoapril2019","nodes":[{"content":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","nodes":[{"content":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"Discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,123],"content":"Discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.","nodes":[{"content":"Discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.","pos":[0,123]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[337,375],"content":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","linkify":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","nodes":[{"content":"Disable DPI-awareness in Visual Studio","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"Visual Studio is a dots per inch (DPI) aware application, which means the display scales automatically.","pos":[377,480]},{"content":"If an application states that it's not DPI-aware, the operating system scales the application as a bitmap.","pos":[481,587]},{"content":"This behavior is also called DPI virtualization.","pos":[588,636]},{"content":"The application still thinks that it's running at 100% scaling, or 96 dpi.","pos":[637,711]},{"content":"This article discusses the limitations of Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors and how to run Visual Studio as a DPI-unaware process.","pos":[713,849]},{"pos":[854,893],"content":"Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors","linkify":"Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitors","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Forms Designer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in Visual Studio doesn't have scaling support.","pos":[895,972],"source":"The **Windows Forms Designer** in Visual Studio doesn't have scaling support."},{"content":"This causes display issues when you open some forms in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Forms Designer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on high dots per inch (HDPI) monitors.","pos":[973,1097],"source":" This causes display issues when you open some forms in the **Windows Forms Designer** on high dots per inch (HDPI) monitors."},{"content":"For examples, controls can appear to overlap as shown in the following image:","pos":[1098,1175]},{"content":"Windows Forms Designer on HDPI monitor","pos":[1179,1217]},{"pos":[1293,1462],"content":"When you open a form in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Forms Designer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in Visual Studio on an HDPI monitor, Visual Studio displays a yellow informational bar at the top of the designer:","source":"When you open a form in the **Windows Forms Designer** in Visual Studio on an HDPI monitor, Visual Studio displays a yellow informational bar at the top of the designer:"},{"content":"Informational bar in Visual Studio to restart in DPI-unaware mode","pos":[1466,1531]},{"pos":[1600,1736],"content":"The message reads <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Scaling on your main display is set to 200% (192 dpi).
