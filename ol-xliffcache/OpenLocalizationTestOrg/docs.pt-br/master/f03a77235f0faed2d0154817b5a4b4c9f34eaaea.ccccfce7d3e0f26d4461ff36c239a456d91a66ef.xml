The Win32 implementation of `VirtualFree` releases, decommits, or releases and decommits a region of pages within the virtual address space of the calling process.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT VirtualFree (  \n    [in] LPVOID  lpAddress,  \n    [in] SIZE_T  dwSize,  \n    [in] DWORD   dwFreeType  \n);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `lpAddress`  \n [in] A pointer to the base address of the virtual memory pages to be freed.  \n  \n `dwSize`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the region to be freed.  \n  \n `dwFreeType`  \n [in] The type of freeing operation.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`VirtualFree` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n|HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION|An attempt was made to free memory that was not allocated through the host.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `VirtualFree` frees virtual memory pages associated with the `lpAddress` parameter through an earlier call to the [IHostMemoryManager::VirtualAlloc](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-virtualalloc-method.md) function. Attempts to free memory that was not allocated through the host should return HOST_E_INVALIDOPERATION.  \n  \n The semantics are identical to those of the Win32 implementation of `VirtualFree`. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n
