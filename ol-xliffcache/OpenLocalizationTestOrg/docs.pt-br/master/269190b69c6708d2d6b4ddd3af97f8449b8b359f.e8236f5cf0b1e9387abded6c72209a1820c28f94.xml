Every collection has one shared default view, which is used as the actual binding source when a binding specifies a collection as its source. This example shows how to get the default view of a collection.  \n  \n## Example  \n To create the view, you need an object reference to the collection. This data object can be obtained by referencing your own code-behind object, by getting the data context, by getting a property of the data source, or by getting a property of the binding. This example shows how to get the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A> of a data object and use it to directly obtain the default collection view for this collection.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CollectionView#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionView/CSharp/Page1.xaml.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[CollectionView#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionView/VisualBasic/Page1.xaml.vb#2)]  \n  \n In this example, the root element is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>. The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A> is set to *myDataSource*, which refers to a data provider that is an <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601> of *Order* objects.  \n  \n [!code-xml[CollectionView#CollectionViewDataContext](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionView/CSharp/Page1.xaml#collectionviewdatacontext)]  \n  \n Alternatively, you can instantiate and bind to your own collection view using the <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource> class. This collection view is only shared by controls that bind to it directly. For an example, see the How to Create a View section in the [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md).  \n  \n For examples of the functionality provided by a collection view, see [Sort Data in a View](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-sort-data-in-a-view.md), [Filter Data in a View](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-filter-data-in-a-view.md), and [Navigate Through the Objects in a Data CollectionView](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-navigate-through-the-objects-in-a-data-collectionview.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Sort and Group Data Using a View in
