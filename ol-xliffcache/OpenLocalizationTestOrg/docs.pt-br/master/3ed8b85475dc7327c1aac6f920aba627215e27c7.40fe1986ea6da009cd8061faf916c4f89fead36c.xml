This may be an expected result if you have passed null for both `pBuffer` and `cchBuffer`, and queried the necessary buffer size by using `pdwLength`.  \n  \n HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_MOD_NOT_FOUND)  \n `szModuleName` does not contain a path to a valid CLR in the target process.  \n  \n E_FAIL (or other E_ return codes)  \n `pidDebuggee` does not refer to a valid process, or other failure.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n This function accepts a CLR process that is identified by `pidDebuggee` and a string path that is specified by `szModuleName`. The version string is returned in the buffer that `pBuffer` points to. This string is opaque to the function user; that is, there is no intrinsic meaning in the version string itself. It is used solely in the context of this function and the [CreateDebuggingInterfaceFromVersion function](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/createdebugginginterfacefromversion-function-for-silverlight.md).  \n  \n This function should be called twice. When you call it the first time, pass null for both `pBuffer` and `cchBuffer`. When you do this, the size of the buffer necessary for `pBuffer` will be returned in `pdwLength`. You can then call the function a second time, and pass the buffer in `pBuffer` and its size in `cchBuffer`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** dbgshim.h  \n  \n **Library:** dbgshim.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** 3.5
