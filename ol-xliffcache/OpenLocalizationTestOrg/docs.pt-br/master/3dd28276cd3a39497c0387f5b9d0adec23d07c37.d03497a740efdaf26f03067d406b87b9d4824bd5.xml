One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout. When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,141],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 8358898e-129e-4fac-a6bf-bf3aa4293ae2","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","pos":[0,57]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[148,205],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"An exception occurred while closing the connections in this connection pool.","pos":[206,282]},{"pos":[291,302],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This error level trace indicates that an error has occurred while closing the connection pools used by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)’s connection pooling feature.","pos":[306,477]},{"content":"One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout.","pos":[478,613]},{"content":"When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.","pos":[614,764]},{"pos":[773,781],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[785,858],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[861,1014],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[1017,1105],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
