In later topics, you will access the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed by using a Web browser, and also create a [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] client application that consumes the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed by using client libraries.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n To complete this quickstart, you must install the following components:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n-   An instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This includes SQL Server Express, which is included in a default installation of [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n-   The Northwind sample database. To download this sample database, see the download page, [Sample Databases for SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=24758).  \n  \n## WCF Data Services Quickstart Tasks  \n [Creating the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-data-service.md)  \n Define the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application, define the data model, create the data service, and enable access to resources.  \n  \n [Accessing the Service from a Web Browser](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/accessing-the-service-from-a-web-browser-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)  \n Start the service from [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] and access the service by submitting HTTP GET requests through a Web browser to the exposed feed.  \n  \n [Creating the .NET Framework Client Application](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-dotnet-client-application-wcf-data-services-quickstart.md)  \n Create a [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)] client application to consume the [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed, bind data to Windows controls, change data in the bound controls, and then send the changes back to the data service.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Project files from a completed version of the quickstart can be downloaded from the [WCF Data Services Documentation Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=179994) page.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n [Start the Quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/creating-the-data-service.md).
