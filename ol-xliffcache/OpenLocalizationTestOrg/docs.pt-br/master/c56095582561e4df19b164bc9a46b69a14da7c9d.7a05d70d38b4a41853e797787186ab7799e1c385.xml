The first two examples use static convenience methods on the <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName> class to write each element of any IEnumerable\\<string> and a string to a text file.  Example 3 shows how to add text to a file when you have to process each line individually as you write to the file.  Examples 1-3 overwrite all existing content in the file, but example 4 shows you how to append text to an existing file.  \n  \n These examples all write string literals to files, but more likely you will want to use the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method, which has many controls for writing different types of values  right or left justified in a field, with or without padding, and so on.  You can also use the C# [string interpolation](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings.md) feature.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csFilesandFolders#3](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-to-a-text-file_1.cs)]  \n  \n These examples all write string literals to files, but more likely you will want to use the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method, which has many controls for writing different types of values  right or left justified in a field, with or without padding, and so on.
