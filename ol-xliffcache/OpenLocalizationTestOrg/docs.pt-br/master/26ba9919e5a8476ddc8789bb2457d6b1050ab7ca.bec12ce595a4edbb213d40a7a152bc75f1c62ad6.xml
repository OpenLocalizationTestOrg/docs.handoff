If you intend to attach event handlers for these related events, be sure that their actions do not conflict. For example, if clicking the button clears information that the user has typed in a text box, pausing the mouse pointer over the button should not display a tool tip with that now-nonexistent information.  \n  \n If the user attempts to double-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control, each click will be processed separately; that is, the control does not support the double-click event.  \n  \n### To respond to a button click  \n  \n-   In the button's`Click` <xref:System.EventHandler> write the code to run. `Button1_Click` must be bound to the control. For more information, see [How to: Create Event Handlers at Run Time for Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/how-to-create-event-handlers-at-run-time-for-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n       MessageBox.Show(\"Button1 was clicked\")  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       MessageBox.Show(\"button1 was clicked\");  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp#  \n    private:  \n       void button1_Click(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::EventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          MessageBox::Show(\"button1 was clicked\");
