The `#Region` directive lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] code editor. The ability to hide code selectively makes your files more manageable and easier to read. For more information, see [Outlining](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/outlining).  \n  \n `#Region` directives support code block semantics such as `#If...#End If`. This means they cannot begin in one block and end in another; the start and end must be in the same block. `#Region` directives are not supported within functions.  \n  \n### To collapse and hide a section of code  \n  \n-   Place the section of code between the `#Region` and `#End Region` statements, as in the following example:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrConditionalComp#6](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-collapse-and-hide-sections-of-code_1.vb)]  \n  \n     The `#Region` block can be used multiple times in a code file; thus, users can define their own blocks of procedures and classes that can, in turn, be collapsed. `#Region` blocks can also be nested within other `#Region` blocks.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Hiding code does not prevent it from being compiled and does not affect `#If...#End If` statements.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Conditional Compilation](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/conditional-compilation.md)   \n [#Region Directive](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/region-directive.md)   \n [#If...Then...#Else Directives](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/if-then-else-directives.md)   \n [Outlining](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/outlining)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,86],"content":"How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,74]}]},{"pos":[696,753],"content":"How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`#Region`</ph> directive enables you to collapse and hide sections of code in <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]</ph> files.","pos":[754,927],"source":"The `#Region` directive enables you to collapse and hide sections of code in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] files."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`#Region`</ph> directive lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]</ph> code editor.","pos":[928,1102],"source":" The `#Region` directive lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] code editor."},{"content":"The ability to hide code selectively makes your files more manageable and easier to read.","pos":[1103,1192]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Outlining<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/outlining)</ept>.","pos":[1193,1286],"source":" For more information, see [Outlining](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/outlining)."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`#Region`</ph> directives support code block semantics such as <ph id=\"ph2\">`#If...#End If`</ph>.","pos":[1293,1367],"source":"`#Region` directives support code block semantics such as `#If...#End If`."},{"content":"This means they cannot begin in one block and end in another;
