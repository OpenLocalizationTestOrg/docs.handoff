You can also customize many aspects of the model and its behavior.  \n  \n If you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)], you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to create your object model.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Generate the Object Model in Visual Basic or C#](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-generate-the-object-model-in-visual-basic-or-csharp.md)  \n Describes how to use the SQLMetal command-line tool. Also provides a link to the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] users  \n  \n [How to: Generate the Object Model as an External File](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-generate-the-object-model-as-an-external-file.md)  \n Describes how to generate an external mapping file instead of using attribute-based mapping.  \n  \n [How to: Generate Customized Code by Modifying a DBML File](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-generate-customized-code-by-modifying-a-dbml-file.md)  \n Describes how to generate [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or C# code from a DBML metadata file.  \n  \n [How to: Validate DBML and External Mapping Files](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-validate-dbml-and-external-mapping-files.md)  \n Describes how to validate mapping files that you have modified (advanced).  \n  \n [How to: Make Entities Serializable](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-make-entities-serializable.md)  \n Describes how to add appropriate attributes to make entities serializable.  \n  \n [How to: Customize Entity Classes by Using the Code Editor](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-customize-entity-classes-by-using-the-code-editor.md)  \n Describes how to use the code editor to write your own mapping code, or customize code that has been autogenerated.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [The LINQ to SQL Object Model](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/the-linq-to-sql-object-model.md)  \n Provides details about the [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] object model.  \n  \n [Typical Steps for Using LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/typical-steps-for-using-linq-to-sql.md)  \n Explains the typical steps that you follow to implement a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] application.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"Creating the Object Model | Microsoft
