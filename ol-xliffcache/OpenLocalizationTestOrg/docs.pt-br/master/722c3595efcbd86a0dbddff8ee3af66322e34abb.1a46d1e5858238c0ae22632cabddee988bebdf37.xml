It does almost everything that a list box does and also can display a check mark next to items in the list. Other differences between the two controls are that checked list boxes only support <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DrawMode?displayProperty=fullName>; and that checked list boxes can only have one item or none selected. Note that a selected item appears highlighted on the form and is not the same as a checked item.  \n  \n Checked list boxes can have items added at design time using the **String Collection Editor** or their items can added dynamically from a collection at run time, using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox.Items%2A> property.
