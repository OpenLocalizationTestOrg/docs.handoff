The most important class, <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort>, provides a framework for synchronous and event-driven I/O, access to pin and break states, and access to serial driver properties. It can be wrapped in a <xref:System.IO.Stream> object, accessible through the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.BaseStream> property. Wrapping <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> in a <xref:System.IO.Stream> object allows the serial port to be accessed by classes that use streams. The namespace includes enumerations that simplify the control of serial ports.  \n  \n The simplest way to create a <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object is through the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports.OpenSerialPort%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot use [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] classes to directly access other types of ports, such as parallel ports, USB ports, and so on.  \n  \n## Enumerations  \n This table lists and describes the main enumerations used for accessing a serial port:  \n  \n|Enumeration|Description|  \n|---|---|   \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.Handshake>|Specifies the control protocol used in establishing a serial port communication for a <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.Parity>|Specifies the parity bit for a <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialData>|Specifies the type of character that was received on the serial port of the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialError>|Specifies errors that occur on the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPinChange>|Specifies the type of change that occurred on the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort> object.|  \n|<xref:System.IO.Ports.StopBits>|Specifies the number of stop
