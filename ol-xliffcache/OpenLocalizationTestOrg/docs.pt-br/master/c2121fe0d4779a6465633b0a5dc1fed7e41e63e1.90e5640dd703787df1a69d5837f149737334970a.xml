To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush> object. The following example demonstrates how to fill an ellipse with a hatch pattern:  \n  \n## Example  \n The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background. The hatch style argument can be any value from the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration. There are more than fifty elements in the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration; a few of those elements are shown in the following list:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle>  \n  \n The following illustration shows the filled ellipse.  \n  \n ![Hatch Pattern](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/hatch1.png \"hatch1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#41](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#41](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using a Brush to Fill Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[534,575],"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","linkify":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"A hatch pattern is made from two colors: one for the background and one for the lines that form the pattern over the background.","pos":[576,704]},{"content":"To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[705,806],"source":" To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush> object."},{"content":"The following example demonstrates how to fill an ellipse with a hatch pattern:","pos":[807,886]},{"pos":[895,902],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A&gt;</ph> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background.","pos":[906,1077],"source":"The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background."},{"content":"The hatch style argument can be any value from the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle&gt;</ph> enumeration.","pos":[1078,1184],"source":" The hatch style argument can be any value from the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration."},{"content":"There are more than fifty elements in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle&gt;</ph> enumeration;
