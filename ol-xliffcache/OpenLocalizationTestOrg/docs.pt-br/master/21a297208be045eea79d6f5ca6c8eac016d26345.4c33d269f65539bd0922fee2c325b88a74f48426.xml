A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> is a type of <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline> that provides targeting information for the timelines it contains. Use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> to provide timeline targeting information, including object and property information.  \n  \n To begin an animation, use one or more <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> objects as nested child elements of a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>. These <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> objects can contain other animations and therefore, can better encapsulate the timing sequences in complex animations. For example, if you are animating a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> and several shapes in the same <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>, you can separate the animations for the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> and the shapes, putting each into a separate <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline>. Because each <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> has its own <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.BeginTime%2A> and all child elements of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> begin relative to this <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.BeginTime%2A>, timing is better encapsulated.  \n  \n The following example animates two pieces of text (<xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> objects) from within the same <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>. A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> encapsulates the animations of one of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> objects.  \n  \n **Performance Note:** Although you can nest <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> timelines inside each other, <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline>s are more suitable for nesting because they require less overhead. (The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> class inherits from the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ParallelTimeline> class.)  \n  \n## Example  \n
