The following sections discuss these methods in detail.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [File Access with Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/file-access.md)  \n Discusses how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to work with files, drives, and folders.  \n  \n [Basics of .NET Framework File I/O and the File System (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/basics-of-net-framework-file-io-and-the-file-system.md)  \n Provides an overview of file I/O concepts in the .NET Framework, including streams, isolated storage, file events, file attributes, and file access.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files by Using .NET Framework Methods](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-by-using-net-framework-methods.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] to manipulate files and folders.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to manipulate files and folders.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/program-structure-and-code-conventions.md)  \n Provides guidelines for the physical structure and appearance of programs.  \n
