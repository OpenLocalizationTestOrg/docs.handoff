{"content":"---\ntitle: \"association end\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 2c345213-0296-4d90-ac6d-cef179798a75\n---\n# association end\nAn *association end* identifies the [entity type](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) on one end of an [association](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md) and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association. Association ends are defined as part of an association; an association must have exactly two association ends. [Navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) allow for navigation from one association end to the other.  \n  \n An association end definition contains the following information:  \n  \n-   One of the entity types involved in the association. (Required)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  For a given association, the entity type specified for each association end can be the same. This creates a self-association.  \n  \n-   An [association end multiplicity](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end-multiplicity.md) that indicates the number of entity type instances that can be at one end of the association. An association end multiplicity can have a value of one (1), zero or one (0..1), or many (\\*).  \n  \n-   A name for the association end. (Optional)  \n  \n-   Information about operations that are performed on the association end, such as cascade on delete. (Optional)  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `PublishedBy` and `WrittenBy`. The association ends for the `PublishedBy` association are the `Book` and `Publisher` entity types. The multiplicity of the `Publisher` end is one (1) and the multiplicity of the `Book` end is many (\\*), indicating that a publisher publishes many books and a book is published by one publisher.  \n  \n ![Example model with three entity types](./media/association-end/example-model-three-entity-types.gif)  \n  \n The ADO.NET Entity Framework uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The CSDL below defines the `PublishedBy` association shown in the diagram above. Note that the type, name, and multiplicity of each association end are specified by XML attributes (the `Type`, `Role`, and `Multiplicity` attributes, respectively). Optional information about operations performed on an end is specified in an XML element (the `OnDelete` element). In this case, if a publisher is deleted, so are all associated books.  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#AssociationEnd](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books3.edmx#associationend)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)\n- [Entity Data Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,99],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"association end\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 2c345213-0296-4d90-ac6d-cef179798a75","nodes":[{"content":"association end","nodes":[{"pos":[0,15],"content":"association end","nodes":[{"content":"association end","pos":[0,15]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[106,121],"content":"association end","linkify":"association end","nodes":[{"content":"association end","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>association end<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> identifies the <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>entity type<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md)</ept> on one end of an <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>association<ept id=\"p3\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md)</ept> and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association.","pos":[122,403],"source":"An *association end* identifies the [entity type](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) on one end of an [association](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md) and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association."},{"content":"Association ends are defined as part of an association; an association must have exactly two association ends.","pos":[404,514]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Navigation properties<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md)</ept> allow for navigation from one association end to the other.","pos":[515,661],"source":"[Navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) allow for navigation from one association end to the other."},{"content":"An association end definition contains the following information:","pos":[668,733]},{"content":"One of the entity types involved in the association.","pos":[743,795]},{"content":"(Required)","pos":[796,806]},{"pos":[818,958],"content":"[!NOTE]\nFor a given association, the entity type specified for each association end can be the same.
