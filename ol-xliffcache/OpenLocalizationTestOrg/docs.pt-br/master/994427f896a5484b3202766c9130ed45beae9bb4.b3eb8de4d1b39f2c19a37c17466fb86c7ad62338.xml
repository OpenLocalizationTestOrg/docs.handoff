[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides three correlation mechanisms to help diagnose the cause of an error: activities, transfers, and propagation.  \n  \n See [End-To-End Tracing Scenarios](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/end-to-end-tracing-scenarios.md) for a list of end-to-end tracing scenarios, and their respective activity and tracing design.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Activity](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/activity.md):  Describes activity traces in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model.  \n  \n [Transfer](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/transfer.md):  Describes transfer in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model, and using transfer to correlate activities within endpoints.  \n  \n [Propagation](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/propagation.md):  Describes activity propagation in the [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] tracing model, and using propagation to correlate activities across endpoints.  \n  \n [Trace Type
