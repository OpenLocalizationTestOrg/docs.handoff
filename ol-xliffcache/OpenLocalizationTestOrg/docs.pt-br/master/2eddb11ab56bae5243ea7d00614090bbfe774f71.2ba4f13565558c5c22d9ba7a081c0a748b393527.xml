The task remains in a suspended state until it is explicitly started by a call to [IHostTask::Start](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-start-method.md).  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`CreateTask` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to create the requested task.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The CLR calls `CreateTask` to request that the host create a new task. The host returns an interface pointer to an `IHostTask` instance. The returned task must remain suspended until it is explicitly started by a call to `IHostTask::Start`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
