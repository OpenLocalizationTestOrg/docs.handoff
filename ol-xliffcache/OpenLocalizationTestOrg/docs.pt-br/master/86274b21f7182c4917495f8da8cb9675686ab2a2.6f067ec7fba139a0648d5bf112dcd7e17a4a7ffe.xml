[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] provides.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ServiceModel Transaction Attributes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/servicemodel-transaction-attributes.md)  \n Describes the two standard <xref:System.ServiceModel> attributes that enable you to configure the behavior of transactions for a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n [ServiceModel Transaction Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/servicemodel-transaction-configuration.md)  \n Describes the various configuration settings that can be used to enable transaction for a service.  \n  \n [Enabling Transaction Flow](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/enabling-transaction-flow.md)  \n Describes how to enable transaction flow.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Transactional Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-transactional-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a transactional service in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [Diagnosing Transactional Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/diagnosing-transactional-applications.md)  \n Describes how to use the management and diagnostics feature in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to troubleshoot your transactional application.  \n  \n [Comparing Transactions in COM+ and ServiceModel](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/comparing-transactions-in-com-and-servicemodel.md)  \n Describes how to simulate the behavior of a transactional COM+ service using the attributes provided by the <xref:System.ServiceModel> namespace.  \n  \n [Integrating Enterprise Services Transactional Components](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-enterprise-services-transactional-components.md)  \n Describes how to integrate your [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services with code that uses enterprise service.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,73],"content":"Transactional Support in System.ServiceModel | Microsoft
