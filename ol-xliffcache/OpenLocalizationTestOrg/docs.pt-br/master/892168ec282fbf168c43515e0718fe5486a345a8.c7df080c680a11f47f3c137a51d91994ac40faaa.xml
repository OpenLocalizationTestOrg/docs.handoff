{"content":"---\ntitle: \"DataGridView Control Architecture (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], architecture\"\nms.assetid: 1c6cabf0-02ee-4bbc-9574-b54bb7f5b19e\n---\n# DataGridView Control Architecture (Windows Forms)\nThe <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and its related classes are designed to be a flexible, extensible system for displaying and editing tabular data. These classes are all contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace, and they are all named with the \"DataGridView\" prefix.  \n  \n## Architecture Elements  \n The primary <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> companion classes derive from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement>. The following object model illustrates the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement> inheritance hierarchy.  \n  \n ![Diagram that shows the DataGridViewElement Object Model hierarchy.](./media/datagridview-control-architecture-windows-forms/datagridviewelement-object-model.gif)  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement> class provides a reference to the parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control and has a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement.State%2A> property, which holds a value that represents a combination of values from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates> enumeration.  \n  \n The following sections describe the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> companion classes in more detail.  \n  \n### DataGridViewElementStates  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates> enumeration contains the following values:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.None>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Frozen>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.ReadOnly>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Resizable>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.ResizableSet>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Selected>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Visible>  \n  \n The values of this enumeration can be combined with the bitwise logical operators, so the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement.State%2A> property can express more than one state at once. For example, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElement> can be simultaneously <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Frozen>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Selected>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewElementStates.Visible>.  \n  \n### Cells and Bands  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control comprises two fundamental kinds of objects: cells and bands. All cells derive from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> base class. The two kinds of bands, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow>, both derive from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewBand> base class.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control interoperates with several classes, but the most commonly encountered are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow>.  \n  \n### DataGridViewCell  \n The cell is the fundamental unit of interaction for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>. Display is centered on cells, and data entry is often performed through cells. You can access cells by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow.Cells%2A> collection of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow> class, and you can access the selected cells by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectedCells%2A> collection of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. The following object model illustrates this usage and shows the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> inheritance hierarchy.  \n  \n ![Diagram that shows the DataGridViewCell Object Model hierarchy.](./media/datagridview-control-architecture-windows-forms/datagridviewcell-object-model.gif)  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> type is an abstract base class, from which all cell types derive. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> and its derived types are not Windows Forms controls, but some host Windows Forms controls. Any editing functionality supported by a cell is typically handled by a hosted control.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> objects do not control their own appearance and painting features in the same way as Windows Forms controls. Instead, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> is responsible for the appearance of its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> objects. You can significantly affect the appearance and behavior of cells by interacting with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's properties and events. When you have special requirements for customizations that are beyond the capabilities of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, you can implement your own class that derives from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell> or one of its child classes.  \n  \n The following list shows the classes derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell>:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewHeaderCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowHeaderCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumnHeaderCell>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTopLeftHeaderCell>  \n  \n-   Your custom cell types  \n  \n### DataGridViewColumn  \n The schema of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's attached data store is expressed in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's columns. You can access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's columns by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Columns%2A> collection. You can access the selected columns by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectedColumns%2A> collection. The following object model illustrates this usage and shows the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> inheritance hierarchy.  \n  \n ![Diagram that shows the DataGridViewColumn Object Model hierarchy.](./media/datagridview-control-architecture-windows-forms/datagridviewcolumn-object-model.gif)  \n  \n Some of the key cell types have corresponding column types. These are derived from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn> base class.  \n  \n The following list shows the classes derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn>:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonColumn>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxColumn>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxColumn>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkColumn>  \n  \n-   Your custom column types  \n  \n### DataGridView Editing Controls  \n Cells that support advanced editing functionality typically use a hosted control that is derived from a Windows Forms control. These controls also implement the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IDataGridViewEditingControl> interface. The following object model illustrates the usage of these controls.  \n  \n ![Diagram showing the DataGridView Editing Control Object Model hierarchy.](./media/datagridview-control-architecture-windows-forms/datagridviewediting-object-model.gif)  \n  \n The following editing controls are provided with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxEditingControl>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl>  \n  \n For information about creating your own editing controls, see [How to: Host Controls in Windows Forms DataGridView Cells](how-to-host-controls-in-windows-forms-datagridview-cells.md).  \n  \n The following table illustrates the relationship among cell types, column types, and editing controls.  \n  \n|Cell type|Hosted control|Column type|  \n|---------------|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonCell>|n/a|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewButtonColumn>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxCell>|n/a|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxCell>|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxEditingControl>|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxColumn>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageCell>|n/a|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewImageColumn>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkCell>|n/a|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewLinkColumn>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxCell>|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxEditingControl>|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewTextBoxColumn>|  \n  \n### DataGridViewRow  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow> class displays a record's data fields from the data store to which the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control is attached. You can access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's rows by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Rows%2A> collection. You can access the selected rows by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectedRows%2A> collection. The following object model illustrates this usage and shows the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow> inheritance hierarchy.  \n  \n ![Diagram that shows the DataGridViewRow Object Model hierarchy.](./media/datagridview-control-architecture-windows-forms/datagridviewrow-object-model.gif)\n  \n You can derive your own types from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow> class, although this will typically not be necessary. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control has several row-related events and properties for customizing the behavior of its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRow> objects.  \n  \n If you enable the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToAddRows%2A> property, a special row for adding new rows appears as the last row. This row is part of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.Rows%2A> collection, but it has special functionality that may require your attention. For more information, see [Using the Row for New Records in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](using-the-row-for-new-records-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
