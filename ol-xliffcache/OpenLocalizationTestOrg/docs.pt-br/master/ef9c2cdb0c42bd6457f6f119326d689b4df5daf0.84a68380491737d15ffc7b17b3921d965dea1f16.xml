All operator procedures must be `Public` `Shared`.  \n  \n Defining an operator on a class or structure is also called *overloading* the operator.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example defines the `+` operator for a structure called `height`. The structure uses heights measured in feet and inches. One *inch* is 2.54 centimeters, and one *foot* is 12 inches. To ensure normalized values (inches < 12.0), the constructor performs *modulo* 12 arithmetic. The `+` operator uses the constructor to generate normalized values.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#25](./codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-define-an-operator_1.vb)]  \n  \n You can test the structure `height` with the following code.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnProcedures#26](./codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-define-an-operator_2.vb)]  \n  \n For more information and examples, see [Operator Overloading in Visual Basic 2005](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=101703).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Operator Procedures](./operator-procedures.md)   \n [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](./how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)   \n [How to: Call an Operator Procedure](./how-to-call-an-operator-procedure.md)   \n [How to: Use a Class that Defines Operators](./how-to-use-a-class-that-defines-operators.md)   \n [Operator Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)   \n [Structure Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)   \n [How to: Declare a Structure](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)   \n [Mod Operator](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/mod-operator.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"How to: Define an Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define an Operator (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[930,971],"content":"How to: Define an Operator (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Define an Operator (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define an Operator (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[972,1170],"content":"If you have defined a class or structure, you can define the behavior of a standard operator (such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`*`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`&lt;&gt;`</ph>, or <ph id=\"ph3\">`And`</ph>) when one or both of the operands is of the type of your class or structure.","source":"If you have defined a class or structure, you can define the behavior of a standard operator (such as `*`, `<>`, or `And`) when one or both of the operands is of the type of your class or structure."},{"content":"Define the standard operator as an operator procedure within the class or structure.","pos":[1177,1261]},{"content":"All operator procedures must be <ph id=\"ph1\">`Public`</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`Shared`</ph>.","pos":[1262,1312],"source":" All operator procedures must be `Public` `Shared`."},{"pos":[1319,1406],"content":"Defining an operator on a class or structure is also called <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>overloading<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> the operator.","source":"Defining an operator on a class or structure is also called *overloading* the operator."},{"pos":[1415,1422],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example defines the <ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> operator for a structure called <ph id=\"ph2\">`height`</ph>.","pos":[1426,1505],"source":"The following example defines the `+` operator for a structure called `height`."},{"content":"The structure uses heights measured in feet and inches.","pos":[1506,1561]},{"content":"One <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>inch<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> is 2.54 centimeters, and one <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>foot<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> is 12 inches.","pos":[1562,1622],"source":" One *inch* is 2.54 centimeters, and one *foot* is 12 inches."},{"content":"To ensure normalized values (inches &lt;
