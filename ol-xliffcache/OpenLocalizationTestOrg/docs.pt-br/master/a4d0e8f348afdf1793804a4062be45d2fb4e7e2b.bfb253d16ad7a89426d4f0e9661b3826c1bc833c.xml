The object initializer syntax enables you to specify arguments for a constructor or omit the arguments (and parentheses syntax).  The following example shows how to use an object initializer with a named type, `Cat` and how to invoke the default constructor. Note the use of auto-implemented properties in the `Cat` class. For more information, see [Auto-Implemented Properties](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/auto-implemented-properties.md).  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#39](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/object-and-collection-initializers_1.cs)]  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#45](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/object-and-collection-initializers_2.cs)]  \n  \n## Object Initializers with anonymous types  \n Although object initializers can be used in any context, they are especially useful in [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query expressions. Query expressions make frequent use of [anonymous types](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/anonymous-types.md), which can only be initialized by using an object initializer, as shown in the following declaration.  \n  \n```csharp\nvar pet = new { Age = 10, Name = \"Fluffy\" };  \n```  \n  \n Anonymous types enable the `select` clause in a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query expression to transform objects of the original sequence into objects whose value and shape may differ from the original. This is useful if you want to store only a part of the information from each object in a sequence. In the following example, assume that a product object (`p`) contains many fields and methods, and that you are only interested in creating a sequence of objects that contain the product name and the unit price.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#40](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/object-and-collection-initializers_3.cs)]  \n  \n When this query is executed, the `productInfos` variable will contain a sequence of objects that can be accessed in a `foreach` statement as shown in this example:  \n  \n```csharp\nforeach(var p in productInfos){...}  \n```  \n  \n Each object in the new anonymous type has two public properties which receive the same names as the properties or fields in the original object. You can also rename a field when you are creating an anonymous type; the following example renames the `UnitPrice` field to `Price`.  \n  \n```csharp\nselect new {p.ProductName, Price = p.UnitPrice};  \n```  \n  \n## Object initializers with nullable types  \n It is a compile-time error to use an object initializer with a nullable struct.  \n  \n## Collection initializers  \n Collection initializers let you specify one or more element initializers when you initialize a collection type that implements <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> and has `Add` with the appropriate signature as an instance method or an extension method. The element initializers can be a simple value, an expression or an object initializer. By using a collection initializer you do not have to specify multiple calls to the `Add` method of the class in your source code; the compiler adds the calls.  \n  \n The following examples shows two simple collection initializers:  \n  \n```csharp\nList<int> digits = new List<int> { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };  \nList<int> digits2 = new List<int> { 0 + 1, 12 % 3, MakeInt() };  \n```  \n  \n The following collection initializer uses object initializers to initialize objects of the `Cat` class defined in a previous example. Note that the individual object initializers are enclosed in braces and separated by commas.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#41](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/object-and-collection-initializers_4.cs)]  \n  \n You can specify [null](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/null.md) as an element in a collection initializer if the collection's `Add` method allows it.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#42](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/object-and-collection-initializers_5.cs)]  \n  \n You can specify indexed elements if the collection supports indexing.  \n  \n```csharp\nvar numbers = new Dictionary<int, string> {   \n    [7] = \"seven\",   \n    [9] = \"nine\",   \n    [13] = \"thirteen\"   \n};  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n
