By default, the `ComboBox` control appears in two parts: the top part is a text box that allows the user to type a list item. The second part is a list box that displays a list of items from which the user can select one.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ComboBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/combobox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Create Variable Sized Text in a ComboBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-variable-sized-text-in-a-combobox-control.md)  \n Demonstrates custom drawing of text in a `ComboBox` control.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> class  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)  \n Provides a list of things you can do with list boxes, combo boxes, and checked list boxes.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"ComboBox Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ComboBox Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[686,718],"content":"ComboBox Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"ComboBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"ComboBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`ComboBox`</ph> control is used to display data in a drop-down combo box.","pos":[719,805],"source":"The Windows Forms `ComboBox` control is used to display data in a drop-down combo box."},{"content":"By default, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ComboBox`</ph> control appears in two parts: the top part is a text box that allows the user to type a list item.","pos":[806,931],"source":" By default, the `ComboBox` control appears in two parts: the top part is a text box that allows the user to type a list item."},{"content":"The second part is a list box that displays a list of items from which the user can select one.","pos":[932,1027]},{"pos":[1036,1051],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ComboBox Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/combobox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1055,1171],"source":"[ComboBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/combobox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.","pos":[1175,1241]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Variable Sized Text in a ComboBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-variable-sized-text-in-a-combobox-control.md)</ept>","pos":[1248,1411],"source":"[How to: Create Variable Sized Text in a ComboBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-variable-sized-text-in-a-combobox-control.md)"},{"content":"Demonstrates custom drawing of text in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`ComboBox`</ph> control.","pos":[1415,1475],"source":" Demonstrates custom drawing of text in a `ComboBox` control."},{"pos":[1484,1493],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox&gt;</ph> class","pos":[1497,1539],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> class"},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1543,1597]},{"pos":[1606,1622],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)</ept>","pos":[1626,1764],"source":"[Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)"},{"content":"Provides a list of things you can do with list boxes, combo boxes, and checked list boxes.","pos":[1768,1858]},{"pos":[1867,1875],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1879,1995],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"}]}
