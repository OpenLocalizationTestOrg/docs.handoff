Note that the body of the method constructs an expression that captures the intent of the method call, and passes that expression to the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> for translation and execution.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Direct execution occurs only if the function is called outside a query. For more information, see [How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-call-user-defined-functions-inline.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following SQL code presents a scalar-valued user-defined function `ReverseCustName()`.  \n  \n```  \nCREATE FUNCTION ReverseCustName(@string varchar(100))  \nRETURNS varchar(100)  \nAS  \nBEGIN  \n    DECLARE @custName varchar(100)  \n    -- Implementation left as exercise for users.  \n    RETURN @custName  \nEND  \n```  \n  \n You would map a client method such as the following for this code:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/northwind-tfunc.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/northwind-tfunc.vb#3)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,166],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: 714e252f-c053-4bbb-b1f3-924111cd4d97","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[173,221],"content":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","linkify":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Scalar-Valued User-Defined Functions","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"You can map a client method defined on a class to a user-defined function by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.FunctionAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute.","pos":[222,369],"source":"You can map a client method defined on a class to a user-defined function by using the <xref:System.Data.Linq.Mapping.FunctionAttribute> attribute."},{"content":"Note that the body of the method constructs an expression that captures the intent of the method call, and passes that expression to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> for translation and execution.","pos":[370,573],"source":" Note that the body of the method constructs an expression that captures the intent of the method call, and passes that expression to the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> for translation and execution."},{"pos":[581,835],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Direct execution occurs only if the function is called outside a query.
