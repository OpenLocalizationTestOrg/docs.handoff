XML comment will be ignored.  \n  \n Tags can have a `cref` attribute that designates a link to another element of the XML by specifying the relative name of the identifier. At compile time, the compiler replaces the value with the qualified XML identifier for the value pointed at by the user. The compiler uses its normal resolution rules for finding the type or member.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42309  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Validate the `cref` attribute so that it points to a valid code element.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Create XML Documentation](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-create-xml-documentation.md)   \n [XML Comment Tags](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-xml-tags-for-documentation-comments.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,137],"content":"XML comment has a tag with a &#39;cref&#39; attribute &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; that could not be resolved | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"XML comment has a tag with a &amp;#39;cref&amp;#39; attribute &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>attribute<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; that could not be resolved | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,125],"source":"XML comment has a tag with a &#39;cref&#39; attribute &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; that could not be resolved | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[654,762],"content":"XML comment has a tag with a &#39;cref&#39; attribute &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; that could not be resolved","linkify":"XML comment has a tag with a &#39;cref&#39; attribute &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; that could not be resolved","nodes":[{"content":"XML comment has a tag with a &amp;#39;cref&amp;#39; attribute &amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>attribute<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; that could not be resolved","pos":[0,108],"source":"XML comment has a tag with a &#39;cref&#39; attribute &#39;&lt;attribute&gt;&#39; that could not be resolved"}]},{"content":"XML comment has a tag with a 'cref' attribute <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>attribute&gt; that could not be resolved.","pos":[763,849],"source":"XML comment has a tag with a 'cref' attribute \\<attribute> that could not be resolved."},{"content":"XML comment will be ignored.","pos":[850,878]},{"content":"Tags can have a <ph id=\"ph1\">`cref`</ph> attribute that designates a link to another element of the XML by specifying the relative name of the identifier.","pos":[885,1021],"source":"Tags can have a `cref` attribute that designates a link to another element of the XML by specifying the relative name of the identifier."},{"content":"At compile time, the compiler replaces the value with the qualified XML identifier for the value pointed at by the user.","pos":[1022,1142]},{"content":"The compiler uses its normal resolution rules for finding the type or member.","pos":[1143,1220]},{"pos":[1227,1248],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC42309","source":"**Error ID:** BC42309"},{"pos":[1257,1278],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1288,1360],"content":"Validate the <ph id=\"ph1\">`cref`</ph> attribute so that it points to a valid code element.","source":"Validate the `cref` attribute so that it points to a valid code element."},{"pos":[1369,1377],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create XML Documentation<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-create-xml-documentation.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1381,1507],"source":"[How to: Create XML Documentation](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-create-xml-documentation.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>XML Comment Tags<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-xml-tags-for-documentation-comments.md)</ept>","pos":[1510,1626],"source":" [XML Comment Tags](../../visual-basic/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-xml-tags-for-documentation-comments.md)"}]}
