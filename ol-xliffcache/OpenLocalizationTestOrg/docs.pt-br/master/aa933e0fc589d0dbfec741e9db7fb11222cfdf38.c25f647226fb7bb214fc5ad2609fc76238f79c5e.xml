They include examples of the <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate, the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate, and a custom delegate, to illustrate events with and without data.  \n  \n The examples use concepts described in the [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md) article.  \n  \n## Example  \n The first example shows how to raise and consume an event that doesn't have data. It contains a class named `Counter` that has an event named `ThresholdReached`. This event is raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value. The <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[EventsOverview#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cs/programnodata.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[EventsOverview#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1nodata.vb#5)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The next example shows how to raise and consume an event that provides data. The <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate is associated with the event, and an instance of a custom event data object is provided.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cpp/programwithdata.cpp#6)]\n [!code-csharp[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cs/programwithdata.cs#6)]\n [!code-vb[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1withdata.vb#6)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The next example shows how to declare a delegate for an event. The delegate is named `ThresholdReachedEventHandler`. This is just an illustration. Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the <xref:System.EventHandler> or the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate. You should declare a delegate only in rare scenarios, such as making your class available to legacy code that cannot use generics.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[EventsOverview#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cs/programwithdelegate.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[EventsOverview#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1withdelegate.vb#7)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,352],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Raise and Consume Events\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"events [.NET Framework], raising\"\n  - \"raising events\"\n  - \"events [.NET Framework], samples\"\nms.assetid: 42afade7-3a02-4f2e-868b-95845f302f8f\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[359,391],"content":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","linkify":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Raise and Consume Events","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The examples in this topic show how to work with events.","pos":[392,448]},{"content":"They include examples of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler&gt;</ph> delegate, the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler%601&gt;</ph> delegate, and a custom delegate, to illustrate events with and without data.","pos":[449,626],"source":" They include examples of the <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate, the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate, and a custom delegate, to illustrate events with and without data."},{"pos":[633,733],"content":"The examples use concepts described in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)</ept> article.","source":"The examples use concepts described in the [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md) article."},{"pos":[742,749],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The first example shows how to raise and consume an event that doesn't have data.","pos":[753,834]},{"content":"It contains a class named <ph id=\"ph1\">`Counter`</ph> that has an event named <ph id=\"ph2\">`ThresholdReached`</ph>.","pos":[835,914],"source":" It contains a class named `Counter` that has an event named `ThresholdReached`."},{"content":"This event is raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value.","pos":[915,993]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler&gt;</ph> delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided.","pos":[994,1098],"source":" The <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided."},{"pos":[1355,1362],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The next example shows how to raise and consume an event that provides data.","pos":[1366,1442]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler%601&gt;</ph> delegate is associated with the event, and an instance of a custom event data object is provided.","pos":[1443,1575],"source":" The <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate is associated with the event, and an instance of a custom event data object is provided."},{"pos":[1955,1962],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The next example shows how to declare a delegate for an event.","pos":[1966,2028]},{"content":"The delegate is named <ph id=\"ph1\">`ThresholdReachedEventHandler`</ph>.","pos":[2029,2082],"source":" The delegate is named `ThresholdReachedEventHandler`."},{"content":"This is just an illustration.","pos":[2083,2112]},{"content":"Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler&gt;</ph> or the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.EventHandler%601&gt;</ph> delegate.","pos":[2113,2281],"source":" Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the <xref:System.EventHandler> or the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate."},{"content":"You should declare a delegate only in rare scenarios, such as making your class available to legacy code that cannot use generics.","pos":[2282,2412]},{"pos":[2681,2689],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2693,2741],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md)"}]}
