The examples in this topic show how you can use generated method wrappers for stored procedures, and how you can call stored procedures directly.  \n  \n If you are using Visual Studio, you can use the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)] to assign stored procedures to perform inserts, updates, and deletes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To read back database-generated values, use output parameters in your stored procedures. If you cannot use output parameters, write a partial method implementation instead of relying on overrides generated by the [!INCLUDE[vs_ordesigner_long](../../../../../../includes/vs-ordesigner-long-md.md)]. Members mapped to database-generated values must be set to appropriate values after `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operations have successfully completed.
