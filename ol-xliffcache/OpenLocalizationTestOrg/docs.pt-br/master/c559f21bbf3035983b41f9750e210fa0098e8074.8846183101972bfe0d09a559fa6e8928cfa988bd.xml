The Settings designer is a grid-style interface that allows you to create new settings and specify properties for those settings. You must specify Name, Value, Type and Scope for your new settings. Once a setting is created, it is accessible in code.  \n  \n### To create a new setting at design time in C#  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Properties** node of your project.  \n  \n2.  Double-click the .settings file in which you want to add a new setting. The default name for this file is Settings.settings.  \n  \n3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.  \n  \n### To create a new setting at design time in Visual Basic  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, right-click your project node and choose **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** page, select the **Settings** tab.  \n  \n3.  In the Settings designer, set the Name, Value, Type, and Scope for your setting. Each row represents a single setting.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using Application Settings and User Settings](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-application-settings-and-user-settings.md)   \n [Application Settings Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/application-settings-overview.md)   \n [How To: Change the Value of an Existing Setting at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-change-the-value-of-an-existing-setting-at-design-time.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,533],"nodes":[{"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]}],"pos":[6,69],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How To: Create a New Setting at Design Time | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
