After deployment, services (and the endpoints they expose) might need to be changed, for example, to satisfy changing business requirements or IT requirements, or to fix issues. Each change introduces a new version of the service.  \n  \n [Load Balancing](../../../docs/framework/wcf/load-balancing.md)  \n Lists guidelines for load balancing with a Web farm.  \n  \n [Controlling Resource Consumption and Improving Performance](../../../docs/framework/wcf/controlling-resource-consumption-and-improving-performance.md)  \n Describes the properties that are designed to help prevent undue resource consumption and improve security and points to more complete information about their use.  \n  \n [Deploying WCF Applications with ClickOnce](../../../docs/framework/wcf/deploying-wcf-applications-with-clickonce.md)  \n Describes the considerations to be made when using the ClickOnce feature.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
