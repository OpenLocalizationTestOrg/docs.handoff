Run the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client for the WSE 3.0 Web service.  \n  \n     For a WSE Web service, a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client class is created.  \n  \n     For details about creating a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client, see the [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).  \n  \n2.  Create a class that represents a binding that can communicate with WSE 3.0 Web services.  \n  \n     The following class is part of the [Interoperating with WSE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f6816861-96a0-45f9-8736-8e4e82cd3a41) sample.  \n  \n    1.  Create a class that derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> class.  \n  \n         The following code example creates a class named `WseHttpBinding` that derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> class.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#1)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#1)]  \n  \n    2.  Add properties to the class that specify the WSE turnkey assertion, whether derived keys are required, whether secure sessions are used, whether signature confirmations are required, and the message protection settings.  \n  \n         The following code example defines `SecurityAssertion,``RequireDerivedKeys, EstablishSecurityContext, MessageProtectionOrder` properties that specify the WSE turnkey assertion, whether derived keys are required, whether secure sessions are used, whether signature confirmations are required, and the message protection settings, respectively.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#3)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#3)]  \n  \n    3.  Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding.CreateBindingElements%2A> method to set the binding properties.  \n  \n         The following code example specifies the transport, message encoding, and message protection settings by getting the values of the `SecurityAssertion` and `MessageProtectionOrder` properties.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#2)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  In the client application code, add code to set the binding properties.  \n  \n     The following code example specifies that the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client must use message protection and authentication as defined by the WSE 3.0 `AnonymousForCertificate` turnkey security assertion. Additionally, secure sessions and derived keys are required.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/client.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/client.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example defines a custom binding that exposes properties that correspond to the properties of a WSE 3.0 turnkey security assertion. The custom binding, which is named `WseHttpBinding`, is then used to specify the binding properties for a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client.  \n  \n
