There are three reasons to group controls. One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To create a group of controls  \n  \n1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control from the **Windows Forms** tab of the Toolbox onto a form.  \n  \n2.  Add other controls to the panel, drawing each inside the panel.  \n  \n     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a panel, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, and then paste them into the panel. You can also drag them into the panel.  \n  \n3.  (Optional) If you want to add a border to a panel, set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle> property. There are three choices: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.Fixed3D>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.None>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Panel Control](panel-control-windows-forms.md)\n- [Panel Control Overview](panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,319],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Panel control [Windows Forms], grouping controls\"\n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], grouping\"\n  - \"Windows Forms controls, grouping\"\nms.assetid: 7e1cd708-fdb1-49d8-9ca2-5640b276bf2e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,78],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,78]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[326,404],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,78]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> controls are used to group other controls.","pos":[405,495],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to group other controls."},{"content":"There are three reasons to group controls.","pos":[496,538]},{"content":"One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.","pos":[539,740]},{"pos":[748,1093],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
