This class wraps the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] objects in a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window, allowing them to be incorporated into your                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] as a child window.  \n  \n The following example shows the code for creating the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object as the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] container window for the visual objects. To set the window style, position, and other parameters for the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window, use the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSourceParameters> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#101](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyWindow.cs#101)]\n [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#101](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyWindow.vb#101)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The value of the                      <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSourceParameters.ExtendedWindowStyle%2A> property cannot be set to WS_EX_TRANSPARENT. This means that the host                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window cannot be transparent. For this reason, the background color of the host                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window is set to the same background color as its parent window.  \n  \n<a name=\"adding_visual_objects_to_the_host_win32_window\"></a>   \n## Adding Visual Objects to the Host Win32 Window  \n Once you have created a host                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] container window for the visual objects, you can add visual objects to it. You will want to ensure that any transformations of the visual objects, such as animations, do not extend beyond the bounds of the host                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window's bounding rectangle.  \n  \n The following example shows the code for creating the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object and adding visual objects to it.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The                      <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.RootVisual%2A> property of the                      <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object is set to the first visual object added to the host                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window. The root visual object defines the top-most node of the visual object tree. Any subsequent visual objects added to the host                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window are added as child objects.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#100](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyWindow.cs#100)]\n [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#100](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyWindow.vb#100)]  \n  \n<a name=\"implementing_the_win32_message_filter\"></a>   \n## Implementing the Win32 Message Filter  \n The host                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window for the visual objects requires a window message filter procedure to handle messages that are sent to the window from the application queue. The window procedure receives messages from the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] system. These may be input messages or window-management messages. You can optionally handle a message in your window procedure or pass the message to the system for default processing.  \n  \n The                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object that you defined as the parent for the visual objects must reference the window message filter procedure you provide. When you create the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> object, set the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSourceParameters.HwndSourceHook%2A> property to reference the window procedure.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#102](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyWindow.cs#102)]\n [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#102](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyWindow.vb#102)]  \n  \n The following example shows the code for handling the left and right mouse button up messages. The coordinate value of the mouse hit position is contained in the value of the                  `lParam` parameter.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[VisualsHitTesting#103](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/CSharp/MyWindow.cs#103)]\n [!code-vb[VisualsHitTesting#103](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/VisualsHitTesting/VisualBasic/MyWindow.vb#103)]  \n  \n<a name=\"processing_the_win32_messages\"></a>   \n## Processing the Win32 Messages  \n The code in the following example shows how a hit test is performed against the hierarchy of visual objects contained in the host                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_win32](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-win32-md.md)] window. You can identify whether a point is within the geometry of a visual object, by using the                  <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualTreeHelper.HitTest%2A> method to specify the root visual object and the coordinate value to hit test against. In this case, the root visual object is the value of the                  <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.RootVisual%2A> property of the
