C# supports several different kinds of statements, a number of which are defined in terms of embedded statements.\n\nA *block* permits multiple statements to be written in contexts where a single statement is allowed. A block consists of a list of statements written between the delimiters `{` and `}`.\n\n*Declaration statements* are used to declare local variables and constants.\n\n*Expression statements* are used to evaluate expressions. Expressions that can be used as statements include method invocations, object allocations using the `new` operator, assignments using `=` and the compound assignment operators, increment and decrement operations using the `++` and `--` operators and `await` expressions.\n\n*Selection statements* are used to select one of a number of possible statements for execution based on the value of some expression. In this group are the `if` and `switch` statements.\n\n*Iteration statements* are used to execute repeatedly an embedded statement. In this group are the `while`, `do`, `for`, and `foreach` statements.\n\n*Jump statements* are used to transfer control. In this group are the `break`, `continue`, `goto`, `throw`, `return`, and `yield` statements.\n\nThe `try`...`catch` statement is used to catch exceptions that occur during execution of a block, and the `try`...`finally` statement is used to specify finalization code that is always executed, whether an exception occurred or not.\n\nThe `checked` and `unchecked` statements are used to control the overflow-checking context for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.\n\nThe `lock` statement is used to obtain the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, execute a statement, and then release the lock.\n\nThe `using` statement is used to obtain a resource, execute a statement, and then dispose of that resource.\n\nThe following lists the kinds of statements that can be used, and provides an example for each.\n\n* Local variable declaration:\n\n [!code-csharp[Declarations](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/statements/Program.cs#L9-L15)]\n\n* Local constant declaration:\n\n
