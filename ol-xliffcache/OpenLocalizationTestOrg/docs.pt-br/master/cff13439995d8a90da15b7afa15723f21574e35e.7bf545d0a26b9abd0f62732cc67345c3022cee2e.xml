WCF analytic tracing events are emitted at key points in the WCF stack to allow troubleshooting of WCF services in a production environment. Analytic tracing for WCF services has minimal impact on the performance of a product server that hosts [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)] WCF services as these events are very efficiently emitted to an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) session.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Analytic Tracing Overview](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-tracing-overview.md)  \n Discusses how WCF analytic tracing works in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n [Dynamically Enabling Analytic Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/dynamically-enabling-analytic-tracing.md)  \n Discusses how to enable or disable tracing dynamically using ETW.  \n  \n [Configuring Message Flow Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/configuring-message-flow-tracing.md)  \n Describes how to configure message flow tracing.  \n  \n [Analytic Trace Event Reference](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/etw/analytic-trace-event-reference.md)  \n Shows a table of event IDs with their event levels, event messages and keywords.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WCF Services and Event Tracing for Windows](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/wcf-services-and-event-tracing-for-windows.md)\n- [Tracking Events into Event Tracing in Windows](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/tracking-events-into-event-tracing-in-windows.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,247],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Analytic Tracing with ETW\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
