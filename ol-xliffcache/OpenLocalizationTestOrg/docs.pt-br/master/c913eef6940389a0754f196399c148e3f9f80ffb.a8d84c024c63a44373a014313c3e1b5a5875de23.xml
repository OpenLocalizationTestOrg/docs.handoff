Whereas the <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection.Remove%2A> method deletes a **DataRow** from the **DataRowCollection**, the <xref:System.Data.DataRow.Delete%2A> method only marks the row for deletion. The actual removal occurs when the application calls the **AcceptChanges** method. By using <xref:System.Data.DataRow.Delete%2A>, you can programmatically check which rows are marked for deletion before actually removing them. When a row is marked for deletion, its <xref:System.Data.DataRow.RowState%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Data.DataRow.Delete%2A>.  \n  \n Neither <xref:System.Data.DataRow.Delete%2A> nor <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection.Remove%2A> should be called in a foreach loop while iterating through a <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection> object. <xref:System.Data.DataRow.Delete%2A> nor <xref:System.Data.DataRowCollection.Remove%2A> modify the state of the collection.  \n  \n When using a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or **DataTable** in conjunction with a **DataAdapter** and a relational data source, use the **Delete** method of the **DataRow** to remove the row. The **Delete** method marks the row as **Deleted** in the **DataSet** or **DataTable** but does not remove it. Instead, when the **DataAdapter** encounters a row marked as **Deleted**, it executes its **DeleteCommand** method to delete the row at the data source. The row can then be permanently removed using the **AcceptChanges** method. If you use **Remove** to delete the row, the row is removed entirely from the table, but the **DataAdapter** will not delete the row at the data source.  \n  \n The **Remove** method of the **DataRowCollection** takes a **DataRow** as an argument and removes it from the collection, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nworkTable.Rows.Remove(workRow)  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nworkTable.Rows.Remove(workRow);  \n```  \n  \n In contrast, the following example demonstrates how to call the **Delete** method on a **DataRow** to change its **RowState** to **Deleted**.  \n  \n```vb  \nworkRow.Delete  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nworkRow.Delete();  \n```  \n  \n If a row is marked for deletion and you call the **AcceptChanges** method of the **DataTable** object, the row is removed from the **DataTable**. In contrast, if you call **RejectChanges**, the **RowState** of the row reverts to what it was before being marked as **Deleted**.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If the **RowState** of a **DataRow** is **Added**, meaning it has just been added to the table, and it is then marked as **Deleted**, it is removed from the table.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Data.DataRow>   \n
