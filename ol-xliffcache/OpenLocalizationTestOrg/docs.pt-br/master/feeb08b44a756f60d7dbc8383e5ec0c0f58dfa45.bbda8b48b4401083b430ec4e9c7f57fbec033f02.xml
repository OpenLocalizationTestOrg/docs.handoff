For more information, see [Binding Data to Controls](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/binding-data-to-controls-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example is from the code-behind page for an Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) page that defines the `SalesOrders` window in WPF. When the window is loaded, a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601> is created based on the result of a query that returns customers, filtered by country. All of the pages of this paged result are loaded, along with the related orders, and are bound to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.DataContext%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> that is the root layout control for the WPF window.
