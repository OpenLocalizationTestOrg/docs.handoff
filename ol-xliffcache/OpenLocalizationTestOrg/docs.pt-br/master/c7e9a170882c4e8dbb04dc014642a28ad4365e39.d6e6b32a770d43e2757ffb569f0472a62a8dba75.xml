These examples do not provide a progress bar or any other user interface. If you want to provide a standard progress dialog box, see [How to: Provide a Progress Dialog Box for File Operations](how-to-provide-a-progress-dialog-box-for-file-operations.md).  \n  \n Use <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher?displayProperty=fullName> to provide events that will enable you to calculate the progress when operating on multiple files. Another approach is to use platform invoke to call the relevant file-related methods in the Windows Shell. For information about how to perform these file operations asynchronously, see [Asynchronous File I/O](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/kztecsys).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows
