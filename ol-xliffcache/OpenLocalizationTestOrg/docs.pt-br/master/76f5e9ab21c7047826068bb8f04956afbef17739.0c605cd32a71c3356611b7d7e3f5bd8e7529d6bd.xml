This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the `ServerAuthentication` object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] does not enforce such a constraint. If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to access the service metadata.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md)   \n [How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,113],"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,101]}]},{"pos":[533,617],"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","linkify":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","nodes":[{"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","pos":[0,84]}]},{"content":"Because of difference between the way Internet Explorer and <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> validate service certificates when HTTPS is used, it is possible that Internet Explorer will not be able to access the Help page or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) of a service even though a <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> client is able to successfully send messages to the service endpoints.","pos":[618,1060],"source":"Because of difference between the way Internet Explorer and [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] validate service certificates when HTTPS is used, it is possible that Internet Explorer will not be able to access the Help page or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) of a service even though a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client is able to successfully send messages to the service endpoints."},{"content":"This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServerAuthentication`</ph> object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> does not enforce such a constraint.","pos":[1061,1318],"source":" This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the `ServerAuthentication` object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] does not enforce such a constraint."},{"content":"If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md)</ept> to access the service metadata.","pos":[1319,1583],"source":" If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to access the service metadata."},{"pos":[1592,1600],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1604,1781],"source":"[Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)</ept>","pos":[1784,1956],"source":" [How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)"}]}
