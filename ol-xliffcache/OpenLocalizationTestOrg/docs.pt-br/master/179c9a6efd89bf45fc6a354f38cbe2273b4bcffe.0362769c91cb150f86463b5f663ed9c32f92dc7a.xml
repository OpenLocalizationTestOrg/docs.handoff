This means both of the operands and the return value must be of the type of the counter variable.  \n  \n If you use a numeric data type for the counter variable, the `+` and `-` operators are supported on the containing type. If you use a user-defined class or structure, you must define both operators with operands and return value of the type of your class or structure.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33039  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Make sure the spelling of the counter-variable data type is correct.  \n  \n2.  If you are using a user-defined class or structure for the counter variable, define `+` and `-` operators that operate completely on that class or structure.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,256],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Return and parameter types of '<operator>' must be '<typename>' to be used in a 'For' statement\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
