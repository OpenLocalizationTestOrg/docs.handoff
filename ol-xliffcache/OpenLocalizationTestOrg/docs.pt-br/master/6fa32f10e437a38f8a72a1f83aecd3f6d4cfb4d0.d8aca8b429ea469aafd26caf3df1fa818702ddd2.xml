For more information, see [Batching Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/batching-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.ExecuteBatch%2A> method to execute an array of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest%601> objects that contains queries that return both `Customers` and `Products` objects from the Northwind data service. The collection of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> objects in the returned <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceResponse> is enumerated, and the collection of objects contained in each <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> is also enumerated.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#BatchQuery](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#batchquery)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#BatchQuery](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#batchquery)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WCF Data Services Client Library](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,440],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework-oob\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
