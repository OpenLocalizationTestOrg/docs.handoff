You assign an object to such a variable by placing the object after the equal sign (`=`) in an assignment statement or initialization clause.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example declares an `Object` variable and assigns the current instance to it.  \n  \n```  \n      Dim thisObject As Object  \nthisObject = \"This is an Object\"  \n```  \n  \n You can combine the declaration and assignment by initializing the variable as part of its declaration. The following example is equivalent to the preceding example.  \n  \n```  \nDim thisObject As Object= \"This is an Object\"  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A reference to the <xref:System> namespace.  \n  \n-   A class, structure, or module in which to put the `Dim` statement.  \n  \n-   A procedure in which to put the assignment statement.  \n  \n## See
