demonstrate custom channels.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Local Channel](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/local-channel.md)  \n Demonstrates the local channel, a WCF transport channel that is used for communication within the same application domain.  \n  \n [Reliable Secure Profile](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/reliable-secure-profile.md)  \n Demonstrates how to compose WCF and Reliable Secure Profile (RSP).  \n  \n [Custom Channel Dispatcher](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-channel-dispatcher.md)  \n Demonstrates how to build the channel stack in a custom way by implementing <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHostBase> directly and how to create a custom channel dispatcher in Web host environment.  \n  \n [Chunking Channel](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/chunking-channel.md)  \n Demonstrates how to limit the amount of memory used to buffer large messages sent using WCF.\n  \n [HttpCookieSession](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/httpcookiesession.md)  \n Demonstrates how to build a custom protocol channel to use HTTP cookies for session management.  \n  \n [Custom Message Interceptor](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-message-interceptor.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a custom binding element that creates channel factories and channel listeners to intercept all incoming and outgoing messages at a particular point in the run-time stack.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,106],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Channels
