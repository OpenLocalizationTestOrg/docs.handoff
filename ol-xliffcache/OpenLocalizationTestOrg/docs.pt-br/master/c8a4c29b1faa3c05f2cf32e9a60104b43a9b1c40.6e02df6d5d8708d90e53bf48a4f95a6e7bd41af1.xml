A remote method call is one that [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates to SQL and transmits to the database engine for execution. Local method calls are needed when [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] cannot translate the call into SQL. Otherwise, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown.  \n  \n## Example 1  \n In the following example, an `Order` class is mapped to the Orders table in the Northwind sample database. A local instance method has been added to the class.  \n  \n In Query 1, the constructor for the `Order` class is executed locally. In Query 2, if [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] tried to translate `LocalInstanceMethod()`into SQL, the attempt would fail and an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception would be thrown. But because [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] provides support for local method calls, Query2 will not throw an exception.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DlinqLocalMethodCall#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqLocalMethodCall/cs/Program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DlinqLocalMethodCall#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqLocalMethodCall/vb/Module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DlinqLocalMethodCall#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqLocalMethodCall/cs/northwind.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[DlinqLocalMethodCall#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqLocalMethodCall/vb/northwind.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Background Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,136],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Local Method Calls\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: c34b5012-aee9-4994-9364-1d99d12b7463","nodes":[{"content":"Local Method Calls","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"Local Method Calls","nodes":[{"content":"Local Method Calls","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[143,161],"content":"Local Method Calls","linkify":"Local Method Calls","nodes":[{"content":"Local Method Calls","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"A local method call is one that is executed within the object model.","pos":[162,230]},{"content":"A remote method call is one that <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> translates to SQL and transmits to the database engine for execution.","pos":[231,401],"source":" A remote method call is one that [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates to SQL and transmits to the database engine for execution."},{"content":"Local method calls are needed when <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> cannot translate the call into SQL.","pos":[402,540],"source":" Local method calls are needed when [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] cannot translate the call into SQL."},{"content":"Otherwise, an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.InvalidOperationException&gt;</ph> is thrown.","pos":[541,605],"source":" Otherwise, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown."},{"pos":[614,623],"content":"Example 1","linkify":"Example 1","nodes":[{"content":"Example 1","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"In the following example, an <ph id=\"ph1\">`Order`</ph> class is mapped to the Orders table in the Northwind sample database.","pos":[627,733],"source":"In the following example, an `Order` class is mapped to the Orders table in the Northwind sample database."},{"content":"A local instance method has been added to the class.","pos":[734,786]},{"content":"In Query 1, the constructor for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Order`</ph> class is executed locally.","pos":[793,863],"source":"In Query 1, the constructor for the `Order` class is executed locally."},{"content":"In Query 2, if <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> tried to translate <ph id=\"ph2\">`LocalInstanceMethod()`</ph>into SQL, the attempt would fail and an <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.InvalidOperationException&gt;</ph> exception would be thrown.","pos":[864,1095],"source":" In Query 2, if [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] tried to translate `LocalInstanceMethod()`into SQL, the attempt would fail and an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> exception would be thrown."},{"content":"But because <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> provides support for local method calls, Query2 will not throw an exception.","pos":[1096,1252],"source":" But because [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] provides support for local method calls, Query2 will not throw an exception."},{"pos":[1825,1833],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1837,1942],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Background Information<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)</ept>","source":"[Background Information](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/background-information.md)"}]}
