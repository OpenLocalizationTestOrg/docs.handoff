The task represents ongoing work.  \n  \n The asynchronous method in which `await` is used must be modified by the [async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) keyword. Such a method, defined by using the `async` modifier, and usually containing one or more `await` expressions, is referred to as an *async method*.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced in Visual Studio 2012. For an introduction to async programming, see [Asynchronous Programming with async and await](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md).  \n  \n The task to which the `await` operator is applied typically is the return value from a call to a method that implements the [Task-Based Asynchronous Pattern](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=204847). Examples include values of type <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>.  \n  \n In the following code, the <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient> method <xref:System.Net.Http.HttpClient.GetByteArrayAsync%2A> returns a `Task\\<byte[]>`, `getContentsTask`. The task is a promise to produce the actual byte array when the task is complete. The `await` operator is applied to `getContentsTask` to suspend execution in `SumPageSizesAsync` until `getContentsTask` is complete. In the meantime, control is returned to the caller of `SumPageSizesAsync`. When `getContentsTask` is finished, the `await` expression evaluates to a byte array.  \n  \n```csharp  \n  \nprivate async Task SumPageSizesAsync()  \n{  \n    // To use the HttpClient type in desktop apps, you must include a using directive and add a   \n    // reference for the System.Net.Http namespace.  \n    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();  \n    // . . .  \n    Task<byte[]> getContentsTask = client.GetByteArrayAsync(url);  \n    byte[] urlContents = await getContentsTask;  \n  \n    // Equivalently, now that you see how it works, you can write the same thing in a single line.  \n    //byte[] urlContents = await client.GetByteArrayAsync(url);  \n    // . . .  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  For the complete example, see [Walkthrough: Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md). You can download the sample from [Developer Code Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=255191&clcid=0x409) on the Microsoft website. The example is in the AsyncWalkthrough_HttpClient project.  \n  \n As shown in the previous example, if `await` is applied to the result of a method call that returns a `Task<TResult>`, then the type of the `await` expression is TResult. If `await` is applied to the result of a method call that returns a `Task`, then the type of the `await` expression is void. The following example illustrates the difference.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Keyword await used with a method that returns a Task<TResult>.  \nTResult result = await AsyncMethodThatReturnsTaskTResult();  \n  \n// Keyword await used with a method that returns a Task.  \nawait AsyncMethodThatReturnsTask();  \n  \n```  \n  \n An `await` expression does not block the thread on which it is executing. Instead, it causes the compiler to sign up the rest of the async method as a continuation on the awaited task. Control then returns to the caller of the async method. When the task completes, it invokes its continuation, and execution of the async method resumes where it left off.  \n  \n An `await` expression can occur only in the body of an immediately enclosing method, lambda expression, or anonymous method that is marked by an `async` modifier. The term *await* serves as a keyword only in that context. Elsewhere, it is interpreted as an identifier. Within the method, lambda expression, or anonymous method, an `await` expression cannot occur in the body of a synchronous function, in a query expression,, in the block of a [lock statement](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/lock-statement.md), or in an [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) context.  \n  \n## Exceptions  \n Most async methods return a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task> or <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601>. The properties of the returned task carry information about its status and history, such as whether the task is complete, whether the async method caused an exception or was canceled, and what the final result is. The `await` operator accesses those properties.  \n  \n If you await a task-returning async method that causes an exception, the  `await` operator rethrows the exception.  \n  \n If you await a task-returning async method that's canceled, the `await` operator rethrows an <xref:System.OperationCanceledException>.  \n  \n A single task that is in a faulted state can reflect multiple exceptions. For example, the task might be the result of a call to <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WhenAll%2A?displayProperty=fullName>. When you await such a task, the await operation rethrows only one of the exceptions. However, you can't predict which of the exceptions is rethrown.  \n  \n For examples of error handling in async methods, see [try-catch](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Windows Forms example illustrates the use of `await` in an async method, `WaitAsynchronouslyAsync`. Contrast the behavior of that method with the behavior of `WaitSynchronously`. Without an `await` operator applied to a task, `WaitSynchronously` runs synchronously despite the use of the `async` modifier in its definition and a call to <xref:System.Threading.Thread.Sleep%2A?displayProperty=fullName> in its body.  \n  \n```csharp  \n  \nprivate async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)  \n{  \n    // Call the method that runs asynchronously.  \n    string result = await WaitAsynchronouslyAsync();  \n  \n    // Call the method that runs synchronously.  \n    //string result = await WaitSynchronously ();  \n  \n    // Display the result.  \n    textBox1.Text += result;  \n}  \n  \n// The following method runs asynchronously. The UI thread is not  \n// blocked during the delay. You can move or resize the Form1 window   \n// while Task.Delay is running.  \npublic async Task<string> WaitAsynchronouslyAsync()  \n{  \n    await Task.Delay(10000);  \n    return \"Finished\";  \n}  \n  \n// The following method runs synchronously, despite the use of async.  \n// You cannot move or resize the Form1 window while Thread.Sleep  \n// is running because the UI thread is blocked.  \npublic async Task<string> WaitSynchronously()  \n{  \n    // Add a using directive for System.Threading.  \n    Thread.Sleep(10000);  \n    return \"Finished\";  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Asynchronous Programming with async and await](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/index.md)   \n [Walkthrough: Accessing the Web by Using Async and Await](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/walkthrough-accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await.md)   \n [async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,49],"content":"await (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"await (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]},{"pos":[576,596],"content":"await (C# Reference)","linkify":"await (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"await (C# Reference)","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`await`</ph> operator is applied to a task in an asynchronous method to suspend the execution of the method until the awaited task completes.","pos":[597,737],"source":"The `await` operator is applied to a task in an asynchronous method to suspend the execution of the method until the awaited task completes."},{"content":"The task represents ongoing work.","pos":[738,771]},{"content":"The asynchronous method in which <ph id=\"ph1\">`await`</ph> is used must be modified by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>async<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md)</ept> keyword.","pos":[778,921],"source":"The asynchronous method in which `await` is used must be modified by the [async](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/async.md) keyword."},{"content":"Such a method, defined by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`async`</ph> modifier, and usually containing one or more <ph id=\"ph2\">`await`</ph> expressions, is referred to as an <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>async method<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[922,1068],"source":" Such a method, defined by using the `async` modifier, and usually containing one or more `await` expressions, is referred to as an *async method*."},{"pos":[1076,1312],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced in Visual Studio 2012.
