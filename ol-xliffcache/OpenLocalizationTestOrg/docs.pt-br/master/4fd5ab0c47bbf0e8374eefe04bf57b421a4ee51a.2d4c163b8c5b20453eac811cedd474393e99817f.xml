The following table describes `DataTable` events.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.Initialized>|Occurs after the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.EndInit%2A> method of a `DataTable` is called. This event is intended primarily to support design-time scenarios.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.ColumnChanged>|Occurs after a value has been successfully changed in a <xref:System.Data.DataColumn>.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.ColumnChanging>|Occurs when a value has been submitted for a `DataColumn`.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.RowChanged>|Occurs after a `DataColumn` value or the <xref:System.Data.DataRow.RowState%2A> of a <xref:System.Data.DataRow> in the `DataTable` has been changed successfully.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.RowChanging>|Occurs when a change has been submitted for a `DataColumn` value or the `RowState` of a `DataRow` in the `DataTable`.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.RowDeleted>|Occurs after a `DataRow` in the `DataTable` has been marked as `Deleted`.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.RowDeleting>|Occurs before a `DataRow` in the `DataTable` is marked as `Deleted`.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.TableCleared>|Occurs after a call to the <xref:System.Data.DataTable.Clear%2A> method of the `DataTable` has successfully cleared every `DataRow`.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.TableClearing>|Occurs after the `Clear` method is called but before the `Clear` operation begins.|  \n|<xref:System.Data.DataTable.TableNewRow>|Occurs after a new `DataRow` is created by a call to the `NewRow` method of the `DataTable`.|  \n|<xref:System.ComponentModel.MarshalByValueComponent.Disposed>|Occurs when the `DataTable` is `Disposed`. Inherited from <xref:System.ComponentModel.MarshalByValueComponent>.|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Most operations that add or delete rows do not raise the `ColumnChanged` and `ColumnChanging` events. However, the `ReadXml` method does raise `ColumnChanged` and `ColumnChanging` events, unless the `XmlReadMode` is set to `DiffGram` or is set to `Auto` when the XML document being read is a `DiffGram`.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  Data corruption can occur if data is modified in a `DataSet` from which the `RowChanged` event is raised. No exception will be raised if such data corruption occurs.  \n  \n## Additional Related Events  \n The <xref:System.Data.DataTable.Constraints%2A> property holds a <xref:System.Data.ConstraintCollection> instance. The <xref:System.Data.ConstraintCollection> class exposes a <xref:System.Data.ConstraintCollection.CollectionChanged> event. This event fires when a constraint is added, modified, or removed from the `ConstraintCollection`.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.DataTable.Columns%2A> property holds a <xref:System.Data.DataColumnCollection> instance. The `DataColumnCollection` class exposes a <xref:System.Data.DataColumnCollection.CollectionChanged> event. This event fires when a `DataColumn` is added, modified, or removed from the `DataColumnCollection`. Modifications that cause the event to fire include changes to the name, type, expression or ordinal position of a column.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.DataSet.Tables%2A> property of a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> holds a <xref:System.Data.DataTableCollection> instance. The `DataTableCollection` class exposes both a `CollectionChanged` and a `CollectionChanging` event. These events fire when a `DataTable` is added to or removed from the `DataSet`.  \n  \n Changes to `DataRows` can also trigger events for an associated <xref:System.Data.DataView>. The `DataView` class exposes a <xref:System.Data.DataView.ListChanged> event that fires when a `DataColumn` value changes or when the composition or sort order of the view changes. The <xref:System.Data.DataRowView> class exposes a <xref:System.Data.DataRowView.PropertyChanged> event that fires when an associated `DataColumn` value changes.  \n  \n## Sequence of Operations  \n Here is the sequence of operations that occur when a `DataRow` is added, modified, or deleted:  \n  \n1.  Create the proposed record and apply any changes.  \n  \n2.  Check constraints for non-expression columns.  \n  \n3.  Raise the `RowChanging` or `RowDeleting` events as applicable.  \n  \n4.  Set the proposed record to be the current record.  \n  \n5.  Update any associated indexes.  \n  \n6.  Raise `ListChanged` events for associated `DataView` objects and `PropertyChanged` events for associated `DataRowView` objects.  \n  \n7.  Evaluate all expression columns, but delay checking any constraints on these columns.  \n  \n8.  Raise `ListChanged` events for associated `DataView` objects and `PropertyChanged` events for associated `DataRowView` objects affected by the expression column evaluations.  \n  \n9. Raise `RowChanged` or `RowDeleted` events as applicable.  \n  \n10. Check constraints on expression columns.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Changes to expression columns never raise `DataTable` events. Changes to expression columns only raise `DataView` and `DataRowView` events. Expression columns can have dependencies on multiple other columns, and can be evaluated multiple times during a single `DataRow` operation. Each expression evaluation raises events, and a single `DataRow` operation can raise multiple `ListChanged` and `PropertyChanged` events when expression columns are affected, possibly including multiple events for the same expression column.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  Do not throw a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> within the `RowChanged` event handler. If a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> is thrown within the `RowChanged` event of a `DataTable`, then the `DataTable` will be corrupted.  \n  \n### Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to create event handlers for the `RowChanged`, `RowChanging`, `RowDeleted`, `RowDeleting`, `ColumnChanged`, `ColumnChanging`, `TableNewRow`, `TableCleared`, and `TableClearing` events. Each event handler displays output in the console window when it is fired.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DataWorks DataTable.Events#1](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_ADO.NET/DataWorks
