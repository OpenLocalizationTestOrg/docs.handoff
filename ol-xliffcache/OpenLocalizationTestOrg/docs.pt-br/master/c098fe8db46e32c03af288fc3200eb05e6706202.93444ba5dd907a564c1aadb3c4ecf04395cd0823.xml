'method' not found.  \n  \nIn order to query a source type, that type must implement the standard query operator methods that you are invoking in the query. The implementation can be either in the form of class members or extension methods that are brought into scope with the appropriate `using` directive.  \n\n## To correct this error\n\n- Make sure that you are querying a collection of objects, not an individual object.  \n  \n- Make sure that you have specified the necessary `using` directives.  \n\n## Example\n\nThe following example produces CS1936:  \n\n```csharp\n// cs1936.cs  \nusing System.Collections;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    static int Main()  \n    {  \n        object obj;  \n        IEnumerable e = from x in obj // CS1936  \n                        select x;  \n        return 0;  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you accidentally try to query an object of some type instead of a collection of those objects.  \n\n## See also\n\n- [Standard Query Operators Overview](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-expression-syntax-for-standard-query-operators.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1936\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1936\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1936\"\nms.assetid: 980161b5-5bd7-4cb5-8b66-9bcbb062a8e6","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1936","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1936","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1936","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1936","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1936","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1936","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Could not find an implementation of the query pattern for source type 'type'.","pos":[195,272]},{"content":"'method' not found.","pos":[274,293]},{"content":"In order to query a source type, that type must implement the standard query operator methods that you are invoking in the query.","pos":[299,428]},{"content":"The implementation can be either in the form of class members or extension methods that are brought into scope with the appropriate <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directive.","pos":[429,579],"source":" The implementation can be either in the form of class members or extension methods that are brought into scope with the appropriate `using` directive."},{"pos":[586,607],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Make sure that you are querying a collection of objects, not an individual object.","pos":[611,693]},{"pos":[701,768],"content":"Make sure that you have specified the necessary <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> directives.","source":"Make sure that you have specified the necessary `using` directives."},{"pos":[775,782],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example produces CS1936:","pos":[784,822]},{"content":"This error typically occurs when you accidentally try to query an object of some type instead of a collection of those objects.","pos":[1094,1221]},{"pos":[1228,1236],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1240,1370],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Standard Query Operators Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-expression-syntax-for-standard-query-operators.md)</ept>","source":"[Standard Query Operators Overview](../../programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-expression-syntax-for-standard-query-operators.md)"}]}
