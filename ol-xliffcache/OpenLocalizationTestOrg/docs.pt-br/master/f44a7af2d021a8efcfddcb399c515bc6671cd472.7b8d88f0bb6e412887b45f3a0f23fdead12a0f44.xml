It is often used in conjunction with *code refactoring*, by which you split an assembly into two or more assemblies or move code from one assembly to another.  \n  \n Forwarding a type to itself results in circular forwarding. If another assembly attempted to access the forwarded type, it would go through endless forwarding without ever arriving at a type that had not been forwarded.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31425  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Forward the type to a type in a different assembly, or do not forward it at all.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TypeForwardedToAttribute>   \n [Type Forwarding (C++/CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/type-forwarding-cpp-cli)   \n [Managing references in a project](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/managing-references-in-a-project)   \n [NIB How to: Add or Remove References By Using the Add Reference Dialog Box](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3bd75d61-f00c-47c0-86a2-dd1f20e231c9)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,688],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"&#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39;
