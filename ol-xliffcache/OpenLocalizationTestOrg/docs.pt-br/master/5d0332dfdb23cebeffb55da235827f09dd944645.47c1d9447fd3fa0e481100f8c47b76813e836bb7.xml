The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> infers a data contract for all public unmarked types that have a default constructor. Data contracts allow you to pass structured data to and from services. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] unmarked types, see [Serializable Types](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/serializable-types.md).  \n  \n This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md), but uses complex numbers instead of primitive numeric types. It is also similar to the [Basic Data Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-data-contract.md) sample, except that the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes are not used.  \n  \n The service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS) and the client is a console application (.exe).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The `ComplexNumber` class is used in the `ServiceContract`. The `ComplexNumber` type does not have the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attributes, as shown in the following sample code. By default, all public properties and fields are serialized.  \n  \n```  \npublic class ComplexNumber  \n{  \n    public double Real;  \n    public double Imaginary;  \n    public ComplexNumber()  \n    {  \n        Real = double.MinValue;  \n        Imaginary = double.MinValue;  \n    }  \n    public ComplexNumber(double real, double imaginary)  \n    {  \n        this.Real = real;  \n        this.Imaginary = imaginary;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
