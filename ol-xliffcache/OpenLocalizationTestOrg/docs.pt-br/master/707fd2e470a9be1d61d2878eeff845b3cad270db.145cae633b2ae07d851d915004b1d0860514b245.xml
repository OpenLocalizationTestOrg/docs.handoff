In this configuration, you may find it useful to stretch an item in the control, such as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripTextBox>, to fill the available space and to resize when the control resizes. This stretching is useful, for example, if you want to achieve appearance and behavior similar to the address bar in Microsoft® Internet Explorer.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example provides a class derived from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripTextBox> called `ToolStripSpringTextBox`. This class overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripTextBox.GetPreferredSize%2A> method to calculate the available width of the parent <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control after the combined width of all other items has been subtracted. This code example also provides a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> class and a `Program` class to demonstrate the new behavior.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ToolStripSpringTextBox#00](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ToolStripSpringTextBox/cs/ToolStripSpringTextBox.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[ToolStripSpringTextBox#00](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/ToolStripSpringTextBox/vb/ToolStripSpringTextBox.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.Stretch%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripTextBox>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripTextBox.GetPreferredSize%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [ToolStrip Control Architecture](toolstrip-control-architecture.md)\n- [How to: Use the Spring Property Interactively in a StatusStrip](how-to-use-the-spring-property-interactively-in-a-statusstrip.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,378],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Stretch a ToolStripTextBox to Fill the Remaining Width of a ToolStrip (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
