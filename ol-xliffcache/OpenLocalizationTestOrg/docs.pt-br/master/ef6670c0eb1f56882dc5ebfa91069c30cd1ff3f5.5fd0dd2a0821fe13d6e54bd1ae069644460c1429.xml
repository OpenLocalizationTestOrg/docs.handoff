Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] and on the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.  \n  \n2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, select either **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** from the **Installed Templates** pane on the left side of the box. If the language of your choice does not appear, look under **Other Languages**.  \n  \n3.  Select **Windows** in the **Installed Templates** pane.  \n  \n4.  In the top pane, confirm that (the default value) **.NET Framework 4** has been selected in the drop-down list box, and then select **WPF Application**.  \n  \n5.  Set the name of the project to **HostingApplication** at the bottom of the window.  \n  \n6.  Set the solution name to **RehostingTheDesigner**.  \n  \n7.  Click **OK** to create the application project. [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] creates a basic WPF UI for your application and includes the appropriate XAML and code-behind files.  \n  \n8.  Add references to **WorkflowModel** assemblies. To do this, in **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **HostingApplication** project and select **Add Reference**.  \n  \n9. In the **Add Reference** dialog box, click the **.NET** tab, hold down the CTRL key, select the following assemblies, and then click **OK**:  \n  \n    -   System.Activities  \n  \n    -   System.Activities.Presentation  \n  \n    -   System.Activities.Core.Presentation  \n  \n10.
