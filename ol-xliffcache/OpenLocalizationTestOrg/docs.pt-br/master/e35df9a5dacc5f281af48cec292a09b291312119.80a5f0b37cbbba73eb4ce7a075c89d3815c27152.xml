You can create security binding elements for these authentication modes by using static methods on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class or through configuration, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n For more information about the 18 authentication modes, see [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows methods for creating bindings for the various authentication modes.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Once an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> object is created, a number of properties are immutable, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.IssuedSecurityTokenParameters.KeyType%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.MessageSecurityVersion%2A>. Calling `set` on such properties does not change them.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_CustomBindingsAuthMode#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombindingsauthmode/cs/source.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[c_CustomBindingsAuthMode#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_custombindingsauthmode/vb/source.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md)\n- [How to: Create a Custom Binding Using the SecurityBindingElement](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-custom-binding-using-the-securitybindingelement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,193],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: a7c7747a-5b8c-463f-8493-7266dac75066","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","nodes":[{"pos":[0,75],"content":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","pos":[0,75]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[200,275],"content":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","linkify":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a SecurityBindingElement for a Specified Authentication Mode","pos":[0,75]}]},{"content":"Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) provides several modes by which clients and services authenticate to one another.","pos":[276,396]},{"content":"You can create security binding elements for these authentication modes by using static methods on the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement&gt;</ph> class or through configuration, as shown in the following example.","pos":[397,625],"source":" You can create security binding elements for these authentication modes by using static methods on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> class or through configuration, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[632,833],"content":"For more information about the 18 authentication modes, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information about the 18 authentication modes, see [SecurityBindingElement Authentication Modes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securitybindingelement-authentication-modes.md)."},{"pos":[842,849],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example shows methods for creating bindings for the various authentication modes.","pos":[853,953]},{"pos":[961,1348],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Once an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement> object is created, a number of properties are immutable, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.IssuedSecurityTokenParameters.KeyType%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.SecurityBindingElement.MessageSecurityVersion%2A>.
