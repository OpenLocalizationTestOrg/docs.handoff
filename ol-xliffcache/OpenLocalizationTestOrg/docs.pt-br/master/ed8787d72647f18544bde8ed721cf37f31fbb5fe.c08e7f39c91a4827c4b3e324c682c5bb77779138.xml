This topic walks you through building a simple console application using Visual Studio for Mac and .NET Core.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Visual Studio for Mac is preview software. As with all preview versions of Microsoft products, your feedback is highly valued. There are a two ways you can provide feedback to the development team on Visual Studio for Mac:\n> * In Visual Studio for Mac, select **Help > Report a Problem** from the menu or **Report a Problem** from the Welcome screen, which will open a window for filing a bug report.\n> * To make a suggestion, select **Help > Provide a Suggestion** from the menu or **Provide a Suggestion** from the Welcome screen, which will take you to the [Visual Studio for Mac UserVoice webpage](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/563332-visual-studio-for-mac).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n[.NET Core and OpenSSL](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos)\n\nFor more information on prerequisites, see the [Prerequisites for .NET Core on Mac](../../core/macos-prerequisites.md).\n\n## Getting started\n\nIf you've already installed the prerequisites and Visual Studio for Mac, skip this section and proceed to [Creating a project](#creating-a-project). Follow these steps to install the prerequisites and Visual Studio for Mac:\n\n1. Download and install [.NET Core and OpenSSL](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).\n\n1. Download the [Visual Studio for Mac installer](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/). Run the installer. Read and accept the license agreement. During the install, you're provided the opportunity to install Xamarin, a cross-platform mobile app development technology. Installing Xamarin and its related components is optional for .NET Core development. For a walk-through of the Visual Studio for Mac install process, see [Introducing Visual Studio for Mac](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/visual-studio-mac/). When the install is complete, start the Visual Studio for Mac IDE.\n\n## Creating a project\n\n1. Select **New Project** on the Welcome screen.\n\n   ![New project button on the Visual Studio for Mac Welcome screen](./media/using-on-mac-vs/vsmac1.png)\n\n1. In the **New Project** dialog, select **App** under the **.NET Core** node. Select the **Console Application** template followed by **Next**.\n\n   ![New project templates list](./media/using-on-mac-vs/vsmac2.png)\n\n1. Type \"HelloWorld\" for the **Project Name**. Select **Create**.\n\n   ![Configure your new Console Application dialog](./media/using-on-mac-vs/vsmac3.png)\n\n1. Wait while the project's dependencies are restored. The project has a single C# file, *Program.cs*, containing a `Program` class with a `Main` method. The `Console.WriteLine` statement will output \"Hello World!\" to the console when the app is run.\n\n   ![Main window with the Program.cs file open](./media/using-on-mac-vs/vsmac4.png)\n\n## Run the application\n\nRun the app in Debug mode using <kbd>F5</kbd> or in Release mode using <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>.\n\n![The Application Output pane shows Hello World!](./media/using-on-mac-vs/vsmac5.png)\n\n## Next step\n\nThe [Building a complete .NET Core solution on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac](using-on-mac-vs-full-solution.md) topic shows you how to build a complete .NET Core solution that includes a reusable library and unit testing.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,95],"content":"Getting started with .NET Core on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Getting started with .NET Core on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,84]}]},{"pos":[109,218],"content":"This topic walks you through building a simple console application using Visual Studio for Mac and .NET Core.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"This topic walks you through building a simple console application using Visual Studio for Mac and .NET Core.","pos":[0,109]}]},{"pos":[229,256],"content":".NET, .NET Core, macOS, Mac","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, macOS, Mac","pos":[0,27]}]},{"pos":[424,491],"content":"Getting started with .NET Core on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac","linkify":"Getting started with .NET Core on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac","nodes":[{"content":"Getting started with .NET Core on macOS using Visual Studio for Mac","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Visual Studio for Mac provides a full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing .NET Core applications.","pos":[493,619]},{"content":"This topic walks you through building a simple console application using Visual Studio for Mac and .NET Core.","pos":[620,729]},{"pos":[733,965],"content":"[!NOTE]\nVisual Studio for Mac is preview software.
