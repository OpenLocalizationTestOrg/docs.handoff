You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31043  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).  \n  \n2.  If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Structure demoStruct  \n        Public demoArray() As Integer  \n    End Structure  \n    Sub useStruct()  \n        Dim struct As demoStruct  \n        ReDim struct.demoArray(9)  \n        Struct.demoArray(2) = 777  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)   \n [How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,622],"nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,93],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,93]}]}],"pos":[6,102],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31043\"\n  - \"bc31043\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31043\"\nms.assetid: 5bd90c71-1b78-444b-91e1-4789451ef085\ncaps.latest.revision: 11\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[629,705],"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","linkify":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","nodes":[{"content":"Arrays declared as structure members cannot be declared with an initial size","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"An array in a structure is declared with an initial size.","pos":[706,763]},{"content":"You cannot initialize any structure element, and declaring an array size is one form of initialization.","pos":[764,867]},{"pos":[874,895],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31043","source":"**Error ID:** BC31043"},{"pos":[904,925],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Define the array in your structure as dynamic (no initial size).","pos":[935,999]},{"content":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ReDim Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)</ept> when your code is running.","pos":[1009,1208],"source":"If you require a certain size of array, you can redimension a dynamic array with a [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md) when your code is running."},{"content":"The following example illustrates this.","pos":[1209,1248]},{"pos":[1510,1518],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Arrays<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1522,1606],"source":"[Arrays](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/arrays/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Declare a Structure<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)</ept>","pos":[1610,1739],"source":"[How to: Declare a Structure](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-declare-a-structure.md)"}]}
