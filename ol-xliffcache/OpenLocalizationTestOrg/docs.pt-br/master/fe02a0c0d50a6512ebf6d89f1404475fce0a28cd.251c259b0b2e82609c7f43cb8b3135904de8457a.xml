In such scenarios, a potentially multi-leg exchange occurs between the client and the service to propagate the service credential to the client. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings.NegotiationTimeout%2A> property controls how long the multi-leg exchange can take to complete. However, this timeout only applies if the exchange actually takes more that a single request-response. In cases where the negotiation completes in a single round trip, the timeout does not apply.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings>   \n [How to: Set a Max Clock Skew](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-set-a-max-clock-skew.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,364],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Security Negotiation and Timeouts | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: 02a428f1-84e5-4d28-a11f-53ce31d63196\ncaps.latest.revision: 8\nauthor: \"BrucePerlerMS\"\nms.author: \"bruceper\"\nmanager: \"mbaldwin\"","nodes":[{"content":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,50],"content":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[371,404],"content":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts","linkify":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts","nodes":[{"content":"Security Negotiation and Timeouts","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"When clients and services authenticate, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> supports a mode where the service credential is negotiated as part of authentication.","pos":[405,586],"source":"When clients and services authenticate, [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] supports a mode where the service credential is negotiated as part of authentication."},{"content":"In such scenarios, a potentially multi-leg exchange occurs between the client and the service to propagate the service credential to the client.","pos":[587,731]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings.NegotiationTimeout%2A&gt;</ph> property controls how long the multi-leg exchange can take to complete.","pos":[732,894],"source":" The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings.NegotiationTimeout%2A> property controls how long the multi-leg exchange can take to complete."},{"content":"However, this timeout only applies if the exchange actually takes more that a single request-response.","pos":[895,997]},{"content":"In cases where the negotiation completes in a single round trip, the timeout does not apply.","pos":[998,1090]},{"pos":[1099,1107],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Set a Max Clock Skew<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-set-a-max-clock-skew.md)</ept>","pos":[1180,1289],"source":"[How to: Set a Max Clock Skew](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-set-a-max-clock-skew.md)"}]}
