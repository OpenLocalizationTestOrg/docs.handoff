The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.FromResult%2A> method returns a finished <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> object that holds the provided value as its <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601.Result%2A> property. This method is useful when you perform an asynchronous operation that returns a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> object, and the result of that <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> object is already computed.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example downloads strings from the web. It defines the `DownloadStringAsync` method. This method downloads strings from the web asynchronously. This example also uses a <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary%602> object to cache the results of previous operations. If the input address is held in this cache, `DownloadStringAsync` uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.FromResult%2A> method to produce a <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> object that holds the content at that address. Otherwise, `DownloadStringAsync` downloads the file from the web and adds the result to the cache.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPL_CachedDownloads#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_cacheddownloads/cs/cacheddownloads.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[TPL_CachedDownloads#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_cacheddownloads/vb/cacheddownloads.vb#1)]  \n  \n This example computes the time that is required to download multiple strings two times. The second set of download operations should take less time than the first set because the results are held in the cache. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.FromResult%2A> method enables the `DownloadStringAsync` method to create <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601> objects that hold these pre-computed results.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Copy the example code and paste it in a Visual Studio project, or paste it in a file that is named `CachedDownloads.cs` (`CachedDownloads.vb` for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]), and then run the following command in a Visual Studio Command Prompt window.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]  \n  \n
