Declare a new <xref:System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer> object and call the `static`<xref:System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer%2A> method to find an adorner layer for the element whose children are to be adorned.  \n  \n2.  Enumerate through the children of the parent element and call the <xref:System.Windows.Documents.AdornerLayer.Add%2A> method to bind an adorner to each child element.  \n  \n The following example binds a SimpleCircleAdorner (shown above) to the children of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel> named *myStackPanel*.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Adorners_SimpleCircleAdorner#_AdornChildren](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Adorners_SimpleCircleAdorner/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#_adornchildren)]\n [!code-vb[Adorners_SimpleCircleAdorner#_AdornChildren](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Adorners_SimpleCircleAdorner/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#_adornchildren)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] to bind an adorner to another element is currently not supported.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Adorners Overview](adorners-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,285],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Adorn the Children of a Panel\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
