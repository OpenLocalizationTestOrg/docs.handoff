Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property. You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code. For more information, see [How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems](how-to-disable-toolstripmenuitems.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To disable a menu item at design time  \n  \n1.  With the menu item selected on the form, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  Disabling the first or top-level menu item in a menu disables all the menu items contained within the menu. Likewise, disabling a menu item that has submenu items disables the submenu items. If all the commands on a given menu are unavailable to the user, it is considered good programming practice to both hide and disable the entire menu, as this presents a clean user interface. You should both hide and disable the menu, as hiding alone does not prevent access to a menu command via a shortcut key. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.Visible%2A> property of a top-level menu item to `false` to hide the entire menu.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem>\n- [How to: Hide ToolStripMenuItems](how-to-hide-toolstripmenuitems.md)\n- [MenuStrip Control Overview](menustrip-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ToolStripMenuItems [Windows Forms], disabling in designer\"\n  - \"MenuStrip control [Windows Forms], disabling menu items in designer\"\n  - \"menu items [Windows Forms], disabling\"\n  - \"menus [Windows Forms], disabling items\"\nms.assetid: 985e311e-7d67-4205-b5a3-d045b68a4a03","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[393,446],"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems Using the Designer","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"You can limit or broaden the commands a user may make by enabling and disabling menu items in response to user activities.","pos":[447,569]},{"content":"Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[570,730],"source":" Menu items are enabled by default when they are created, but this can be adjusted through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripMenuItem.Enabled%2A> property."},{"content":"You can manipulate this property at design time in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Properties<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window or programmatically by setting it in code.","pos":[731,850],"source":" You can manipulate this property at design time in the **Properties** window or programmatically by setting it in code."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-disable-toolstripmenuitems.md)</ept>.","pos":[851,952],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Disable ToolStripMenuItems](how-to-disable-toolstripmenuitems.md)."},{"pos":[960,1305],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
