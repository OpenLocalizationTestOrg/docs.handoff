The following procedure generates the error by using a [response file](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n### To generate this error  \n  \n1.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    /target:exe /out:cs|2032.exe cs2032.cs  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want.  \n  \n3.  Open the **Start** menu. Locate and select the [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229859(v=vs.110).aspx).\n  \n4.  Change the current directory to `C:\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\Documents`.  \n  \n5.  Run the following command from the command prompt: `csc @cs2032.rsp`  \n  \n6.  The CS2032 error message appears because the response file, CS2032.rsp, contains a pipe character.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS2032 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS2032 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[543,564],"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","linkify":"Compiler Error CS2032","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS2032","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Character 'character' is not allowed on the command-line or in response files","pos":[565,642]},{"pos":[649,791],"content":"Response files and the command line options for csc.exe cannot contain ASCII control characters in the range 0-31 or the pipe (<ph id=\"ph1\">`|`</ph>) character.","source":"Response files and the command line options for csc.exe cannot contain ASCII control characters in the range 0-31 or the pipe (`|`) character."},{"content":"Compiler error CS2032 is difficult to demonstrate from the command line because the command line processor and the integrated development environment (IDE) filter out characters that are not valid.","pos":[798,995]},{"content":"The following procedure generates the error by using a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>response file<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md)</ept>.","pos":[996,1153],"source":" The following procedure generates the error by using a [response file](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/response-file-compiler-option.md)."},{"pos":[1163,1185],"content":"To generate this error","linkify":"To generate this error","nodes":[{"content":"To generate this error","pos":[0,22]}]},{"pos":[1195,1324],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>My Documents<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:","source":"In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named CS2032.rsp, and then enter the following compiler options in it:"},{"pos":[1408,1519],"content":"In the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>My Documents<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want.","source":"In the **My Documents** folder, create a text file that is named cs2032.cs and that contains whatever you want."},{"content":"Open the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[1529,1553],"source":"Open the **Start** menu."},{"content":"Locate and select the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio<ept id=\"p1\">](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229859(v=vs.110).aspx)</ept>.","pos":[1554,1681],"source":" Locate and select the [Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms229859(v=vs.110).aspx)."},{"pos":[1689,1758],"content":"Change the current directory to <ph id=\"ph1\">`C:\\Users\\\\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\\Documents`</ph>.","source":"Change the current directory to `C:\\Users\\\\<YourUsername>\\Documents`."},{"pos":[1768,1836],"content":"Run the following command from the command prompt: <ph id=\"ph1\">`csc @cs2032.rsp`</ph>","source":"Run the following command from the command prompt: `csc @cs2032.rsp`"},{"content":"The CS2032 error message appears because the response file, CS2032.rsp, contains a pipe character.","pos":[1846,1944]}]}
