For a service operation to become part of an ambient transaction, place a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity within a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity. Any calls made by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> or a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> activity within the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> will also be made within the ambient transaction. A workflow client application can create an ambient transaction by using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity and call service operations using the ambient transaction. This topic walks you through creating a workflow service and workflow client that participate in transactions.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  If a workflow service instance is loaded within a transaction and the workflow contains a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Persist> activity, the workflow instance will hang until the transaction times out.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Whenever you use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> it is recommended to place all Receives in the workflow within <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activities.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  When using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> and messages arrive in the incorrect order, the workflow will be aborted when trying to deliver the first out of order message. You must make sure your workflow is always at a consistent stopping point when the workflow idles. This will allow you to restart the workflow from a previous persistence point should the workflow be aborted.  \n  \n### Create a shared library  \n  \n1.  Create a new empty Visual Studio Solution.  \n  \n2.  Add a new class library project called `Common`. Add references to the following assemblies:  \n  \n    -   System.Activities.dll  \n  \n    -   System.ServiceModel.dll  \n  \n    -   System.ServiceModel.Activities.dll  \n  \n    -   System.Transactions.dll  \n  \n3.  Add a new class called `PrintTransactionInfo` to the `Common` project. This class is derived from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity> and overloads the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity.Execute%2A> method.  \n  \n    ```  \n    using System;  \n    using System;  \n    using System.Activities;  \n    using System.Transactions;  \n  \n    namespace Common  \n    {  \n        public class PrintTransactionInfo : NativeActivity  \n        {  \n            protected override void Execute(NativeActivityContext context)  \n            {  \n                RuntimeTransactionHandle rth = context.Properties.Find(typeof(RuntimeTransactionHandle).FullName) as RuntimeTransactionHandle;  \n  \n                if (rth == null)  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"There is no ambient RuntimeTransactionHandle\");  \n                }  \n  \n                Transaction t = rth.GetCurrentTransaction(context);  \n  \n                if (t == null)  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"There is no ambient transaction\");  \n                }  \n                else  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Transaction: {0} is {1}\", t.TransactionInformation.DistributedIdentifier, t.TransactionInformation.Status);  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     This is a native activity that displays information about the ambient transaction and is used in both the service and client workflows used in this topic. Build the solution to make this activity available in the **Common** section of the **Toolbox**.  \n  \n### Implement the workflow service  \n  \n1.  Add a new [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Workflow Service, called `WorkflowService` to the `Common` project. To do this right click the `Common` project, select **Add**, **New Item ...**, Select **Workflow** under **Installed Templates** and select **WCF Workflow Service**.  \n  \n     ![Adding a Workflow Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/addwfservice.JPG \"AddWFService\")  \n  \n2.  Delete the default `ReceiveRequest` and `SendResponse` activities.  \n  \n3.  Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity into the `Sequential Service` activity. Set the text property to `\"Workflow Service starting ...\"` as shown in the following example.  \n  \n     ![Adding a WriteLine activity](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/addwriteline.JPG \"AddWriteLine\")  \n  \n4.  Drag and drop a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> after the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity can be found in the **Messaging** section of the **Toolbox**. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity is composed of two sections **Request** and **Body**. The **Request** section contains the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity. The **Body** section contains the activities to execute within a transaction after a message has been received.  \n  \n     ![Adding a TransactedReceiveScope activity](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/trs.JPG \"TRS\")  \n  \n5.  Select the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity and click the **Variables** button.

Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity into the Body section of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope>. Within the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity drag and drop two <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activities and set the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine.Text%2A> properties as shown in the following table.  \n  \n    |Activity|Value|  \n    |--------------|-----------|  \n    |1st WriteLine|\"Service: Receive Completed\"|  \n    |2nd WriteLine|\"Service: Received = \" + requestMessage|  \n  \n     The workflow should now look like this:  \n  \n     ![Adding WriteLine activities](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/afteraddingwritelines.JPG \"AfterAddingWriteLines\")  \n  \n9. Drag and drop the `PrintTransactionInfo` activity after the second <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity in the **Body** in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity.  \n  \n     ![After adding PrintTransactionInfo](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/afteraddingprinttransactioninfo.JPG \"AfterAddingPrintTransactionInfo\")  \n  \n10. Drag and drop an <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity after the `PrintTransactionInfo` activity and set its properties according to the following table.  \n  \n    |Property|Value|  \n    |--------------|-----------|  \n    |To|replyMessage|  \n    |Value|\"Service: Sending reply.\"|  \n  \n11. Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity after the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Assign> activity and set its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine.Text%2A> property to \"Service: Begin reply.\"  \n  \n     The workflow should now look like this:  \n  \n     ![After adding Assign and WriteLine](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/afteraddingsbrwriteline.JPG \"AfterAddingSBRWriteLine\")  \n  \n12. Right click the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity and select **Create SendReply** and paste it after the last <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity. Click the **Define...** link in the `SendReplyToReceive` activity and make the following settings.  \n  \n     ![Reply message settings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/replymessagesettings.JPG \"ReplyMessageSettings\")  \n  \n13. Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity after the `SendReplyToReceive` activity and set itâ€™s <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine.Text%2A> property to \"Service: Reply sent.\"  \n  \n14. Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity at the bottom of the workflow and set its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine.Text%2A> property to \"Service: Workflow ends, press ENTER to exit.\"  \n  \n     The completed service workflow should look like this:  \n  \n     ![Complete Service Workflow](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/servicecomplete.jpg \"ServiceComplete\")  \n  \n### Implement the workflow client  \n  \n1.  Add a new WCF Workflow application, called `WorkflowClient` to the `Common` project. To do this right click the `Common` project, select **Add**, **New Item ...**, Select **Workflow** under **Installed Templates** and select **Activity**.  \n  \n     ![Add an Activity project](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/addactivity.JPG \"AddActivity\")  \n  \n2.  Drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity onto the design surface.  \n  \n3.  Within the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity drag and drop a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine> activity and set its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.WriteLine.Text%2A> property to `\"Client: Workflow starting\"`. The workflow should now look like this:  \n  \n     ![Add a WriteLine activity](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/media/clientaddwriteline.JPG \"ClientAddWriteLine\")  \n  \n4.
