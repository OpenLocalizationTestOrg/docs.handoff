Initialize the return string.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#38](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_1.vb)]  \n  \n2.  Determine which serial port should provide the strings. This example assumes it is `COM1`.  \n  \n3.  Use the `My.Computer.Ports.OpenSerialPort` method to obtain a reference to the port. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports.OpenSerialPort%2A>.  \n  \n     The `Try...Catch...Finally` block allows the application to close the serial port even if it generates an exception. All code that manipulates the serial port should appear within this block.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#39](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_2.vb)]  \n  \n4.  Create a `Do` loop for reading lines of text until no more lines are available.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#40](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_3.vb)]  \n  \n5.  Use the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.ReadLine%2A> method to read the next available line of text from the serial port.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#41](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_4.vb)]  \n  \n6.  Use an `If` statement to determine if the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.ReadLine%2A> method returns `Nothing` (which means no more text is available). If it does return `Nothing`, exit the `Do` loop.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#42](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_5.vb)]  \n  \n7.  Add an `Else` block to the `If` statement to handle the case if the string is actually read. The block appends the string from the serial port to the return string.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#43](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_6.vb)]  \n  \n8.  Return the string.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#44](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_7.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#37](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-receive-strings-from-serial-ports_8.vb)]  \n  \n This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Connectivity and Networking**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n This example assumes the computer is using `COM1`. For more flexibility, the code should allow the user to select the desired serial port from a list of available ports. For more information, see [How to: Show Available Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-show-available-serial-ports.md).  \n  \n This example uses a `Try...Catch...Finally` block to make sure that the application closes the port and to catch any timeout exceptions. For more information, see [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n
