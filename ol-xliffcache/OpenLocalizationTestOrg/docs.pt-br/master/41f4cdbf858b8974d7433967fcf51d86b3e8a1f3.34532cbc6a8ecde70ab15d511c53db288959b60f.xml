These constructs include `While` and `If`. These workflows can be freely composed using other flow control activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>.  \n  \n## Controlling Execution Flow  \n The workflow activity library has activities for modeling most flow-control methods used in procedural languages. These include:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.While>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ParallelForEach%601>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Switch%601>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Pick>  \n  \n To use flow control activities, drag and drop them from the **Activity** toolbox into a composite activity inside the designer window.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If using the [!INCLUDE[dublin](../../../includes/dublin-md.md)] to host workflows on a Web farm, AppFabric will move instances between different AppFabric servers. This requires that the resources are able to be shared between all nodes.  None of the default NET 4 workflow activities contain any operations that access local resources. Since AppFabric does not offer any mechanism to mark a workflow as immovable, a developer must not create custom activities that fail when a workflow is moved.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Flowchart Workflows](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/flowchart-workflows.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,49],"content":"Procedural Workflows | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Procedural Workflows | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,37]}]},{"pos":[315,335],"content":"Procedural Workflows","linkify":"Procedural Workflows","nodes":[{"content":"Procedural Workflows","pos":[0,20]}]},{"content":"Procedural workflows use flow-control methods similar to those found in procedural languages.","pos":[336,429]},{"content":"These constructs include <ph id=\"ph1\">`While`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`If`</ph>.","pos":[430,472],"source":" These constructs include `While` and `If`."},{"content":"These workflows can be freely composed using other flow control activities such as <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence&gt;</ph>.","pos":[473,651],"source":" These workflows can be freely composed using other flow control activities such as <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> and <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>."},{"pos":[660,686],"content":"Controlling Execution Flow","linkify":"Controlling Execution Flow","nodes":[{"content":"Controlling Execution Flow","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"The workflow activity library has activities for modeling most flow-control methods used in procedural languages.","pos":[690,803]},{"content":"These include:","pos":[804,818]},{"pos":[1259,1393],"content":"To use flow control activities, drag and drop them from the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Activity<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> toolbox into a composite activity inside the designer window.","source":"To use flow control activities, drag and drop them from the **Activity** toolbox into a composite activity inside the designer window."},{"pos":[1401,1908],"content":"[!NOTE]\n If using the [!INCLUDE[dublin](../../../includes/dublin-md.md)] to host workflows on a Web farm, AppFabric will move instances between different AppFabric servers.
