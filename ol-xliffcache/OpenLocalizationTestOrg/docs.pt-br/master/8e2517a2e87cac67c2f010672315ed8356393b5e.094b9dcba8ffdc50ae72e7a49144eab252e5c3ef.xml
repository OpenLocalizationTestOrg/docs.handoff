This topic is based on the [AdventureWorks Sales](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f16cd988-673f-4376-b034-129ca93c7832) conceptual model. The AdventureWorks Sales Model is used throughout the task-related topics in the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] documentation. This topic assumes that you have already configured the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)] and defined the AdventureWorks Sales Model. For more information, see [How to: Manually Define the Model and Mapping Files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d4fd6864-f2a1-48f0-aa32-1e318775a99a). The procedures in this topic are also included in [How to: Manually Configure an Entity Framework Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/73f6ae1d-b3b2-4577-aebd-ad5a75954e9e).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_edm](../../../../../includes/adonet-edm-md.md)] Wizard in a [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] project, it automatically generates an .edmx file and configures the project to use the [!INCLUDE[adonet_ef](../../../../../includes/adonet-ef-md.md)].
