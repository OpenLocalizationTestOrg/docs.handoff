A .NET Framework object is located in managed memory—the memory controlled by the common language runtime—and may be moved by the runtime as needed. A COM object is located in unmanaged memory and is not expected to move to another memory location. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] provide tools to control the interaction of these managed and unmanaged components. For more information about managed code, see [Common Language Runtime](../../../standard/clr.md).  \n  \n In addition to using COM objects in .NET applications, you may also want to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] to develop objects accessible from unmanaged code through COM.  \n  \n The links on this page provide details on the interactions between COM and .NET Framework objects.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [COM Interop](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/index.md)  \n Provides links to topics covering COM interoperability in Visual Basic, including COM objects, ActiveX controls, Win32 DLLs, managed objects, and inheritance of COM objects.  \n  \n [COM Interop Wrapper Error](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/misc/com-interop-wrapper-error)  \n Describes the consequences and options if the project system cannot create a COM interoperability wrapper for a particular component.  \n  \n [Interoperating with Unmanaged Code](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/sd10k43k)  \n Briefly describes some of the interaction issues between managed and unmanaged code, and provides links for further study.  \n  \n [COM Wrappers](../../../framework/interop/com-wrappers.md)  \n Discusses runtime callable wrappers, which allow managed code to call COM methods, and COM callable wrappers, which allow COM clients to call .NET object methods.  \n  \n [Advanced COM Interoperability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3ada36e5-2390-4d70-b490-6ad8de92f2fb)  \n Provides links to topics covering COM interoperability with respect to wrappers, exceptions, inheritance, threading, events, conversions, and marshaling.  \n  \n [Tlbimp.exe (Type Library Importer)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ec0a8d63-11b3-4acd-b398-da1e37e97382)  \n Discusses the tool you can use to convert the type definitions found within a COM type library into equivalent definitions in a common language runtime assembly.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,95],"content":"COM Interoperability in .NET Framework Applications (Visual Basic) | Microsoft
