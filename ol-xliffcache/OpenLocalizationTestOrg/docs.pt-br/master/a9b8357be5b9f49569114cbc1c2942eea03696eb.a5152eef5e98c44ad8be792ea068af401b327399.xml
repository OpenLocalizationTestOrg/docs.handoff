You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) in a configuration file. If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory. If the assembly has a strong name, the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) can specify any location on the computer or on a network.  \n  \n Similar rules apply to locating assemblies when working with unmanaged code or COM interop applications: if the assembly will be shared by multiple applications, it should be installed into the global assembly cache. Assemblies used with unmanaged code must be exported as a type library and registered. Assemblies used by COM interop must be registered in the catalog, although in some cases this registration occurs automatically.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)\n- [Configuring Apps](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md)\n- [Interoperating with unmanaged code](../../../docs/framework/interop/index.md)\n- [Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,304],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Assembly Placement\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"<codeBase> element\"\n  - \"locating assemblies\"\n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], placement\"\n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], location\"\nms.assetid: ff8d48bc-f606-484f-9fe1-d0af264269fb\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"Assembly Placement","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"Assembly Placement","nodes":[{"content":"Assembly Placement","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[311,329],"content":"Assembly Placement","linkify":"Assembly Placement","nodes":[{"content":"Assembly Placement","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"For most .NET Framework applications, you locate assemblies that make up an application in the application's directory, in a subdirectory of the application's directory, or in the global assembly cache (if the assembly is shared).","pos":[330,560]},{"content":"You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> in a configuration file.","pos":[561,773],"source":" You can override where the common language runtime looks for an assembly by using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) in a configuration file."},{"content":"If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory.","pos":[774,1015],"source":" If the assembly does not have a strong name, the location specified using the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) is restricted to the application directory or a subdirectory."},{"content":"If the assembly has a strong name, the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>codeBase&gt; Element<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md)</ept> can specify any location on the computer or on a network.","pos":[1016,1214],"source":" If the assembly has a strong name, the [\\<codeBase> Element](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/codebase-element.md) can specify any location on the computer or on a network."},{"content":"Similar rules apply to locating assemblies when working with unmanaged code or COM interop applications: if the assembly will be shared by multiple applications, it should be installed into the global assembly cache.","pos":[1221,1437]},{"content":"Assemblies used with unmanaged code must be exported as a type library and registered.","pos":[1438,1524]},{"content":"Assemblies used by COM interop must be registered in the catalog, although in some cases this registration occurs automatically.","pos":[1525,1653]},{"pos":[1662,1670],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1674,1784],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How the Runtime Locates Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)</ept>","source":"[How the Runtime Locates Assemblies](../../../docs/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies.md)"},{"pos":[1787,1854],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Configuring Apps<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Configuring Apps](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/index.md)"},{"pos":[1857,1935],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Interoperating with unmanaged code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/interop/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Interoperating with unmanaged code](../../../docs/framework/interop/index.md)"},{"pos":[1938,2063],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)</ept>","source":"[Assemblies in the Common Language Runtime](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime.md)"}]}
