Such methods invoke operations on a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service from a client but do not expect a reply. This type of contract can be used, for example, to publish notifications to many subscribers. You can also use one-way contracts when creating a duplex (two-way) contract, which allows clients and servers to communicate with each other independently so that either can initiate calls to the other. This can allow, in particular, the server to make one-way calls to the client that the client can treat as events. For detailed information about specifying one-way methods, see the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] creating a client application for a duplex contract, see [How to: Access Services with One-Way and Request-Reply Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-access-wcf-services-with-one-way-and-request-reply-contracts.md). For a working sample, see the [One-Way](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-way.md) sample.  \n  \n### To create a one-way contract  \n  \n1.  Create the service contract by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> class to the interface that defines the methods the service is to implement.  \n  \n2.  Indicate which methods in the interface a client can invoked by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to them.  \n  \n3.  Designate operations that must have no output (no return value and no out or ref parameters) as one-way by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `true`. Note that the operations that carry the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class satisfy a request-reply contract by default because the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property is `false` by default. So you must explicitly specify the value of the attribute property to be `true` if you want a one-way contract for the method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example defines a contract for a service that includes several one-way methods. All of the methods have one-way contracts except `Equals`, which defaults to request-reply and returns a result.  \n  \n
