Controls are objects that are contained within form objects. Each type of control has its own set of properties, methods, and events that make it suitable for a particular purpose. You can manipulate controls in the designer and write code to add controls dynamically at run time.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Putting Controls on Windows Forms](putting-controls-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides links related to putting controls on forms.  \n  \n [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides links related to arranging controls on forms.  \n  \n [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)  \n Describes the uses of keyboard shortcuts, text labels on controls, and modifier keys.  \n  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Lists the controls that work with Windows Forms, and basic things you can accomplish with each control.  \n  \n [Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework](developing-custom-windows-forms-controls.md)  \n Provides background information and samples to help users develop custom Windows Forms controls.  \n  \n [Developing Windows Forms Controls at Design Time](developing-windows-forms-controls-at-design-time.md)  \n Describes techniques for creating custom controls through design and inheritance.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Client Applications](../../develop-client-apps.md)  \n Provides an overview of developing Windows-based applications.  \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,247],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Windows Forms Controls\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
