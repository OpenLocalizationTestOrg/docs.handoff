With this tool you can create, edit, and sign deployment and application manifests. New manifests that are created with MageUI.exe target the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v40_long](../../../includes/net-client-v40-long-md.md)]. Previous versions of MageUI.exe should be used to target previous .NET Framework versions. When adding or removing assemblies from a manifest, or re-signing existing manifests, MageUI.exe does not update the manifest to target [!INCLUDE[net_client_v40_long](../../../includes/net-client-v40-long-md.md)]. For more information, see [Mage.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool)](../../../docs/framework/tools/mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).  \n  \n This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To run the tool, use the Developer Command Prompt (or the Visual Studio Command Prompt in Windows 7). For more information, see [Command Prompts](../../../docs/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md).  \n  \n Two versions of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe are included as a component of the [!INCLUDE[vs_dev10_long](../../../includes/vs-dev10-long-md.md)] setup. To see version information, run MageUI.exe, select **Help**, and select **About**. This documentation describes version 4.0.x.x of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  MageUI.exe does not support the [compatibleFrameworks](/visualstudio/deployment/compatibleframeworks-element-clickonce-deployment) element when saving an application manifest that has already been signed with a certificate using MageUI.exe. Instead, you must use [Mage.exe](../../../docs/framework/tools/mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).  \n  \n## UIElement List  \n The following table lists the menu and toolbar items that are available.  \n  \n|Command|Menu|Shortcut|Description|  \n|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|  \n|**Application Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new application manifest.|  \n|**Deployment Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new deployment manifest.|  \n|**Open**|**File**|CTRL+O|Opens an existing deployment manifest, application manifest, or trust license for editing.|  \n|**Close**|**File**|CTRL+F4|Closes an open file.<br /><br /> If you modify a file before closing it, MageUI.exe prompts you to re-sign the file with a public key, key pair, or stored certificate.|  \n|**Save**|**File**|CTRL+S|Saves to disk the document which currently has user input focus.|  \n|**Save As**|**File**||Saves a file to disk, enabling you to supply a new file name and/or location.|  \n|**Save All**|**File**||Saves the changes made to all files currently open within MageUI.exe.|  \n|**Preferences**|**File**||Opens the **Preferences** dialog box. See the following section for more information.|  \n|**Exit**|**File**|ALT+F4|Quits MageUI.exe.|  \n|**Cut**|**Edit**|CTRL+X|Removes the currently selected text from the application and moves it to the system Clipboard.|  \n|**Copy**|**Edit**|CTRL+C|Copies the currently selected text to the system Clipboard.|  \n|**Paste**|**Edit**|CTRL+V|Pastes text from the system Clipboard into the currently active text element.|  \n|**Delete**|**Edit**||Deletes an element currently selected in a list, such as a trust license on the **Deployment Manifest** tab.|  \n|**Close All**|**Window**||Closes all files currently open in MageUI.exe. If one or more files need saving, MageUI.exe prompts you to save them. MageUI.exe also prompts you to select a signing key for each unsigned or changed file.|  \n|**About**|**Help**||Displays version and copyright information about MageUI.exe.|  \n  \n## Preferences Dialog Box  \n The **Preferences** dialog box contains the following elements.  \n  \n|UI Element|Description|  \n|----------------|-----------------|  \n|**Sign on save**|Prompts you to sign a file whenever you save your modifications.|  \n|**Use default signing certificate**|Uses the key entered in the **Certificate file** text box to sign all files. This eliminates the signing prompt that typically appears when you save a file and **Sign on Save** is selected. Use the ellipsis (**…**) button next to the **Certificate file** text box to select a key file.|  \n|Digest algorithm|Specifies the algorithm to generate dependency digests with. Value must be \"sha256RSA\" or \"sha1RSA\". Uses SHA1 as the default. Used both in application and deployment manifests. If the user provides a certificate when saving the manifest, uses the algorithms in the certificate to generate dependency digests with.|  \n  \n## Signing Options Dialog Box  \n The **Signing Options** dialog box appears when you save a manifest or trust license for the first time, or when you change a manifest or trust license. It only appears if the **Sign on Save** option in the **Preferences** dialog box is selected. You must be connected to the Internet when signing a manifest that specifies a value in the **TimeStamping URI** text box.  \n  \n This dialog box contains the following elements.  \n  \n|UI Element|Description|  \n|----------------|-----------------|  \n|**Sign with certificate file**|Signs the manifest with a digital certificate stored on the file system.|  \n|**File**|Provides an area to type the path to the .pfx file representing the certificate.|  \n|**...**|Opens a **Choose File** dialog box for selecting an existing .pfx file.|  \n|**New**|Generates a new .pfx that is not verifiable through a Certificate Authority (CA).

If not applicable, can be left blank.|  \n|**Sign with stored certificate**|Displays a selectable list of digital certificates stored in your computer's certificate store.|  \n|**TimeStamping URI**|Displays the Uniform Resource Locator (URI) of a digital timestamping service. Timestamping the manifests prevents you from having to re-sign the manifests if your digital certificate expires before you deploy the next version of your application. For more information, see [Windows root certificate program members](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=159000) and [ClickOnce and Authenticode](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-and-authenticode).|  \n|**Don't Sign**|Allows you to save the manifest without adding a signature from a digital certificate.|  \n  \n## Tab and Panel Descriptions  \n When you open a document with MageUI.exe, it appears within its own tab page. Each tab contains a set of property panels. The panels contain grouped subsets of the document's data.  \n  \n### Application Manifest Tab  \n The **Application Manifest** tab displays the contents of an application manifest.
