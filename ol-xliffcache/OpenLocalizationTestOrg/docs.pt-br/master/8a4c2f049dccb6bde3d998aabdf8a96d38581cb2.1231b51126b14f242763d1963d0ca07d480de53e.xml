In the past, localization of a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was a time consuming process. Each language that the              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required a pixel by pixel adjustment. Today with the right design and right coding standards,              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uisharpplural-md.md)] can be constructed so that localizers have less resizing and repositioning to do. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called automatic layout, and can be achieved by using              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] application design.  \n  \n This topic contains the following sections.  \n  \n<a name=\"autoTopLevelSectionsOUTLINE0\"></a>   \n-   [Advantages of Using Automatic Layout](#advantages_of_autolayout)  \n  \n-   [Automatic Layout and Controls](#autolayout_controls)  \n  \n-   [Automatic Layout and Coding Standards](#autolayout_coding)  \n  \n-   [Automatic Layout and Grids](#autolay_grids)  \n  \n-   [Automatic Layout and Grids Using the IsSharedSizeScope Property](#autolay_grids_issharedsizescope)  \n  \n<a name=\"advantages_of_autolayout\"></a>   \n## Advantages of Using Automatic Layout  \n Because the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] presentation system is powerful and flexible, it provides the ability to layout elements in an application that can be adjusted to fit the requirements of different languages.

For example, a control can change to accommodate the length of a string. This capability enables  localizers to translate the string; they no longer need to resize the control to fit the translated text. The following example creates a button with English content.  \n  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationBtn_snip#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn_snip/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n In the example, all you have to do to make a Spanish button is change the text. For example,  \n  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationBtn#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the output of the code samples.  \n  \n ![The same button with text in different languages](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/globalizationbutton.png \"GlobalizationButton\")  \nAuto Resizable Button  \n  \n<a name=\"autolayout_coding\"></a>   \n## Automatic Layout and Coding Standards  \n Using the automatic layout approach requires a set of coding and design standards and rules to produce a fully localizable                   [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)].

A                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> control is capable of distributing the available space among its child elements, using a column and row arrangement. The                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] elements can span multiple cells, and it is possible to have grids within grids. Grids are useful because they enable you to create and position complex                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]. The following example demonstrates using a grid to position some buttons and text. Notice that the height and width of the cells are set to                  <xref:System.Windows.GridUnitType>; therefore, the cell that contains the button with an image adjusts to fit the image.  \n  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationGrid#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationGrid/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the grid produced by the previous code.  \n  \n ![Grid example](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/glob-grid.png \"glob_grid\")  \nGrid  \n  \n<a name=\"autolay_grids_issharedsizescope\"></a>   \n## Automatic Layout and Grids Using the IsSharedSizeScope Property  \n A                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element is useful in localizable applications to create controls that adjust to fit content. However, at times you want controls to maintain a particular size regardless of content. For example, if you have \"OK\", \"Cancel\" and \"Browse\" buttons you probably do not want the buttons sized to fit the content. In this case the                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached property is useful for sharing the same sizing among multiple grid elements. The following example demonstrates how to share column and row sizing data between multiple                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements.  \n  \n
