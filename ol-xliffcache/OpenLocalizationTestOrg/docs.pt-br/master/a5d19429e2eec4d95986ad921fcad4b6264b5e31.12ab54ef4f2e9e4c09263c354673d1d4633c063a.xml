Objects that inherit from `MarshalByRefObject` are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain. If any code ever attempts to directly access the value-type member of such an object across an application domain, a runtime exception will occur. To resolve the warning, first copy the member into a local variable and call the method on that variable.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS1690:  \n  \n```  \n// CS1690.cs  \nusing System;  \n  \nclass WarningCS1690: MarshalByRefObject  \n{  \n   int i = 5;  \n  \n   public static void Main()   \n   {  \n     WarningCS1690 e = new WarningCS1690();  \n     e.i.ToString();   // CS1690  \n  \n     // OK  \n     int i = e.i;  \n     i.ToString();  \n     e.i = i;  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[555,588],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Accessing a member on 'member' may cause a runtime exception because it is a field of a marshal-by-reference class","pos":[589,703]},{"content":"This warning occurs when you try to call a method, property, or indexer on a member of a class that derives from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.MarshalByRefObject&gt;</ph>, and the member is a value type.","pos":[710,888],"source":"This warning occurs when you try to call a method, property, or indexer on a member of a class that derives from <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>, and the member is a value type."},{"content":"Objects that inherit from <ph id=\"ph1\">`MarshalByRefObject`</ph> are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain.","pos":[889,1017],"source":" Objects that inherit from `MarshalByRefObject` are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain."},{"content":"If any code ever attempts to directly access the value-type member of such an object across an application domain, a runtime exception will occur.","pos":[1018,1164]},{"content":"To resolve the warning, first copy the member into a local variable and call the method on that variable.","pos":[1165,1270]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1690:","pos":[1277,1315]}]}
