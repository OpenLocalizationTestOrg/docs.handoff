        <trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These changes occurred with the release of .NET Core SDK 1.0 and Visual Studio 2017 on March 7, 2017 (see the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>announcement<ept id="p1">](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-tools-1-0/)</ept>) but were initially implemented with the release of the .NET Core SDK Preview 3.</source>

        <trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The biggest change in the tooling for .NET Core is certainly the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>move away from project.json to csproj<ept id="p1">](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/changes-to-project-json/)</ept> as the project system.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The latest versions of the command-line tools don't support <bpt id="p1">*</bpt>project.json<ept id="p1">*</ept> files.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>That means that it cannot be used to build, run or publish project.json based applications and libraries.</source>

        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In order to use this version of the tools, you will need to migrate your existing projects or start new ones.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As part of this move, the custom build engine that was developed to build project.json projects was replaced with a mature and fully capable build engine called <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>MSBuild<ept id="p1">](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild)</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>MSBuild is a well-known engine in the .NET community, since it has been a key technology since the platform's first release.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Of course, because it needs to build .NET Core applications, MSBuild has been ported to .NET Core and can be used on any platform that .NET Core runs on.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the main promises of .NET Core is that of a cross-platform development stack, and we have made sure that this move does not break that promise.</source>

        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With the move away from the existing project system as well as with building engine switches, the question that naturally follows is do any of these changes change the overall "layering" of the whole .NET Core tooling ecosystem?</source>

          <source>Let's start with a quick refresher on Preview 2 layering as shown in the following picture:</source>

        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The layering of the tools is quite simple.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>At the bottom we have the .NET Core Command Line tools as a foundation.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>All other, higher-level tools such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code, depend and rely on the CLI to build projects, restore dependencies and so on.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This meant that, for example, if Visual Studio wanted to perform a restore operation, it would call into <ph id="ph1">`dotnet restore`</ph> (<bpt id="p1">[</bpt>see note<ept id="p1">](#dotnet-restore-note)</ept>) command in the CLI.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>With the move to the new project system, the previous diagram changes:</source>

        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>.NET Core SDK 1.0.0 high-level architecture</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The main difference is that the CLI is not the foundational layer anymore; this role is now filled by the "shared SDK component".</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This shared SDK component is a set of targets and associated tasks that are responsible for compiling your code, publishing it, packing NuGet packages etc. The SDK itself is open-source and is available on GitHub on the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>SDK repo<ept id="p1">](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>A "target" is a MSBuild term that indicates a named operation that MSBuild can invoke.</source>

        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It is usually coupled with one or more tasks that execute some logic that the target is supposed to do.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>MSBuild supports many ready-made targets such as <ph id="ph1">`Copy`</ph> or <ph id="ph2">`Execute`</ph>; it also allows users to write their own tasks using managed code and define targets to execute those tasks.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For more information, see <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>MSBuild tasks<ept id="p1">](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-tasks)</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>All the toolsets now consume the shared SDK component and its targets, CLI included.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, the next version of Visual Studio will not call into <ph id="ph1">`dotnet restore`</ph> (<bpt id="p1">[</bpt>see note<ept id="p1">](#dotnet-restore-note)</ept>) command to restore dependencies for .NET Core projects, it will use the "Restore" target directly.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Since these are MSBuild targets, you can also use raw MSBuild to execute them using the <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>dotnet msbuild<ept id="p1">](dotnet-msbuild.md)</ept> command.</source>

        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The shared SDK component means that the majority of existing CLI commands have been re-implemented as MSBuild tasks and targets.</source>

          <source>What does this mean for the CLI commands and your usage of the toolset?</source>

          <source>From an usage perspective, it doesn't change the way you use the CLI.</source>

          <source>The CLI still has the core commands that exist in Preview 2 release:</source>

        <trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>These commands still do what you expect them to do (new up a project, build it, publish it, pack it and so on).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="142" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Majority of the options are not changed, and are still there, and you can consult either the commands' help screens (using <ph id="ph1">`dotnet &lt;command&gt; --help`</ph>) or documentation on this site to get familiar with any changes.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="143" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>From an execution perspective, the CLI commands will take their parameters and construct a call to "raw" MSBuild that will set the needed properties and run the desired target.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="144" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To better illustrate this, consider the following command:</source>

        <trans-unit id="147" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The notable exception to this rule are <ph id="ph1">`new`</ph> and <ph id="ph2">`run`</ph> commands, as they have not been implemented as MSBuild targets.</source>
