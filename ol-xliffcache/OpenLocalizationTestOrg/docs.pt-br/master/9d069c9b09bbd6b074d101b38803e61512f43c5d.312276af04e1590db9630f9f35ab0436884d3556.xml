One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim first? As Integer  \nDim second As String = \"First is Nothing\"  \n'' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(first, second))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33110  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Console.WriteLine(If(first, CInt(second)))   \n    ```  \n  \n-   Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.  \n  \n    ```  \n    If first IsNot Nothing Then  \n        Console.WriteLine(first)  \n    Else  \n        Console.WriteLine(second)  \n    End If  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)\n- [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)\n- [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,249],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc33110\"\n  - \"bc33110\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33110\"\nms.assetid: f46873aa-f6cd-4cc9-9e8e-e668bddf0980","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","nodes":[{"pos":[0,88],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","pos":[0,88]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[256,344],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","linkify":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator","pos":[0,88]}]},{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator.","pos":[345,434]},{"content":"One must have a widening conversion to the other.","pos":[435,484]},{"content":"The binary <ph id=\"ph1\">`If`</ph> operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument.","pos":[491,613],"source":"The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument."},{"content":"For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between <ph id=\"ph1\">`Integer`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`String`</ph>, the following code causes this error.","pos":[614,759],"source":" For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error."},{"pos":[908,929],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33110","source":"**Error ID:** BC33110"},{"pos":[938,959],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:","pos":[969,1058]},{"content":"Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.","pos":[1141,1204]},{"pos":[1365,1373],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1377,1454],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1457,1598],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Widening and Narrowing Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)</ept>","source":"[Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)"},{"pos":[1601,1705],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)"}]}
