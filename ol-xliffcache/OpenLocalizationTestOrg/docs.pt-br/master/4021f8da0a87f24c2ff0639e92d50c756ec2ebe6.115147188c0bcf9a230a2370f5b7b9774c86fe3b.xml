First you need to create a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object by using the bitmap constructor that takes a file name, <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.%23ctor%28System.String%29>. This constructor accepts images with several different file formats, including BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF. After you have created the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object, pass that <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> object from a JPEG file and then draws the bitmap with its upper-left corner at (60, 10).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the bitmap drawn at the specified location.  \n  \n ![Image Position](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/csimageposition1.png \"csimageposition1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#21](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n

preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)   \n [Working with Images, Bitmaps,
