Data types, method signatures, and error-handling mechanisms vary between managed and unmanaged object models. To simplify interoperation between .NET Framework components and unmanaged code and to ease the migration path, the common language runtime conceals from both clients and servers the differences in these object models.  \n  \n Code that executes under the control of the runtime is called managed code. Conversely, code that runs outside the runtime is called unmanaged code. COM components, ActiveX interfaces, and Win32 API functions are examples of unmanaged code.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Interoperating with Unmanaged Code How-to Topics](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ec21c6e1-e233-4cd9-95ae-b9b9cf807f9d)  \n Provides links to all How-to topics found in the conceptual documentation for interoperating with unmanaged code.  \n
