The naming convention in Windows Forms is to append the word *Changed* to the name of the property. The associated event delegate type for property-changed events is <xref:System.EventHandler>, and the event data type is <xref:System.EventArgs>. The base class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> defines many property-changed events, such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColorChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImageChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.FontChanged>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.LocationChanged>, and others. For background information about events, see [Events](../../../standard/events/index.md) and [Events in Windows Forms Controls](events-in-windows-forms-controls.md).  \n  \n Property-changed events are useful because they allow consumers of a control to attach event handlers that respond to the change. If your control needs to respond to a property-changed event that it raises, override the corresponding `On`*PropertyName*`Changed` method instead of attaching a delegate to the event. A control typically responds to a property-changed event by updating other properties or by redrawing some or all of its drawing surface.  \n  \n The following example shows how the `FlashTrackBar` custom control responds to some of the property-changed events that it inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>. For the complete sample, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).  \n  \n
