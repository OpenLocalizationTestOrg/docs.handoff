In addition, <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimationUsingKeyFrames> is used to animate the direction the camera is pointing in the 3D scene. Both of these animations use several key frames which create a series of animation effects:  \n  \n1.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.LinearPoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.LinearVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create a smooth, linear interpolation between values.  \n  \n2.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DiscretePoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DiscreteVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create sudden \"jumps\" between values (no interpolation).  \n  \n3.  <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplinePoint3DKeyFrame> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplineVector3DKeyFrame> are used to create a variable transition between values depending on the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.SplinePoint3DKeyFrame.KeySpline%2A> property. In the example below, the animation starts off slow but toward the end of the time segment, speeds up exponentially.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationUsingKeyFramesExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationUsingKeyFramesExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationusingkeyframesexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene](how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-in-a-3d-scene.md)\n- [3-D Graphics Overview](3-d-graphics-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,491],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
