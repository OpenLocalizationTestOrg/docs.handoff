This often means that lines of code you expect to be executed are bypassed. Some resource cleanup, such as closing a file, needs to be done even if an exception is thrown. To do this, you can use a `finally` block. A `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.\n\nThe following code example uses a `try`/`catch` block to catch an @System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException. The `Main` method creates two arrays and attempts to copy one to the other. The action generates an @System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException and the error is written to the console. The `finally` block executes regardless of the outcome of the copy action.\n\n[!code-cpp[CodeTryCatchFinallyExample#3](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/CodeTryCatchFinallyExample/CPP/source2.cpp#3)]\n[!code-csharp[CodeTryCatchFinallyExample#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/CodeTryCatchFinallyExample/CS/source2.cs#3)]\n[!code-vb[CodeTryCatchFinallyExample#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/CodeTryCatchFinallyExample/VB/source2.vb#3)]  \n\n## See Also  \n[Exceptions](index.md)   \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,510],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Finally Blocks | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"exceptions, try/catch blocks\"\n  - \"exceptions, finally blocks\"\n  - \"try/catch blocks\"\n  - \"finally blocks\"\n  - \"ArgumentOutOfRangeException class\"\nms.assetid: 4b9c0137-04af-4468-91d1-b9014df8ddd2\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Finally Blocks | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"How to: Use Finally Blocks | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Finally Blocks | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[517,542],"content":"How to use finally blocks","linkify":"How to use finally blocks","nodes":[{"content":"How to use finally blocks","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"When an exception occurs, execution stops and control is given to the appropriate exception handler.","pos":[544,644]},{"content":"This often means that lines of code you expect to be executed are bypassed.","pos":[645,720]},{"content":"Some resource cleanup, such as closing a file, needs to be done even if an exception is thrown.","pos":[721,816]},{"content":"To do this, you can use a <ph id=\"ph1\">`finally`</ph> block.","pos":[817,859],"source":" To do this, you can use a `finally` block."},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`finally`</ph> block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown.","pos":[860,940],"source":" A `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception is thrown."},{"content":"The following code example uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">`try`</ph><ph id=\"ph2\">/</ph><ph id=\"ph3\">`catch`</ph> block to catch an <ph id=\"ph4\">@System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</ph>.","pos":[942,1044],"source":"The following code example uses a `try`/`catch` block to catch an @System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method creates two arrays and attempts to copy one to the other.","pos":[1045,1120],"source":" The `Main` method creates two arrays and attempts to copy one to the other."},{"content":"The action generates an <ph id=\"ph1\">@System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</ph> and the error is written to the console.","pos":[1121,1221],"source":" The action generates an @System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException and the error is written to the console."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`finally`</ph> block executes regardless of the outcome of the copy action.","pos":[1222,1296],"source":" The `finally` block executes regardless of the outcome of the copy action."},{"pos":[1715,1723],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1726,1748],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Exceptions<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Exceptions](index.md)"}]}
