This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>. You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationExampleWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation>\n- [Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames](how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)\n- [3-D Graphics Overview](3-d-graphics-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,480],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"animation [WPF], camera position in 3-D scenes\"\n  - \"camera direction [WPF], animating in 3-D scenes\"\n  - \"3-D scenes [WPF], animating camera position\"\n  - \"3-D scenes [WPF], animating camera direction\"\n  - \"camera position [WPF], animating in 3-D scenes\"\n  - \"animation [WPF], camera direction in 3-D scenes\"\nms.assetid: 480224b7-a5e5-4165-ba7f-ef760ddff94a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[487,546],"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","linkify":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to animate the position of a camera and animate the direction it is pointing in a 3D scene.","pos":[547,670]},{"content":"This is done by using <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation&gt;</ph> to animate the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A&gt;</ph> properties respectively of the <ph id=\"ph5\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera&gt;</ph>.","pos":[671,1047],"source":" This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>."},{"content":"You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.","pos":[1048,1150]},{"pos":[1159,1166],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1399,1407],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1526,1648],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)</ept>","source":"[Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames](how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)"},{"pos":[1651,1700],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>3-D Graphics Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](3-d-graphics-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[3-D Graphics Overview](3-d-graphics-overview.md)"}]}
