If you prefer to follow the tutorial using a pre-built solution, [view or download the sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-mstest/) before you begin. For download instructions, see [Samples and Tutorials](../../samples-and-tutorials/index.md#viewing-and-downloading-samples).\n\n### Creating the source project\n\nOpen a shell window. Create a directory called *unit-testing-using-dotnet-test* to hold the solution. Inside this new directory, create a *PrimeService* directory. The directory structure thus far is shown below:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-using-mstest\n    /PrimeService\n```\n\nMake *PrimeService* the current directory and run [`dotnet new classlib`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) to create the source project. Rename *Class1.cs* to *PrimeService.cs*. To use test-driven development (TDD), you'll create a failing implementation of the `PrimeService` class:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace Prime.Services\n{\n    public class PrimeService\n    {\n        public bool IsPrime(int candidate) \n        {\n            throw new NotImplementedException(\"Please create a test first\");\n        } \n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Creating the test project\n\nChange the directory back to the *unit-testing-using-mstest* directory and create the *PrimeService.Tests* directory. The directory structure is shown below:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-using-mstest\n    /PrimeService\n        Source Files\n        PrimeService.csproj\n    /PrimeService.Tests\n```\n\nMake the *PrimeService.Tests* directory the current directory and create a new project using [`dotnet new mstest`](../tools/dotnet-new.md). This creates a test project that uses MStest as the test library. The generated template configures the test runner in the *PrimeServiceTests.csproj* file:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"15.0.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"MSTest.TestAdapter\" Version=\"1.1.11\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"MSTest.TestFramework\" Version=\"1.1.11\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThe test project requires other packages to create and run unit tests. `dotnet new` in the previous step added the MSTest SDK, the MSTest test framework, and the MSTest runner. Now, add the `PrimeService` class library as another dependency to the project. Use the [`dotnet add reference`](../tools/dotnet-add-reference.md) command:\n\n```\ndotnet add reference ../PrimeService/PrimeService.csproj\n```\n\nAnother option is to edit the *PrimeService.Tests.csproj* file. Directly under the first `<ItemGroup>` node, add another `<ItemGroup>` node with a reference to the library project:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\PrimeService\\PrimeService.csproj\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nYou can see the entire file in the [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.csproj) on GitHub.\n\nThe final solution layout is shown below:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-using-mstest\n    /PrimeService\n        Source Files\n        PrimeService.csproj\n    /PrimeService.Tests\n        PrimeService\n        PrimeServiceTests.csproj\n```\n\n## Creating the first test\n\nBefore building the library or the tests, execute [`dotnet restore`](../tools/dotnet-restore.md) in the *PrimeService.Tests* directory. This command restores all the necessary NuGet packages for each project.\n\nThe TDD approach calls for writing one failing test, making it pass, then repeating the process. Remove *UnitTest1.cs* from the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and create a new C# file named *PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs* with the following content:\n\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing Prime.Services;\n\nnamespace Prime.UnitTests.Services\n{\n    [TestClass]\n    public class PrimeService_IsPrimeShould\n    {\n        private readonly PrimeService _primeService;\n\n        public PrimeService_IsPrimeShould()\n        {\n            _primeService = new PrimeService();\n        }\n\n        [TestMethod]\n        public void ReturnFalseGivenValueOf1()\n        {\n            var result = _primeService.IsPrime(1);\n\n            Assert.IsFalse(result, $\"1 should not be prime\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe `[TestClass]` attribute denotes a class that contains unit tests. The `[TestMethod]` attribute denotes a method as a single test. \n\nSave this file and execute [`dotnet test`](../tools/dotnet-test.md) to build the tests and the class library and then run the tests. The MSTest test runner contains the program entry point to run your tests. `dotnet test` starts the test runner and provides a command-line argument to the test runner indicating the assembly that contains your tests.\n\nYour test fails. You haven't created the implementation yet. Write the simplest code in the `PrimeService` class to make this test pass:\n\n```csharp\npublic bool IsPrime(int candidate) \n{\n    if (candidate == 1) \n    { \n        return false;\n    } \n    throw new NotImplementedException(\"Please create a test first\");\n} \n```\n\nIn the *PrimeService.Tests* directory, run `dotnet test` again. The `dotnet test` command runs a build for the `PrimeService` project and then for the `PrimeService.Tests` project. After building both projects, it runs this single test. It passes.\n\n## Adding more features\n\nNow that you've made one test pass, it's time to write more. There are a few other simple cases for prime numbers: 0, -1. You could add those as new tests with the `[TestMethod]` attribute, but that quickly becomes tedious. There are other MSTest attributes that enable you to write a suite of similar tests.  A `[DataTestMethod]`attribute represents a suite of tests that execute the same code but have different input arguments. You can use the `[DataRow]` attribute to specify values for those inputs. \n \nInstead of creating new tests, leverage these two attributes to create a single data test method that tests several values less than two, which is the lowest prime number:\n\n[!code-csharp[Sample_TestCode](../../../samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs?name=Sample_TestCode)]\n\nRun `dotnet test`, and two of these tests fail. To make all of the tests pass, change the `if` clause at the beginning of the method:\n\n```csharp\nif (candidate < 2)\n```\n\nContinue to iterate by adding more tests, more theories, and more code in the main library. You'll end up with the [finished version of the tests](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.cs) and the [complete implementation of the library](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/master/samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-using-mstest/PrimeService/PrimeService.cs).\n\nYou've built a small library and a set of unit tests for that library. You've structured the solution so that adding new packages and tests is seamless, and you can concentrate most of your time and effort on solving the goals of the applicaiton.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,308],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Unit testing with MSTest and .NET Core | Microsoft Docs\ndescription: How to use MSTest with .NET
