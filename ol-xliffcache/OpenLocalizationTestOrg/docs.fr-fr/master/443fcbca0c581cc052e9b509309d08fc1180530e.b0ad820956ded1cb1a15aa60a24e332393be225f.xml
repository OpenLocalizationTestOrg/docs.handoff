The sample service is a simple expense approval service and exposes three operations. `ApproveExpense` takes a data contract type and shows how to use known types. The operation returns `true` or `false` based on the expense amount. `ApprovePO` takes an XmlSerializer type and returns `true` or `false` based on the expense amount.`ApprovedVendor` takes a message contract type and returns `true` or `false` if the vendor is in the list of approved vendors or if the request came from the finance department (the finance department can use any vendor).  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Load the project solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] and build the project.  \n  \n2.  First run the service, generated in [solution base directory]\\FormatterService\\bin\\debug\\  \n  \n3.  Second, run the Client application generated in [solution base directory]\\FormatterClient\\bin\\debug.  \n  \n4.  The client calls three operations on the service and prints the results. When complete, press ENTER to exit the client and then the service.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
