In this example, messages are routed to two different versions of a calculator service, `roundingCalc` (v1) and `regularCalc` (v2). Both implementations support the same operations; however the older service, `roundingCalc`, rounds all calculations to the nearest integer value before returning. A client application must be able to indicate whether to use the newer `regularCalc` service.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  In order to route a message to a specific service version, the Routing Service must be able to determine the message destination based on the message content. In the method demonstrated below, the client will specify the version by inserting information into a message header. There are methods of service versioning that do not require clients to pass additional data. For example, a message could be routed to the most recent or most compatible version of a service or the router could use a part of the standard SOAP envelope.  \n  \n The operations exposed by both services are:  \n  \n-   Add  \n  \n-   Subtract  \n  \n-   Multiply  \n  \n-   Divide  \n  \n Because both service implementations handle the same operations, and are essentially identical other than the data that they return, the base data contained in messages sent from client applications is not unique enough to allow you to determine how to route the request. For example, Action filters cannot be used because the default actions for both services are the same.  \n  \n This can be resolved in several ways, such as exposing a specific endpoint on the router for each version of the service or adding a custom header element to the message to indicate service version.  Each of these approaches allows you to uniquely route incoming messages to a specific version of the service, but utilizing unique message content is the preferred method of differentiating between requests for different service versions.  \n  \n In this example, the client application adds the ‘CalcVer’ custom header to the request message. This header will contain a value that indicates the version of the service that the message should be routed to. A value of ‘1’ indicates that the message must be processed by the roundingCalc service, while a value of ‘2’ indicates the regularCalc service. This allows the client application to directly control which version of the service will process the message.  Since the custom header is a value contained within the message, you can use one endpoint to receive messages destined for both versions of the service. The following code can be used in the client application to add this custom header to the message:  \n  \n```csharp  \nmessageHeadersElement.Add(MessageHeader.CreateHeader(\"CalcVer\", \"http://my.custom.namespace/\", \"2\"));  \n```  \n  \n### Implement Service Versioning  \n  \n1.  Create the basic Routing Service configuration by specifying the service endpoint exposed by the service. The following example defines a single service endpoint, which will be used to receive messages. It also defines the client endpoints which will be used to send messages to the `roundingCalc` (v1) and the `regularCalc` (v2) services.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <services>  \n        <service behaviorConfiguration=\"routingConfiguration\"  \n                 name=\"System.ServiceModel.Routing.RoutingService\">  \n          <host>  \n            <baseAddresses>  \n              <add baseAddress=\"http://localhost/routingservice/router\" />  \n            </baseAddresses>  \n          </host>  \n          <!--Set up the inbound endpoint for the Routing Service-->  \n          <endpoint address=\"calculator\"  \n                    binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                    name=\"routerEndpoint\"  \n                    contract=\"System.ServiceModel.Routing.IRequestReplyRouter\" />  \n        </service>  \n    </services>  \n    <client>  \n    <!--set up the destination endpoints-->  \n          <endpoint name=\"regularCalcEndpoint\"  \n                    address=\"net.tcp://localhost:9090/servicemodelsamples/service/\"  \n                    binding=\"netTcpBinding\"  \n                    contract=\"*\" />  \n  \n          <endpoint name=\"roundingCalcEndpoint\"  \n                    address=\"http://localhost:8080/servicemodelsamples/service/\"  \n                    binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                    contract=\"*\" />  \n        </client>  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Define the filters used to route messages to the destination endpoints.  For this example, the XPath filter is used to detect the value of the \"CalcVer\" custom header to determine which version the message should be routed to. An XPath filter is also used to detect messages that do not contain the \"CalcVer\" header. The following example defines the required filters and namespace table.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <!-- use the namespace table element to define a prefix for our custom namespace-->  \n    <namespaceTable>  \n      <add prefix=\"custom\" namespace=\"http://my.custom.namespace/\"/>  \n    </namespaceTable>  \n    <filters>  \n      <!--define the different message filters-->  \n      <!--define an xpath message filter to look for the  \n          custom header containing a value of 2-->  \n      <filter name=\"XPathFilterRegular\" filterType=\"XPath\"  \n              filterData=\"sm:header()/custom:CalcVer = '2'\"/>  \n      <!--define an xpath message filter to look for the  \n          custom header containing a value of 1-->  \n      <filter name=\"XPathFilterRounding\" filterType=\"XPath\"  \n              filterData=\"sm:header()/custom:CalcVer = '1'\"/>  \n       <!--define an xpath message filter to look for  \n           messages that do not contain the custom header-->  \n       <filter name=\"XPathFilterNoHeader\" filterType=\"XPath\"  \n               filterData=\"count(sm:header()/custom:CalcVer)=0\"/>  \n    </filters  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    > The s12 namespace prefix is defined by default in the namespace table, and represents the namespace `http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope`.\n  \n3.  Define the filter table, which associates each filter with a client endpoint. If the message contains the \"CalcVer\" header with a value of 1, it will be sent to the regularCalc service. If the header contains a value of 2, it will be sent to the roundingCalc service. If no header is present, the message will be routed to the regularCalc.  \n  \n     The following defines the filter table and adds the filters defined earlier.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <filterTables>  \n      <filterTable name=\"filterTable1\">  \n          <!--add the filters to the message filter table-->  \n          <!--look for the custom header = 1, and if we find it,  \n              send the message to the rounding calc endpoint-->  \n          <add filterName=\"XPathFilterRounding\" endpointName=\"roundingCalcEndpoint\"/>  \n          <!--look for the custom header = 2, and if we find it,  \n              send the message to the rounding calc endpoint-->  \n          <add filterName=\"XPathFilterRegular\" endpointName=\"regularCalcEndpoint\"/>  \n          <!--look for the absence of the custom header, and if  \n              it is not present, assume the v1 endpoint-->  \n          <add filterName=\"XPathFilterNoHeader\" endpointName=\"roundingCalcEndpoint\"/>  \n      </filterTable>  \n    </filterTables>  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  To evaluate incoming messages against the filters contained in the filter table, you must associate the filter table with the service endpoints by using the routing behavior. The following example demonstrates associating `filterTable1` with the service endpoints:  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <!--default routing service behavior definition-->  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"routingConfiguration\">  \n          <routing filterTableName=\"filterTable1\" />  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following is a complete listing of the configuration file.  \n  \n```xml  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n<!-- Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
