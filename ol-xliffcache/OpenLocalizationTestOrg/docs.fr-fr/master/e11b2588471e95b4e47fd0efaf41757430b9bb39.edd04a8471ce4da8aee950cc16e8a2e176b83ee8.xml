You can use the Registry Editor (*regedit.exe*) program to view this information.\n\n1. Open the program **regedit.exe**. In Windows 8 and later versions, right-click **Start** ![Windows logo](../get-started/media/windowskeyboardlogo.png \"Windowskeyboardlogo\"), then select **Run**. In the **Open** box, enter **regedit** and select **OK**.\n\n2. In the Registry Editor, open the following subkey:\n\n     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Updates`\n\n     The installed updates are listed under subkeys that identify the .NET Framework version they apply to. Each update is identified by a Knowledge Base (KB) number.\n\nIn the Registry Editor, the .NET Framework versions and installed updates for each version are stored in different subkeys. For information about detecting the installed version numbers, see [How to: Determine which .NET Framework versions are installed](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed.md).\n\n## To find installed updates by querying the registry in code\n\nThe following example programmatically determines the .NET Framework security updates and hotfixes that are installed on a computer:\n\n[!code-csharp[ListUpdates](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/listupdates/cs/program.cs)]\n[!code-vb[ListUpdates](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/listupdates/vb/program.vb)]\n\nThe example produces an output that's similar to the following one:\n\n```console\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile\n  KB2468871\n  KB2468871v2\n  KB2478063\n  KB2533523\n  KB2544514\n  KB2600211\n  KB2600217\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4 Extended\n  KB2468871\n  KB2468871v2\n  KB2478063\n  KB2533523\n  KB2544514\n  KB2600211\n  KB2600217\n```\n\n## To find installed updates by querying the registry in PowerShell\n\nThe following example shows how to determine the .NET Framework security updates and hotfixes that are installed on a computer using PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\n$DotNetVersions = Get-ChildItem HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Updates | Where-Object {$_.name -like\n \"*.NET Framework*\"}\n\nForEach($Version in $DotNetVersions){\n    \n   $Updates = Get-ChildItem $Version.PSPath\n    $Version.PSChildName\n    ForEach ($Update in $Updates){\n       $Update.PSChildName\n       }\n}\n```\n\nThe example produces an output that's similar to the following one:\n\n```console\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile\nKB2468871\nKB2468871v2\nKB2478063\nKB2533523\nKB2544514\nKB2600211\nKB2600217\nMicrosoft .NET Framework 4 Extended\nKB2468871\nKB2468871v2\nKB2478063\nKB2533523\nKB2544514\nKB2600211\nKB2600217\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [How to: Determine which .NET Framework versions are
