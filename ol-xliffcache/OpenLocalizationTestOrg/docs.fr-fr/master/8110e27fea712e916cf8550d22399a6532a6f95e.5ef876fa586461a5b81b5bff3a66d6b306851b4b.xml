For example, because the calculation in the following example is performed in an `unchecked` block or expression, the fact that the result is too large for an integer is ignored, and `int1` is assigned the value -2,147,483,639.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsChecked#5](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/unchecked_1.cs)]  \n  \n If the `unchecked` environment is removed, a compilation error occurs. The overflow can be detected at compile time because all the terms of the expression are constants.  \n  \n Expressions that contain non-constant terms are unchecked by default at compile time and run time. See [checked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked.md) for information about enabling a checked environment.  \n  \n Because checking for overflow takes time, the use of unchecked code in situations where there is no danger of overflow might improve performance. However, if overflow is a possibility, a checked environment should be used.  \n  \n## Example  \n This sample shows how to use the `unchecked` keyword.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsChecked#2](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/unchecked_2.cs)]  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Keywords](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md)   \n [Checked and Unchecked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked-and-unchecked.md)   \n [checked](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,580],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"unchecked (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
