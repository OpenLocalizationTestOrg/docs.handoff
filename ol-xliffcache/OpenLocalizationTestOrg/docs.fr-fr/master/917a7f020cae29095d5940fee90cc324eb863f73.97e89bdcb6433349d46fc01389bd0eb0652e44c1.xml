A service can optionally announce its availability by sending an online and offline announcement message when it is opened or closed respectively. A [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service specifies the announcement endpoints in the [\\<serviceDiscovery>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicediscovery.md) element and uses the AnnouncementClient to perform the announcements. A client wishing to listen for the announcement from other service is actually acting as a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service; thus you have to configure the announcement endpoints for that client in the [\\<services>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/services.md) section.  \n  \n \\<system.ServiceModel>  \n\\<standardEndpoints>  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n<system.serviceModel>  \n    <standardEndpoints>       <announcementEndpoint>           <standardEndpoint                  discoveryVersion=\"WSDiscovery11/WSDiscoveryApril2005\"                  maxAnnouncementDelay=\"Timespan\"                   name=\"String\" />        </announcementEndpoint>            </standardEndpoints>  \n</system.serviceModel>  \n```  \n  \n## Attributes and Elements  \n The following sections describe attributes, child elements, and parent elements.  \n  \n### Attributes  \n  \n|Attribute|Description|  \n|---------------|-----------------|  \n|discoveryVersion|A string that specifies one of the two versions of WS-Discovery protocol. Valid values are WSDiscovery11 and WSDiscoveryApril2005. This value is of type <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.Configuration.AnnouncementEndpointElement.DiscoveryVersion>.|  \n|maxAnnouncementDelay|A Timespan value that specifies the maximum value for the delay the Discovery protocol will wait before sending a Hello message. The messages will wait for a random time value between 0 and the value of this attribute before being sent. This attribute is used to set a small, random delay to prevent network storms when a network goes out and all services come back online at the same time.|  \n|name|A String that specifies the name of the configuration of the standard endpoint. The name is used in the `endpointConfiguration` attribute of the service endpoint to link a standard endpoint to its configuration.|  \n  \n### Child Elements  \n None.  \n  \n### Parent Elements  \n  \n|Element|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|[\\<standardEndpoints>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/standardendpoints.md)|A collection of standard endpoints that are pre-defined endpoints with one or more of their properties (address, binding, contract) fixed.|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates a client listening for announcements messages over http and peernet.  \n  \n```  \n  \n<services>  \n  <service name=\"ServiceAnnouncementListener\">  \n              <endpoint name=\"httpAnnouncementEndpoint\"  \n                        kind=\"announcementEndpoint\"  \n                        binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"  \n                        address=\"announcements\" />  \n              <endpoint name=\"peerNetAnnouncementEndpoint\"  \n                        kind=\"announcementEndpoint\"  \n                        binding=\"peerTcpBinding\"  \n                        address=\"net.p2p://discoveryMesh/multicast\"  \n                        bindingConfiguration=\"discoveryPeerTcpBindingConfig\" />  \n  ...  \n  </service>  \n</services>  \n  \n<standardEndpoints>  \n  <announcementEndpoint>  \n     <standardEndpoint name=\"httpAnnouncementEndpoint\"                         \n                       version=\"WSDiscoveryApril2005\" />  \n     <standardEndpoint name=\"peerNetAnnouncementEndpoint\"                         \n                       version=\"WSDiscoveryApril2005\" />  \n   </announcementEndpoint>  \n</standardEndpoints>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.AnnouncementEndpoint>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,57],"content":"&lt;announcementEndpoint&gt;
