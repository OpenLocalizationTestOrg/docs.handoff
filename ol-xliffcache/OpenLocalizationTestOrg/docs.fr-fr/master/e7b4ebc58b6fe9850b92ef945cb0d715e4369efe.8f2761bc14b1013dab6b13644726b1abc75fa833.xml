The name of the file that will contain your bug report. Enclose the file name in quotation marks (\" \") if the name contains a space.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The following information is added to `file`:  \n  \n-   A copy of all source-code files in the compilation.  \n  \n-   A list of the compiler options used in the compilation.  \n  \n-   Version information about your compiler, common language runtime, and operating system.  \n  \n-   Compiler output, if any.  \n  \n-   A description of the problem, for which you are prompted.  \n  \n-   A description of how you think the problem should be fixed, for which you are prompted.  \n  \n Because a copy of all source-code files is included in `file`, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The `-bugreport` option produces a file that contains potentially sensitive information. This includes current time, compiler version, [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] version, OS version, user name, the command-line arguments with which the compiler was run, all source code, and the binary form of any referenced assembly. This option can be accessed by specifying command-line options in the Web.config file for a server-side compilation of an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](~/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application. To prevent this, modify the Machine.config file to disallow users from compiling on the server.  \n  \n If this option is used with `-errorreport:prompt`, `-errorreport:queue`, or `-errorreport:send`, and your application encounters an internal compiler error, the information in `file` is sent to Microsoft Corporation. That information will help Microsoft engineers identify the cause of the error and may help improve the next release of Visual Basic. By default, no information is sent to Microsoft. However, when you compile an application by using `-errorreport:queue`, which is enabled by default, the application collects its error reports. Then, when the computer's administrator logs in, the error reporting system displays a pop-up window that enables the administrator to forward to Microsoft any error reports that occurred since the logon.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/bugreport` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when you compile from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example compiles `T2.vb` and puts all bug-reporting information in the file `Problem.txt`.  \n  \n```  \nvbc -bugreport:problem.txt t2.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [-debug (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/debug.md)\n- [-errorreport](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/errorreport.md)\n- [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)\n- [trustLevel Element for securityPolicy (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/as399f0x(v=vs.100))\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,257],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-bugreport\"\nms.date: 03/08/2018\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"-bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/bugreport compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: e4325406-8dbd-4b48-b311-9ee0799e48bb","nodes":[{"content":"-bugreport","nodes":[{"pos":[0,10],"content":"-bugreport","nodes":[{"content":"-bugreport","pos":[0,10]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[264,274],"content":"-bugreport","linkify":"-bugreport","nodes":[{"content":"-bugreport","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"Creates a file that you can use when you file a bug report.","pos":[275,334]},{"pos":[343,349],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[391,400],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Term","pos":[407,411]},{"content":"Definition","pos":[412,422]},{"content":"Required.","pos":[446,455]},{"content":"The name of the file that will contain your bug report.","pos":[456,511]},{"content":"Enclose the file name in quotation marks (\" \") if the name contains a space.","pos":[512,588]},{"pos":[598,605],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[609,654],"content":"The following information is added to <ph id=\"ph1\">`file`</ph>:","source":"The following information is added to `file`:"},{"content":"A copy of all source-code files in the compilation.","pos":[664,715]},{"content":"A list of the compiler options used in the compilation.","pos":[725,780]},{"content":"Version information about your compiler, common language runtime, and operating system.","pos":[790,877]},{"content":"Compiler output, if any.","pos":[887,911]},{"content":"A description of the problem, for which you are prompted.","pos":[921,978]},{"content":"A description of how you think the problem should be fixed, for which you are prompted.","pos":[988,1075]},{"pos":[1082,1232],"content":"Because a copy of all source-code files is included in <ph id=\"ph1\">`file`</ph>, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program.","source":"Because a copy of all source-code files is included in `file`, you may want to reproduce the (suspected) code defect in the shortest possible program."},{"pos":[1240,1880],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The `-bugreport` option produces a file that contains potentially sensitive information.
