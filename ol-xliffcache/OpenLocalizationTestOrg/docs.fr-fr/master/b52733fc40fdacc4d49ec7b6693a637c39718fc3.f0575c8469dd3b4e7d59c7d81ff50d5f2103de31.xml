It can find an extension method with that name, but not with a signature that matches the types you passed in with your method call.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Pass in types that match an existing extension method or class method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code generates CS1928:  \n  \n```  \n// cs1928.cs  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    static void Main()  \n    {  \n        Test t = new Test();  \n        t.M(\"hi\"); // CS1928  \n    }  \n}  \nstatic class Ext  \n{  \n    public static void M(this Test t, int i)  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This error is often accompanied by CS1503: Argument 'n': cannot convert from 'typeA' to 'typeB'.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Extension Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS1928 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1928 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1928","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1928","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'Type' does not contain a definition for 'method' and the best extension method overload 'method' has some invalid arguments.","pos":[587,712]},{"content":"This error is produced when the compiler cannot find a class member with the name of the method you have called.","pos":[719,831]},{"content":"It can find an extension method with that name, but not with a signature that matches the types you passed in with your method call.","pos":[832,964]},{"pos":[973,994],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Pass in types that match an existing extension method or class method.","pos":[1004,1074]},{"pos":[1083,1090],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code generates CS1928:","pos":[1094,1130]},{"content":"This error is often accompanied by CS1503: Argument 'n': cannot convert from 'typeA' to 'typeB'.","pos":[1381,1477]},{"pos":[1486,1494],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1498,1590],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Extension Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Extension Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md)"}]}
