Create a binding.  \n  \n2.  Build a channel factory.  \n  \n3.  Create a channel.  \n  \n4.  Send a request and read the reply.  \n  \n5.  Close all channel objects.  \n  \n#### Creating a Binding  \n Similar to the receiving case (see [Service Channel-Level Programming](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/service-channel-level-programming.md)), sending messages starts by creating a binding. This example creates a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CustomBinding?displayProperty=fullName> and adds an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement?displayProperty=fullName> to its Elements collection.  \n  \n#### Building a ChannelFactory  \n Instead of creating a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener?displayProperty=fullName>, this time we create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601?displayProperty=fullName> by calling <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory.CreateFactory%2A?displayProperty=fullName> on the binding where the type parameter is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel?displayProperty=fullName>. While channel listeners are used by the side that waits for incoming messages, channel factories are used by the side that initiates the communication to create a channel. Just like channel listeners, channel factories must be opened first before they can be used.  \n  \n#### Creating a Channel  \n We then call <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601.CreateChannel%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to create an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel>. This call takes the address of the endpoint with which we want to communicate using the new channel being created. Once we have a channel, we call Open on it to put it in a state ready for communication. Depending on the nature of the transport, this call to Open may initiate a connection with the target endpoint or may do nothing at all on the network.  \n  \n#### Sending a Request and Reading the Reply  \n Once we have an opened channel, we can create a message and use the channel’s Request method to send the request and wait for the reply to come back. When this method returns, we have a reply message that we can read to find out what the endpoint’s reply was.  \n  \n#### Closing Objects  \n To avoid leaking resources, we close objects used in communications when they are no longer required.  \n  \n The following code example shows a basic client using the channel factory to send a message and read the reply.  \n  \n
