The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> attached property of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is defined on the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>.  \n  \n The example manipulates the property value by using two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements; each element represents one of the Boolean property values. When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> property value is set to `true`, each column or row member of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DefinitionBase.SharedSizeGroup%2A> shares sizing information, regardless of the content of a row or column.  \n  \n [!code-xml[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n ...  \n  \n [!code-xml[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  \n  \n The following code-behind example handles the methods that the button <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event raises. The example writes the results of these method calls to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements that use related get methods to output the new property values as strings.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#3)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A>   \n [Panels Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/panels-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,74],"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[538,583],"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","linkify":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to share the sizing data of columns and rows between <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> elements in order to keep sizing consistent.","pos":[584,740],"source":"This example shows how to share the sizing data of columns and rows between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements in order to keep sizing consistent."},{"pos":[749,756],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example introduces two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> elements as child elements of a parent <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[760,913],"source":"The following example introduces two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements as child elements of a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A&gt;</ph> attached property of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> is defined on the parent <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[914,1098],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> attached property of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is defined on the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>."},{"content":"The example manipulates the property value by using two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> elements;
