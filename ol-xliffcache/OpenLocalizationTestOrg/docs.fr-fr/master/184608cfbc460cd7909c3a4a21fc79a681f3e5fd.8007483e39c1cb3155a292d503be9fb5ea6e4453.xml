The <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> enables you to iterate over the nodes within that node set. Once a node set is retrieved, the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> class provides a read-only, forward-only cursor to the selected set of nodes. The node set is created in document order, so calling this method moves to the next node in document order. <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> does not build a node tree of all the nodes in the set. Instead, it provides a single node window into the data, exposing the underlying node it points to as you move around in the tree. The methods and properties available from the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> class enable you to get information from the current node. For a list of the available methods and properties, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar>.  \n  \n Since an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> moves over a set of nodes created from an XPath query and moves forward only, the way to move is by using the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator.MoveNext%2A> method. The return type of this method is `Boolean`, returning `true` if it moves to the next selected node, and `false` if there are no more selected nodes. If it returns `true`, the following list shows the properties available:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator.Current%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator.CurrentPosition%2A>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator.Count%2A>  \n  \n When you are looking at a node set for the first time, a call to <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator.MoveNext%2A> must be made to position the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> on the first node of the selected set. This allows a while loop to be written.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to pass an <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathNodeIterator> to an <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslTransform> as a parameter in the <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XsltArgumentList>. The input to the code is **books.xml**, and the style sheet is **text.xsl**. The file **test.xml** is the <xref:System.Xml.XPath.XPathDocument>.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.IO  \nImports System.Xml  \nImports System.Xml.Xsl  \nImports System.Xml.XPath
