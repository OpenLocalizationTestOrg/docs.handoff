Create your assembly. For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md).  \n  \n2.  Assign a strong name to your assembly. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md).  \n  \n3.  Assign version information to your assembly. For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](../../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md).  \n  \n4.  Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md).  \n  \n5.  Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications. For more information, see [How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [Programming with Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,136],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: c30e972b-1693-4e05-b115-c31831fdf9f2","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[143,197],"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","linkify":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (C#)","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"Assemblies can be private or shared: by default, most simple programs consist of a private assembly because they are not intended to be used by other applications.","pos":[198,361]},{"pos":[368,520],"content":"In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Global Assembly Cache<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/gac.md)</ept> (GAC).","source":"In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the [Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/gac.md) (GAC)."},{"pos":[530,549],"content":"Sharing an assembly","linkify":"Sharing an assembly","nodes":[{"content":"Sharing an assembly","pos":[0,19]}]},{"content":"Create your assembly.","pos":[559,580]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Creating Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md)</ept>.","pos":[581,685],"source":" For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md)."},{"content":"Assign a strong name to your assembly.","pos":[695,733]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>.","pos":[734,887],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)."},{"content":"Assign version information to your assembly.","pos":[897,941]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Assembly Versioning<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md)</ept>.","pos":[942,1056],"source":" For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](../../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md)."},{"content":"Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache.","pos":[1066,1113]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)</ept>.","pos":[1114,1279],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)."},{"content":"Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications.","pos":[1289,1360]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md)</ept>.","pos":[1361,1510],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md)."},{"pos":[1519,1527],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1531,1600],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1603,1698],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming with Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)</ept>","source":"[Programming with Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)"}]}
