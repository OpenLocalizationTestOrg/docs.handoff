For more information about things to keep in mind when using ActiveX controls on Windows Forms, see [Considerations When Hosting an ActiveX Control on a Windows Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/considerations-when-hosting-an-activex-control-on-a-windows-form.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The Windows Forms ActiveX Control Importer (AxImp.exe) creates event arguments of a different type than expected upon importation of ActiveX dynamic link libraries.
