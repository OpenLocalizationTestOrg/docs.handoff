Communication Foundation (WCF) security features and how to use them to help secure messages.  \n  \n For more information about Windows Server AppFabric and security, see [Security Model for Windows Server AppFabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-overview.md)  \n Describes the security features in WCF.  \n  \n [Security Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-concepts.md)  \n Describes the basic terminology and concepts used in WCF security.  \n  \n [Common Security Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/common-security-scenarios.md)  \n Describes scenarios and topologies you can configure with WCF.  \n  \n [Security Behaviors](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-behaviors-in-wcf.md)  \n Provides an overview of WCF behaviors that affect security, such as setting credentials.  \n  \n [Bindings and Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/bindings-and-security.md)  \n A security-oriented view of the bindings, including topics that demonstrate how to create custom security bindings.  \n  \n [Securing Services and Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-services-and-clients.md)  \n Describes how to secure messages using WCF security features.  \n  \n [Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authentication-in-wcf.md)  \n Demonstrates common authentication tasks.  \n  \n [Authorization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/authorization-in-wcf.md)  \n Describes common authorization scenarios with security implementations.  \n  \n [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)  \n Describes the basics of federation and how to create clients that communicate with federated servers.  \n  \n [Partial Trust](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust.md)  \n Describes how to run partially-trusted scenarios and WCF limitations when running partially trusted.  \n  \n [Auditing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/auditing-security-events.md)  \n Describes how to audit security events.  \n  \n [Security Guidance and Best Practices](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-guidance-and-best-practices.md)  \n Guidelines for creating secure WCF applications.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
