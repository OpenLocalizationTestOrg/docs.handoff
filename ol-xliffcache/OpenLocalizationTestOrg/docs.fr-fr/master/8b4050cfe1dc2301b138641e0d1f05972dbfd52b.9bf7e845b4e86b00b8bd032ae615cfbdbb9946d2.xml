When invoking a two-way operation in a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service, the service can be either a traditional imperative code-based [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service or it can be a workflow service. To use request-reply correlation a two-way binding must be used, such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>. Whether invoking or implementing a two-way operation, the correlation initialization steps are similar and are covered in this section.  \n  \n## Using Correlation in a Two-Way Operation with Receive/SendReply  \n A <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is used to implement a two-way operation in a workflow service. The runtime uses request-reply correlation to ensure that the reply is dispatched to the correct caller. When a workflow is hosted using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, which is the case for workflow services, then the default correlation initialization is sufficient. In this scenario, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is used by a workflow, and no specific correlation configuration is required.  \n  \n```csharp  \nReceive StartOrder = new Receive  \n{  \n    CanCreateInstance = true,  \n    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  \n    OperationName = \"StartOrder\"  \n};  \n  \nSendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  \n{  \n    Request = StartOrder,  \n    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  \n};  \n  \n// Construct a workflow using StartOrder and ReplyToStartOrder.  \n  \n```  \n  \n### Explicitly Initializing Request-Reply Correlation  \n If other two-way operations are in parallel, then correlation should be explicitly configured. This can be done by specifying a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.RequestReplyCorrelationInitializer>, or by placing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> inside of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>. In this example, request-reply correlation is configured on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair.  \n  \n```csharp  \nVariable<CorrelationHandle> RRHandle = new Variable<CorrelationHandle>();  \n  \nReceive StartOrder = new Receive  \n{  \n    CanCreateInstance = true,  \n    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  \n    OperationName = \"StartOrder\",  \n    CorrelationInitializers =  \n    {  \n        new RequestReplyCorrelationInitializer  \n        {  \n            CorrelationHandle = RRHandle  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n  \nSendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  \n{  \n    Request = StartOrder,  \n    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  \n};  \n  \n// Construct a workflow using StartOrder and ReplyToStartOrder.  \n```  \n  \n Instead of explicitly configuring the correlation, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> activity can be used. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope> provides an implicit <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle> to the messaging activities that it contains. In this example, a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendReply> pair is contained inside a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>. No explicit correlation configuration is required.  \n  \n```csharp  \nReceive StartOrder = new Receive  \n{  \n    CanCreateInstance = true,  \n    ServiceContractName = OrderContractName,  \n    OperationName = \"StartOrder\"  \n};  \n  \nSendReply ReplyToStartOrder = new SendReply  \n{  \n    Request = StartOrder,  \n    Content = … // Contains the return value, if any.  \n};  \n  \nCorrelationScope s = new CorrelationScope  \n{  \n    Body = new Sequence  \n    {  \n        Activities =   \n        {  \n            StartOrder,  \n            // Activities that create the reply.  \n            ReplyToStartOrder  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n  \n// Construct a workflow using the CorrelationScope.  \n```  \n  \n If additional correlations are required then they can be configured using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send.CorrelationInitializers%2A> property of the respective messaging activities using the desired `CorrelationInitializer` types.  \n  \n## Using Correlation in a Two-Way Operation with Send/ReceiveReply  \n While the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity can only be used in a workflow service hosted by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair can be used in any workflow that must invoke a method on a Web service. If the workflow is hosted using <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost> then the default correlation described in the previous section applies, but if not, then correlation must be configured either explicitly using the desired <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationInitializer> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationHandle>, or by using the implicit handle management of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.CorrelationScope>.  \n  \n When using **Add Service Reference** on a service with two-way operations, activities are generated that wrap a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send>/<xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveReply> pair activity internally with the Request/Reply correlation explicitly specified.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"Request-Reply Correlation | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Request-Reply Correlation | Microsoft
