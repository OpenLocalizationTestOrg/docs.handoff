This is not allowed, since a nested class cannot be CLS-compliant if it is a member of an outer class that is not CLS-compliant. To resolve this warning, remove the CLSCompliant attribute from the nested class, or change it from `true` to `false`. For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md).\n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS3018.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS3018.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \nusing System;  \n  \n[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]  \n[CLSCompliant(false)]  \npublic class Outer  \n{  \n   [CLSCompliant(true)]   // CS3018  \n   public class Nested {}  \n  \n   // OK  \n   public class Nested2 {}  \n  \n   [CLSCompliant(false)]  \n   public class Nested3 {}  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS3018\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS3018\"\nms.assetid: 35d2f4bd-10c3-4e9f-8e02-389ab84db2cd","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS3018","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"'type' cannot be marked as CLS-Compliant because it is a member of non CLS-compliant type 'type'","pos":[218,314]},{"content":"This warning occurs if a nested class with the CLSCompliant attribute set to <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> is declared as a member of a class declared with the CLSCompliant attribute set to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","pos":[321,496],"source":"This warning occurs if a nested class with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `true` is declared as a member of a class declared with the CLSCompliant attribute set to `false`."},{"content":"This is not allowed, since a nested class cannot be CLS-compliant if it is a member of an outer class that is not CLS-compliant.","pos":[497,625]},{"content":"To resolve this warning, remove the CLSCompliant attribute from the nested class, or change it from <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","pos":[626,744],"source":" To resolve this warning, remove the CLSCompliant attribute from the nested class, or change it from `true` to `false`."},{"content":"For more information on CLS compliance, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language independence and language-independent components<ept id=\"p1\">](../../standard/language-independence.md)</ept>.","pos":[745,890],"source":" For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md)."},{"pos":[897,904],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS3018.","pos":[908,946]}]}
