The following table shows the `DataAdapter` events.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|`RowUpdating`|An UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operation on a row (by a call to one of the `Update` methods) is about to begin.|  \n|`RowUpdated`|An UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE operation on a row (by a call to one of the `Update` methods) is complete.|  \n|`FillError`|An error has occurred during a `Fill` operation.|  \n  \n## RowUpdating and RowUpdated  \n `RowUpdating` is raised before any update to a row from the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> has been processed at the data source. `RowUpdated` is raised after any update to a row from the `DataSet` has been processed at the data source. As a result, you can use `RowUpdating` to modify update behavior before it happens, to provide additional handling when an update will occur, to retain a reference to an updated row, to cancel the current update and schedule it for a batch process to be processed later, and so on. `RowUpdated` is useful for responding to errors and exceptions that occur during the update. You can add error information to the `DataSet`, as well as retry logic, and so on.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Data.Common.RowUpdatingEventArgs> and <xref:System.Data.Common.RowUpdatedEventArgs> arguments passed to the `RowUpdating` and `RowUpdated` events include the following: a `Command` property that references the `Command` object being used to perform the update; a `Row` property that references the `DataRow` object containing the updated information; a `StatementType` property for what type of update is being performed; the `TableMapping`, if applicable; and the `Status` of the operation.  \n  \n You can use the `Status` property to determine if an error has occurred during the operation and, if desired, to control the actions against the current and resulting rows. When the event occurs, the `Status` property equals either `Continue` or `ErrorsOccurred`. The following table shows the values to which you can set the `Status` property in order to control later actions during the update.  \n  \n|Status|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|`Continue`|Continue the update operation.|  \n|`ErrorsOccurred`|Abort the update operation and throw an exception.|  \n|`SkipCurrentRow`|Ignore the current row and continue the update operation.|  \n|`SkipAllRemainingRows`|Abort the update operation but do not throw an exception.|  \n  \n Setting the `Status` property to `ErrorsOccurred` causes an exception to be thrown. You can control which exception is thrown by setting the `Errors` property to the desired exception. Using one of the other values for `Status` prevents an exception from being thrown.  \n  \n You can also use the `ContinueUpdateOnError` property to handle errors for updated rows. If `DataAdapter.ContinueUpdateOnError` is `true`, when an update to a row results in an exception being thrown, the text of the exception is placed into the `RowError` information of the particular row, and processing continues without throwing an exception. This enables you to respond to errors when the `Update` is complete, in contrast to the `RowUpdated` event, which enables you to respond to errors when the error is encountered.  \n  \n The following code sample shows how to both add and remove event handlers. The `RowUpdating` event handler writes a log of all deleted records with a time stamp. The `RowUpdated` event handler adds error information to the `RowError` property of the row in the `DataSet`, suppresses the exception, and continues processing (mirroring the behavior of `ContinueUpdateOnError` = `true`).  \n  \n```vb  \n' Assumes that connection is a valid SqlConnection object.  \nDim custAdapter As SqlDataAdapter = New SqlDataAdapter( _  \n  \"SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers\", connection)  \n  \n' Add handlers.  \nAddHandler custAdapter.RowUpdating, New SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler( _  \n  AddressOf OnRowUpdating)  \nAddHandler custAdapter.RowUpdated, New SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(  \n  AddressOf OnRowUpdated)  \n  \n' Set DataAdapter command properties, fill DataSet, and modify DataSet.  \n  \ncustAdapter.Update(custDS, \"Customers\")  \n  \n' Remove handlers.  \nRemoveHandler custAdapter.RowUpdating, _  \n  New SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(AddressOf OnRowUpdating)  \nRemoveHandler custAdapter.RowUpdated, _  \n  New SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(AddressOf OnRowUpdated)  \n  \nPrivate Shared Sub OnRowUpdating(sender As Object, _  \n  args As SqlRowUpdatingEventArgs)  \n  If args.StatementType = StatementType.Delete Then  \n    Dim tw As System.IO.TextWriter = _  \n  System.IO.File.AppendText(\"Deletes.log\")  \n    tw.WriteLine( _  \n      \"{0}: Customer {1} Deleted.\", DateTime.Now, args.Row(_  \n      \"CustomerID\", DataRowVersion.Original))  \n    tw.Close()  \n  End If  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nPrivate Shared Sub OnRowUpdated( _  \n  sender As Object, args As SqlRowUpdatedEventArgs)  \n  If args.Status = UpdateStatus.ErrorsOccurred  \n    args.Status = UpdateStatus.SkipCurrentRow  \n    args.Row.RowError = args.Errors.Message  \n  End If  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Assumes that connection is a valid SqlConnection object.  \nSqlDataAdapter custAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(  \n  \"SELECT CustomerID, CompanyName FROM Customers\", connection);  \n  \n// Add handlers.  \ncustAdapter.RowUpdating += new SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(OnRowUpdating);  \ncustAdapter.RowUpdated += new SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(OnRowUpdated);  \n  \n// Set DataAdapter command properties, fill DataSet, modify DataSet.  \n  \ncustAdapter.Update(custDS, \"Customers\");  \n  \n// Remove handlers.  \ncustAdapter.RowUpdating -= new SqlRowUpdatingEventHandler(OnRowUpdating);  \ncustAdapter.RowUpdated -= new SqlRowUpdatedEventHandler(OnRowUpdated);  \n  \nprotected static void OnRowUpdating(  \n  object sender, SqlRowUpdatingEventArgs args)  \n{  \n  if (args.StatementType == StatementType.Delete)  \n  {  \n    System.IO.TextWriter tw = System.IO.File.AppendText(\"Deletes.log\");  \n    tw.WriteLine(  \n      \"{0}: Customer {1} Deleted.\", DateTime.Now,   \n       args.Row[\"CustomerID\", DataRowVersion.Original]);  \n    tw.Close();  \n  }  \n}  \n  \nprotected static void OnRowUpdated(  \n  object sender, SqlRowUpdatedEventArgs args)  \n{  \n  if (args.Status == UpdateStatus.ErrorsOccurred)  \n  {  \n    args.Row.RowError = args.Errors.Message;  \n    args.Status = UpdateStatus.SkipCurrentRow;  \n  }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## FillError  \n The `DataAdapter` issues the `FillError` event when an error occurs during a `Fill` operation. This type of error commonly occurs when the data in the row being added could not be converted to a .NET Framework type without some loss of precision.  \n  \n If an error occurs during a `Fill` operation, the current row is not added to the `DataTable`. The `FillError` event enables you to resolve the error and add the row, or to ignore the excluded row and continue the `Fill` operation.  \n  \n The `FillErrorEventArgs` passed to the `FillError` event can contain several properties that enable you to respond to and resolve errors. The following table shows the properties of the `FillErrorEventArgs` object.  \n  \n|Property|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|  \n|`Errors`|The `Exception` that occurred.|  \n|`DataTable`|The `DataTable` object being filled when the error occurred.|  \n|`Values`|An array of objects that contains the values of the row being added when the error occurred. The ordinal references of the `Values` array correspond to the ordinal references of the columns of the row being added. For example, `Values[0]` is the value that was being added as the first column of the row.|  \n|`Continue`|Allows you to choose whether or not to throw an exception. Setting the `Continue` property to `false` will halt the current `Fill` operation, and an exception will be thrown. Setting `Continue` to `true` continues the `Fill` operation despite the error.|  \n  \n The following code example adds an event handler for the `FillError` event of the `DataAdapter`. In the `FillError` event code, the example determines if there is the potential for precision loss, providing the opportunity to respond to the exception.  \n  \n```vb  \nAddHandler adapter.FillError, New FillErrorEventHandler( _  \n  AddressOf FillError)  \n  \nDim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \nadapter.Fill(dataSet, \"ThisTable\")  \n  \nPrivate Shared Sub FillError(sender As Object, _  \n  args As FillErrorEventArgs)  \n  If args.Errors.GetType() Is Type.GetType(\"System.OverflowException\") Then  \n    ' Code to handle precision loss.  \n    ' Add a row to table using the values from the first two columns.  \n    DataRow myRow = args.DataTable.Rows.Add(New Object() _  \n      {args.Values(0), args.Values(1), DBNull.Value})  \n    ' Set the RowError containing the value for the third column.  \n    args.RowError = _  \n      \"OverflowException encountered. Value from data source: \" & _  \n      args.Values(2)  \n    args.Continue = True  \n  End If  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nadapter.FillError += new FillErrorEventHandler(FillError);  \n  \nDataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \nadapter.Fill(dataSet, \"ThisTable\");  \n  \nprotected static void FillError(object sender, FillErrorEventArgs args)  \n{  \n  if (args.Errors.GetType() == typeof(System.OverflowException))  \n  {  \n    // Code to handle precision loss.  \n    //Add a row to table using the values from the first two columns.  \n    DataRow myRow = args.DataTable.Rows.Add(new object[]  \n       {args.Values[0], args.Values[1], DBNull.Value});  \n    //Set the RowError containing the value for the third column.  \n    args.RowError =   \n       \"OverflowException Encountered. Value from data source: \" +  \n       args.Values[2];  \n    args.Continue = true;  \n  }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DataAdapters and
