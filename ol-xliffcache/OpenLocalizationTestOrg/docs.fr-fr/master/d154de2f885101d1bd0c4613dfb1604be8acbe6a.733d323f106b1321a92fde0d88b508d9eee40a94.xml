This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable ([!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]) host applications.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets#IsBrowserHostedCODE](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets/CSharp/Page1.xaml.cs#isbrowserhostedcode)]\n [!code-vb[HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets#IsBrowserHostedCODE](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets/visualbasic/page1.xaml.vb#isbrowserhostedcode)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,258],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"hosted pages in browser [WPF]\"\n  - \"pages [WPF], hosted in browser\"\nms.assetid: 737e0f26-8371-49b4-9579-70879e51e1aa","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[265,310],"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","linkify":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","pos":[0,45]}]},{"pos":[311,418],"content":"This example demonstrates how to determine if a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is hosted in a browser.","source":"This example demonstrates how to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser."},{"pos":[427,434],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> can be host agnostic and, consequently, can be loaded into several different types of hosts, including a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame&gt;</ph>, a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow&gt;</ph>, or a browser.","pos":[438,685],"source":"A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can be host agnostic and, consequently, can be loaded into several different types of hosts, including a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, or a browser."},{"content":"This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable (<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]</ph>) host applications.","pos":[686,919],"source":" This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable ([!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]) host applications."},{"pos":[926,1148],"content":"The following example demonstrates how to use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> to determine if a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is hosted in a browser.","source":"The following example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser."},{"pos":[1546,1554],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
