The following examples use different types of animations to affect the display of text in a              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses a                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the width of the text block. The width value changes from the width of the text block to 0 over a duration of 10 seconds, and then reverses the width values and continues. This type of animation creates a wipe effect.  \n  \n [!code-xml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample1)]  \n  \n The following example uses a                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> to animate the opacity of the text block. The opacity value changes from 1.0 to 0 over a duration of 5 seconds, and then reverses the opacity values and continues.  \n  \n [!code-xml[TextAnimationSample#TextAnimationSample2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextAnimationSample/CS/Window1.xaml#textanimationsample2)]  \n  \n The following diagram shows the effect of the                      <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control changing its opacity from                      `1.00` to                      `0.00` during the 5-second interval defined by the                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Timeline.Duration%2A>.  \n  \n ![Text changing opacity from 1.00 to 0.00](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/fadedtext01.png \"FadedText01\")  \nText Opacity changing from 1.00 to 0.00  \n  \n The following example uses a                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.ColorAnimation> to animate the foreground color of the text block.

The text block performs a full rotation over a duration of 20 seconds, and then continues to repeat the rotation.  \n  \n
