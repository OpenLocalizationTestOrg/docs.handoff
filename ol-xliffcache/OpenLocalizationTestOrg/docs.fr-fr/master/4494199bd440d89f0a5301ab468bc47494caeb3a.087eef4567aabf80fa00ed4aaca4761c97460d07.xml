(This does not affect stylus input.)\n\n  - Drag/Drop can no longer be initiated on touch/stylus events.\n\n      This can potentially hang the application until mouse input is detected. Instead, developers should initiate drag and drop from mouse events.\n\n## Opting in to WM_POINTER-based touch/stylus support\n\nDevelopers who wish to enable this stack can add the following to their application's app.config file:\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n    <runtime>\n        <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Windows.Input.Stylus.EnablePointerSupport=true\"/>\n    </runtime>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nRemoving this entry or setting its value to `false` turns this optional stack off.\n\n## See also\n\n[Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,79],"content":"Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]},{"pos":[519,569],"content":"Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support","linkify":"Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support","nodes":[{"content":"Mitigation: Pointer-based Touch and Stylus Support","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[571,764],"content":"WPF applications that target the .NET Framework 4.7 and are running on Windows Systems starting with Windows 10 Creators Update can enable an optional <ph id=\"ph1\">`WM_POINTER`</ph>-based WPF touch/stylus stack.","source":"WPF applications that target the .NET Framework 4.7 and are running on Windows Systems starting with Windows 10 Creators Update can enable an optional `WM_POINTER`-based WPF touch/stylus stack."},{"pos":[769,775],"content":"Impact","linkify":"Impact","nodes":[{"content":"Impact","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"Developers who do not explicitly enable pointer-based touch/stylus support should see no change in WPF touch/stylus behavior.","pos":[777,902]},{"pos":[904,999],"content":"The following are current known issues with the optional <ph id=\"ph1\">`WM_POINTER`</ph>-based touch/stylus stack:","source":"The following are current known issues with the optional `WM_POINTER`-based touch/stylus stack:"},{"content":"No support for real-time inking.","pos":[1003,1035]},{"content":"While inking and stylus plugins still work, they are processed on the UI thread, which can lead to poor performance.","pos":[1040,1156]},{"content":"Behavioral changes due to changes in promotion from touch/stylus events to mouse events.","pos":[1160,1248]},{"content":"Manipulation may behave differently.","pos":[1254,1290]},{"content":"Drag/Drop will not show appropriate feedback for touch input.","pos":[1296,1357]},{"content":"(This does not affect stylus input.)","pos":[1358,1394]},{"content":"Drag/Drop can no longer be initiated on touch/stylus events.","pos":[1400,1460]},{"content":"This can potentially hang the application until mouse input is detected.","pos":[1468,1540]},{"content":"Instead, developers should initiate drag and drop from mouse events.","pos":[1541,1609]},{"pos":[1614,1664],"content":"Opting in to WM_POINTER-based touch/stylus support","linkify":"Opting in to WM_POINTER-based touch/stylus support","nodes":[{"content":"Opting in to WM_POINTER-based touch/stylus support","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"Developers who wish to enable this stack can add the following to their application's app.config file:","pos":[1666,1768]},{"pos":[1950,2032],"content":"Removing this entry or setting its value to <ph id=\"ph1\">`false`</ph> turns this optional stack off.","source":"Removing this entry or setting its value to `false` turns this optional stack off."},{"pos":[2037,2045],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2047,2183],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)</ept>","source":"[Retargeting Changes in the .NET Framework 4.7](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/retargeting-changes-in-the-net-framework-4-7.md)"}]}
