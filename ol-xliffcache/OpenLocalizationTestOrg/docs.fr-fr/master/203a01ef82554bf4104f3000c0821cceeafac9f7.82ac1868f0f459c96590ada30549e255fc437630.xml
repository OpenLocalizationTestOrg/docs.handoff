For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To copy and paste an ElementHost control at design time  \n  \n1.  Add a new WPF <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> to your Windows Forms project. Use the default name for the control type, `UserControl1.xaml`. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md).  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties of `UserControl1` to `200`.  \n  \n3.  Set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> property to `Blue`.  \n  \n4.  Build the project.  \n  \n5.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n6.  From the **Toolbox**, drag an instance of `UserControl1` onto the form.  \n  \n     An instance of `UserControl1` is hosted in a new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost1`.  \n  \n7.  With `elementHost1` selected, press CTRL+C to copy it to the clipboard.  \n  \n8.  Press CTRL+V to paste the copied control onto the form.  \n  \n     A new <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control named `elementHost2` is created on the form.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>\n- [Migration and Interoperability](../../wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)\n- [Using WPF Controls](using-wpf-controls.md)\n- [Design XAML in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/designers/designing-xaml-in-visual-studio)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,387],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Forms, content copying and pasting\"\n  - \"interoperability [WPF]\"\n  - \"ElementHost control [Windows Forms], copying and pasting at design time\"\n  - \"WPF user control [Windows Forms], hosting in Windows Forms\"\nms.assetid: e570375d-2a68-44ba-b4f7-c781af2d20e8","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","pos":[0,60]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[394,454],"content":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","linkify":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"This procedure shows you how to copy a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control on a Windows Form.","pos":[455,558]},{"pos":[566,911],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
