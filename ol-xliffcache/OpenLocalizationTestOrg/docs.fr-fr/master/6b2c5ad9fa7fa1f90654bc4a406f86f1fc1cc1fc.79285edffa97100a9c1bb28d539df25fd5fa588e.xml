These events are designed so that you can paint only what you want to while letting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control paint the rest. For example, if you want to paint a custom background, you can handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> event and let the individual cells paint their own foreground content. Alternately, you can let the cells paint themselves and add custom foreground content in a handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPostPaint?displayProperty=fullName> event. You can also disable cell painting and paint everything yourself in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.RowPrePaint?displayProperty=fullName> event handler.  \n  \n The following code example implements handlers for both events in order to provide a gradient selection background and some custom foreground content that spans multiple columns.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting#00](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting/CS/datagridviewrowpainting.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting#00](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewRowPainting/VB/datagridviewrowpainting.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
