For example, Microsoft Word documents contain an icon that identifies them as Word documents. When displaying files in a list control or table control, you may want to display the icon representing the file type next to each file name. You can do this easily by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to extract the icon associated with a file and display the file name and its associated icon in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIconEx/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To compile the example:  \n  \n-   Paste the preceding code into a Windows Form, and call the `ExtractAssociatedIconExample` method from the form's constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event-handling method.  \n  \n     You will need to make sure that your form imports the <xref:System.IO> namespace.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)\n- [ListView Control](../controls/listview-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,435],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"displaying a file name and its file type icon in a ListView control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"file name extension icons [Windows Forms], displaying in a ListView\"\n  - \"extracting icons associated with a file type [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 88e2ad8b-c34f-415a-84f2-dad756b5c928","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[442,506],"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Extract the Icon Associated with a File in Windows Forms","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"Many files have embedded icons that provide a visual representation of the associated file type.","pos":[507,603]},{"content":"For example, Microsoft Word documents contain an icon that identifies them as Word documents.","pos":[604,697]},{"content":"When displaying files in a list control or table control, you may want to display the icon representing the file type next to each file name.","pos":[698,839]},{"content":"You can do this easily by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[840,935],"source":" You can do this easily by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon%2A> method."},{"pos":[944,951],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[955,1142],"content":"The following code example demonstrates how to extract the icon associated with a file and display the file name and its associated icon in a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control.","source":"The following code example demonstrates how to extract the icon associated with a file and display the file name and its associated icon in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control."},{"pos":[1495,1513],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"To compile the example:","pos":[1517,1540]},{"pos":[1550,1738],"content":"Paste the preceding code into a Windows Form, and call the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ExtractAssociatedIconExample`</ph> method from the form's constructor or <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load&gt;</ph> event-handling method.","source":"Paste the preceding code into a Windows Form, and call the `ExtractAssociatedIconExample` method from the form's constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event-handling method."},{"pos":[1749,1830],"content":"You will need to make sure that your form imports the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO&gt;</ph> namespace.","source":"You will need to make sure that your form imports the <xref:System.IO> namespace."},{"pos":[1839,1847],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1851,1916],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles<ept id=\"p1\">](images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)</ept>","source":"[Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)"},{"pos":[1919,1984],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ListView Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../controls/listview-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[ListView Control](../controls/listview-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
