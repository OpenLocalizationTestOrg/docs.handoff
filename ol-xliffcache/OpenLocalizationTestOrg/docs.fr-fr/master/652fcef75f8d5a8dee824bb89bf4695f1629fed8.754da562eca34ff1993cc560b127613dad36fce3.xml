However, this topic concentrates on the three common security modes: <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.Transport>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.Message>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential>.  \n  \n Note that not every predefined binding supports all of these modes. This topic sets the mode with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> classes and demonstrates how to set the mode both programmatically and through configuration.  \n  \n For more information, see WCF security, see [Security Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-overview.md), [Securing Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/securing-services.md), and [Securing Services and Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/securing-services-and-clients.md). For more information about transport mode and message, see [Transport Security](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security.md) and [Message Security](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-in-wcf.md).  \n  \n### To set the security mode in code  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the binding class that you are using. For a list of predefined bindings, see [System-Provided Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md). This example creates an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> class.  \n  \n2.  Set the `Mode` property of the object returned by the `Security` property.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n     Alternatively, set the mode to message, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#2)]  \n  \n     Or set the mode to transport with message credentials, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#3)]  \n  \n3.  You can also set the mode in the constructor of the binding, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Setting the ClientCredentialType Property  \n Setting the mode to one of the three values determines how you set the `ClientCredentialType` property. For example, using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> class, setting the mode to `Transport` means you must set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpTransportSecurity.ClientCredentialType%2A> property of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpTransportSecurity> class to an appropriate value.  \n  \n#### To set the ClientCredentialType property for Transport mode  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the binding.  \n  \n2.  Set the `Mode` property to `Transport`.  \n  \n3.  Set the `ClientCredential` property to an appropriate value. The following code sets the property to `Windows`.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#5)]  \n  \n#### To set the ClientCredentialType property for Message mode  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of the binding.  \n  \n2.  Set the `Mode` property to `Message`.  \n  \n3.  Set the `ClientCredential` property to an appropriate value. The following code sets the property to `Certificate`.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_SettingSecurityMode#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/cs/source.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[c_SettingSecurityMode#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_settingsecuritymode/vb/source.vb#6)]  \n  \n#### To set the Mode and ClientCredentialType property in configuration  \n  \n1.  Add an appropriate binding element to the [\\<bindings>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/bindings.md) element of the configuration file. The following example adds a [\\<wsHttpBinding>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md) element.  \n  \n2.  Add a `<binding>` element and set its `name` attribute to an appropriate value.  \n  \n3.  Add a `<security>` element and set the `mode` attribute to `Message`, `Transport`, or `TransportWithMessageCredential`.  \n  \n4.  If the mode is set to `Transport`, add a `<transport>` element and set the `clientCredential` attribute to an appropriate value.  \n  \n     The following example sets the mode to \"`Transport\"`, and then sets the `clientCredentialType` attribute of the `<transport>` element to \"`Windows\"`.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <wsHttpBinding>  \n    <binding name=\"TransportSecurity\">  \n        <security mode=\"Transport\" >  \n           <transport clientCredentialType = \"Windows\" />  \n        </security>  \n    </binding>  \n    </wsHttpBinding >  \n    ```  \n  \n     Alternatively, set the `security mode` to \"`Message\"`, followed by a `<\"message\">` element. This example sets the `clientCredentialType` to \"`Certificate\"`.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <wsHttpBinding>  \n    <binding name=\"MessageSecurity\">  \n        <security mode=\"Message\" >  \n           <message clientCredentialType = \"Certificate\" />  \n        </security>  \n    </binding>  \n    </wsHttpBinding >  \n    ```  \n  \n     Using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurityMode.TransportWithMessageCredential> value is a special case, and is explained below.  \n  \n### Using TransportWithMessageCredential  \n When setting the security mode to `TransportWithMessageCredential`, the transport determines the actual mechanism that provides the transport-level security. For example, the HTTP protocol uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) over HTTP (HTTPS). Therefore, setting the `ClientCredentialType` property of any transport security object (such as <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpTransportSecurity>) is ignored.  In other words, you can only set the `ClientCredentialType` of the message security object (for the `WSHttpBinding` binding, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NonDualMessageSecurityOverHttp> object).  \n
