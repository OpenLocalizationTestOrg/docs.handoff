This path is not verified until it is loaded. Enclose the directory name in quotation marks (\" \") if it contains a space.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n This option tells the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler to load the Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll files from a non-default location. The `/sdkpath` option was designed to be used with [/netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md). The [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `/sdkpath` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line. The `/sdkpath` option is set when a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] device project is loaded.  \n  \n You can specify that the compiler should compile without a reference to the Visual Basic Runtime Library by using the `/vbruntime` compiler option. For more information, see [/vbruntime](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/vbruntime.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `Myfile.vb` with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)], using the versions of Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll found in the default installation directory of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] on the C drive. Typically, you would use the most recent version of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)].  \n  \n```  \nvbc /netcf /sdkpath:\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\\CompactFrameworkSDK\\v1.0.5000\\Windows CE \" myfile.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)   \n [/netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)   \n [/vbruntime](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/vbruntime.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,37],"content":"/sdkpath | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"/sdkpath | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,25]}]},{"pos":[699,707],"content":"/sdkpath","linkify":"/sdkpath","nodes":[{"content":"/sdkpath","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Specifies the location of Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll.","pos":[708,777]},{"pos":[786,792],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[832,841],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"The directory containing the versions of Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll to use for compilation.","pos":[855,962]},{"content":"This path is not verified until it is loaded.","pos":[963,1008]},{"content":"Enclose the directory name in quotation marks (\" \") if it contains a space.","pos":[1009,1084]},{"pos":[1093,1100],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This option tells the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]</ph> compiler to load the Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll files from a non-default location.","pos":[1104,1314],"source":"This option tells the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler to load the Mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll files from a non-default location."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`/sdkpath`</ph> option was designed to be used with <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/netcf<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)</ept>.","pos":[1315,1439],"source":" The `/sdkpath` option was designed to be used with [/netcf](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/netcf.md)."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)]</ph> uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices.","pos":[1440,1666],"source":" The [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] uses different versions of these support libraries to avoid the use of types and language features not found on the devices."},{"pos":[1674,1989],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `/sdkpath` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.
