The topics in this section go into detail about the available features. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] basic programming, see [Basic WCF Programming](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/basic-wcf-programming.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Workflow Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-services.md)  \n Describes how to create and configure workflow services.  \n  \n [Endpoints: Addresses, Bindings, and Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/endpoints-addresses-bindings-and-contracts.md)  \n Describes how to control multiple aspects of your service.  \n  \n [Data Transfer and Serialization](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/data-transfer-and-serialization.md)  \n Describes how serialization of data can be tailored for interoperation or future compatibility.  \n  \n [Sessions, Instancing, and Concurrency](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/sessions-instancing-and-concurrency.md)  \n Describes the instancing and session modes of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and how to select the right mode for your application.  \n  \n [Transports](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transports.md)  \n Describes how to configure the transport layer, the lowest level of the channel stack.  \n  \n [Queues and Reliable Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/queues-and-reliable-sessions.md)  \n Describes queues, which store messages from a sending application on behalf of a receiving application and later forward these messages to the receiving application.  \n  \n [Transactions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transactions-in-wcf.md)  \n Explains how to create transacted operations that can be rolled back if needed.  \n  \n [Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security.md)  \n Describes how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] security helps you to create applications that have confidentiality and integrity. Authentication and authorization are also available, as are auditing features.  \n  \n [Peer-to-Peer Networking](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/peer-to-peer-networking.md)  \n Details how to create peer services and clients.  \n  \n [Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/metadata.md)  \n Describes metadata architecture and formats.  \n  \n [Clients](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/clients.md)  \n Describes how to create a variety of clients that access services.  \n  \n [Hosting](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting.md)  \n Describes hosting. A service can be hosted by another application, or it can be self-hosted.  \n  \n [Interoperability and Integration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/interoperability-and-integration.md)  \n Describes how to use [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] to extend your existing logic rather than having to rewrite it if you have a substantial investment in component-based application logic hosted in COM+.  \n  \n [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-model.md)  \n Describes the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Web Programming Model that allows developers to expose [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service operations to non-SOAP endpoints.  \n  \n [WCF Syndication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-syndication.md)  \n Describes support to easily expose syndication feeds from a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n [AJAX Integration and JSON Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/ajax-integration-and-json-support.md)  \n Describes support for ASP.NET Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format to allow [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services to expose operations to AJAX clients.  \n  \n [WCF Discovery](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-discovery.md)  \n Describes support to enable services to be discoverable at runtime in an interoperable way using the WS-Discovery protocol.  \n  \n [Routing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/routing.md)  \n Describes the routing service.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
