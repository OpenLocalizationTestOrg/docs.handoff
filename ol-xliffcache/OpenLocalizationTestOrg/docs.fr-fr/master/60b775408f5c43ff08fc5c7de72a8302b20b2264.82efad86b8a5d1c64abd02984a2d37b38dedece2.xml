When a user drags an item to a point between two other items, the insertion mark shows the item's expected new location.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The insertion mark feature is available only on [!INCLUDE[WinXpFamily](../../../../includes/winxpfamily-md.md)] when your application calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.EnableVisualStyles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method. On earlier operating systems, any code relating to the insertion mark has no effect and the insertion mark will not appear. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListViewInsertionMark>.  \n  \n The following image shows an insertion mark:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that shows a ListView insertion mark.](./media/how-to-display-an-insertion-mark-in-a-windows-forms-listview-control/listview-insertion-mark.gif \"ListViewInsertion\")  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates how to use this feature.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/CPP/listviewinsertionmarkexample.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/CS/listviewinsertionmarkexample.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ListView.InsertionMark/VB/listviewinsertionmarkexample.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
