For example, a control that is an alarm clock might be invisible except when the alarm was sounding. This is easily accomplished by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property is `true`, your control will appear as normal. If `false`, your control will be hidden. Although code in your control may still run while invisible, you will not be able to interact with the control through the user interface. If you want to create an invisible control that still responds to user input (for example, mouse clicks), you should create a transparent control. For more information, see [Giving Your Control a Transparent Background](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md).  \n  \n### To make your control invisible at run time  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property to `false`.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' To set the Visible property from within your object's own code.  \n    Me.Visible = False  \n    ' To set the Visible property from another object.  \n    myControl1.Visible = False  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // To set the Visible property from within your object's own code.  \n    this.Visible = false;  \n    // To set the Visible property from another object.  \n    myControl1.Visible = false;  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A>\n- [Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework](developing-custom-windows-forms-controls.md)\n- [How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,427],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], making invisible at run time\"\n  - \"invisible controls\"\n  - \"user controls [Windows Forms], invisible\"\n  - \"custom controls [Windows Forms], invisible\"\n  - \"run time [Windows Forms], making controls invisible\"\nms.assetid: 69eb2e72-32f5-4f79-a157-c2c5f60c1628","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[434,481],"content":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","linkify":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Your Control Invisible at Run Time","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"There are times when you might want to create a user control that is invisible at run time.","pos":[482,573]},{"content":"For example, a control that is an alarm clock might be invisible except when the alarm was sounding.","pos":[574,674]},{"content":"This is easily accomplished by setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[675,774],"source":" This is easily accomplished by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property."},{"content":"If the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A&gt;</ph> property is <ph id=\"ph2\">`true`</ph>, your control will appear as normal.","pos":[775,884],"source":" If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property is `true`, your control will appear as normal."},{"content":"If <ph id=\"ph1\">`false`</ph>, your control will be hidden.","pos":[885,925],"source":" If `false`, your control will be hidden."},{"content":"Although code in your control may still run while invisible, you will not be able to interact with the control through the user interface.","pos":[926,1064]},{"content":"If you want to create an invisible control that still responds to user input (for example, mouse clicks), you should create a transparent control.","pos":[1065,1211]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Giving Your Control a Transparent Background<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)</ept>.","pos":[1212,1339],"source":" For more information, see [Giving Your Control a Transparent Background](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)."},{"pos":[1349,1391],"content":"To make your control invisible at run time","linkify":"To make your control invisible at run time","nodes":[{"content":"To make your control invisible at run time","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[1401,1476],"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph>.","source":"Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Visible%2A> property to `false`."},{"pos":[1919,1927],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1980,2091],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework<ept id=\"p1\">](developing-custom-windows-forms-controls.md)</ept>","source":"[Developing Custom Windows Forms Controls with the .NET Framework](developing-custom-windows-forms-controls.md)"},{"pos":[2094,2200],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background](how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)"}]}
