To move and keep track of controls and windows within the context of a group, you manipulate their z-order. *Z-order* is the visual layering of controls on a form along the form's z-axis (depth). The window at the top of the z-order overlaps all other windows. All other windows overlap the window at the bottom of the z-order.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To layer controls at design time  \n  \n1.  Select a control that you want to layer.  \n  \n2.  On the **Format** menu, point to **Order**, and then click **Bring To Front** or **Send To Back**.  \n  \n### To layer controls programmatically  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BringToFront%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.SendToBack%2A> methods to manipulate the z-order of the controls.  \n  \n     For example, if a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control, `txtFirstName`, is underneath another control and you want to have it on top, use the following code:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    txtFirstName.BringToFront()  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    txtFirstName.BringToFront();  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    txtFirstName->BringToFront();  \n    ```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Windows Forms supports *control containment*. Control containment involves placing a number of controls within a containing control, such as a number of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control. You can then layer the controls within the containing control. Moving the group box moves the controls as well, because they are contained inside it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/index.md)   \n [Arranging Controls on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/arranging-controls-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Labeling Individual Windows Forms Controls and Providing Shortcuts to Them](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/labeling-individual-windows-forms-controls-and-providing-shortcuts-to-them.md)   \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)   \n [Windows Forms Controls by Function](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-by-function.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"How to: Layer Objects on Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Layer Objects on Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[579,617],"content":"How to: Layer Objects on Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Layer Objects on Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Layer Objects on Windows Forms","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"When you create a complex user interface, or work with a multiple document interface (MDI) form, you will often want to layer both controls and child forms to create more complex user interfaces (UI).","pos":[618,818]},{"content":"To move and keep track of controls and windows within the context of a group, you manipulate their z-order.","pos":[819,926]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Z-order<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> is the visual layering of controls on a form along the form's z-axis (depth).","pos":[927,1014],"source":"*Z-order* is the visual layering of controls on a form along the form's z-axis (depth)."},{"content":"The window at the top of the z-order overlaps all other windows.","pos":[1015,1079]},{"content":"All other windows overlap the window at the bottom of the z-order.","pos":[1080,1146]},{"pos":[1154,1530],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
