Whenever the user presses the ENTER key, the default button is clicked regardless of which other control on the form has the focus.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The exceptions to this are when the control with focus is another button — in that case, the button with the focus will be clicked — or a multiline text box, or a custom control that traps the ENTER key.  \n  \n### To designate the accept button  \n  \n1.  Set the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub SetDefault(ByVal myDefaultBtn As Button)  \n      Me.AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn   \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void SetDefault(Button myDefaultBtn)  \n    {  \n       this.AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void SetDefault(Button ^ myDefaultBtn)  \n       {  \n          this->AcceptButton = myDefaultBtn;  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.AcceptButton%2A>   \n [Button Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [Ways to Select a Windows Forms Button Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/ways-to-select-a-windows-forms-button-control.md)   \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms Button Clicks](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-button-clicks.md)   \n [How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Cancel Button](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-designate-a-windows-forms-button-as-the-cancel-button.md)   \n [Button Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/button-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,633],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Designate a Windows Forms Button as the Accept Button | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
