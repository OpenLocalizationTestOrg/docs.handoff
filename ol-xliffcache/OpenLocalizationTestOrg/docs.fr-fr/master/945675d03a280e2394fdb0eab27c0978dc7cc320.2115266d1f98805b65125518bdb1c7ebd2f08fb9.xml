You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation.IsAdditive%2A> property with most basic animations and most key frame animations. For more information, see [Animation Overview](animation-overview.md) and [Key-Frame Animations Overview](key-frame-animations-overview.md).  \n  \n The following example shows the effect of using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation.IsAdditive%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property with <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimation> and using the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames.IsAdditive%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property with <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.DoubleAnimationUsingKeyFrames>.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[timingbehaviors_snip#IsAdditiveWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/timingbehaviors_snip/CSharp/IsAdditiveExample.xaml#isadditivewholepage)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Accumulate Animation Values During Repeat Cycles](how-to-accumulate-animation-values-during-repeat-cycles.md)\n- [Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)\n- [Key-Frame Animations Overview](key-frame-animations-overview.md)\n- [Animation and Timing How-to Topics](animation-and-timing-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,196],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Add an Animation Output Value to an Animation Starting Value\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
