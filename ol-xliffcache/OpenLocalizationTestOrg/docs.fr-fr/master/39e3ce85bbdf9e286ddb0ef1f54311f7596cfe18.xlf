          <source>You can then host your Docker containers in your own Linux or Windows infrastructure, or use a cloud service such as <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>Azure Container Service<ept id="p1">](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-service/)</ept> which can manage, orchestrate and scale your container-based application in the cloud.</source>
