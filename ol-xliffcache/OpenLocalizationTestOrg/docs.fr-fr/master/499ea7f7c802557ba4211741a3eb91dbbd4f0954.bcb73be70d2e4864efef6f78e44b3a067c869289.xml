For example, if you create a function that searches text for a particular string, you can select the text to visually alert the reader of the found string's position.  \n  \n### To select text programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionStart%2A> property to the beginning of the text you want to select.  \n  \n     The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionStart%2A> property is a number that indicates the insertion point within the string of text, with 0 being the left-most position. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionStart%2A> property is set to a value equal to or greater than the number of characters in the text box, the insertion point is placed after the last character.  \n  \n2.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionLength%2A> property to the length of the text you want to select.  \n  \n     The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionLength%2A> property is a numeric value that sets the width of the insertion point. Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectionLength%2A> to a number greater than 0 causes that number of characters to be selected, starting from the current insertion point.  \n  \n3.  (Optional) Access the selected text through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.SelectedText%2A> property.  \n  \n     The code below selects the contents of a text box when the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Enter> event occurs. This example checks if the text box has a value for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property that is not `null` or an empty string. When the text box receives the focus, the current text in the text box is selected. The `TextBox1_Enter` event handler must be bound to the control; for more information, see [How to: Create Event Handlers at Run Time for Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/how-to-create-event-handlers-at-run-time-for-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n     To test this example, press the Tab key until the text box has the focus. If you click in the text box, the text is unselected.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub TextBox1_Enter(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles TextBox1.Enter  \n       If (Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(TextBox1.Text)) Then  \n          TextBox1.SelectionStart = 0  \n          TextBox1.SelectionLength = TextBox1.Text.Length  \n       End If  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void textBox1_Enter(object sender, System.EventArgs e){  \n       if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(textBox1.Text))  \n       {  \n          textBox1.SelectionStart = 0;  \n          textBox1.SelectionLength = textBox1.Text.Length;  \n       }  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void textBox1_Enter(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::EventArgs ^ e) {  \n       if (!System::String::IsNullOrEmpty(textBox1->Text))  \n       {  \n          textBox1->SelectionStart = 0;  \n          textBox1->SelectionLength = textBox1->Text->Length;  \n       }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>   \n [TextBox Control
