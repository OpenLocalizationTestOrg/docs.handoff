The managed class is used with the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.HostProtectionResource?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration, whose values correspond directly to the `EApiCategories` values, to mark managed types and members that expose capabilities corresponding to the categories described by `EApiCategories`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
