If the defining declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the implementing declaration must also have it. Conversely, if the implementing declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the defining declaration must also.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Assuming that the defining declaration is correct, add or remove the `unsafe` modifier from the implementing declaration to match the defining declaration.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// cs0764.cs  \n//  Compile with: /target:library /unsafe  \npublic partial class C  \n{  \n    partial void Part();  \n    unsafe partial void Part() //CS0764  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    public static int Main()  \n    {  \n        return 1;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Partial Classes and Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0764 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0764 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS0764","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0764","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0764","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Both partial method declarations must be unsafe or neither may be unsafe","pos":[587,659]},{"content":"A partial method consists of a defining declaration (signature) and an optional implementing declaration (body).","pos":[666,778]},{"content":"If the defining declaration has the <ph id=\"ph1\">`unsafe`</ph> modifier, the implementing declaration must also have it.","pos":[779,881],"source":" If the defining declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the implementing declaration must also have it."},{"content":"Conversely, if the implementing declaration has the <ph id=\"ph1\">`unsafe`</ph> modifier, the defining declaration must also.","pos":[882,988],"source":" Conversely, if the implementing declaration has the `unsafe` modifier, the defining declaration must also."},{"pos":[997,1018],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1028,1183],"content":"Assuming that the defining declaration is correct, add or remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`unsafe`</ph> modifier from the implementing declaration to match the defining declaration.","source":"Assuming that the defining declaration is correct, add or remove the `unsafe` modifier from the implementing declaration to match the defining declaration."},{"pos":[1192,1199],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1470,1478],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1482,1594],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Partial Classes and Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Partial Classes and Methods](../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)"}]}
