The *machine.config* file is stored in the *%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework* folder in the directory where Windows was installed. There is a separate *machine.config* file in the folders under *%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework* for each version of the .NET Framework installed on the computer (for example, *C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\machine.config*).  \n  \n These settings can also be made in the configuration file for the application, which has precedence over the computer configuration file.  \n  \n For .NET Framework version 1.1 and earlier, the value of the **ipv6 enabled** configuration switch specifies whether members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class return IPv6 addresses.  \n  \n For .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, if Windows supports IPv6, then all members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class (for example, the <xref:System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method), will return IPv6 addresses with one limitation. Obsolete members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class (for example, the <xref:System.Net.Dns.Resolve%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method) will read and recognize the value in the configuration file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, IPv6 is enabled by default. For .NET Framework version 1.1 and earlier, IPv6 is disabled by default.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n<system.net>  \n    …………  \n    <settings>  \n        …………  \n        <ipv6 enabled=\"true\"/>   \n    ……………  \n    </settings>  \n    ………………  \n<system.net>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IPv6 Addressing](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/ipv6-addressing.md)   \n [Network Settings Schema](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/index.md)   \n [\\<ipv6> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/ipv6-element-network-settings.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,98],"content":"How to: Modify the Computer Configuration File to Enable IPv6 Support | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Modify the Computer Configuration File to Enable IPv6 Support | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,86]}]},{"pos":[422,491],"content":"How to: Modify the Computer Configuration File to Enable IPv6 Support","linkify":"How to: Modify the Computer Configuration File to Enable IPv6 Support","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Modify the Computer Configuration File to Enable IPv6 Support","pos":[0,69]}]},{"content":"The following code example shows how to modify the computer configuration file, <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>machine.config<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, to enable IPv6 support.","pos":[492,613],"source":"The following code example shows how to modify the computer configuration file, *machine.config*, to enable IPv6 support."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>machine.config<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> file is stored in the <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> folder in the directory where Windows was installed.","pos":[614,744],"source":" The *machine.config* file is stored in the *%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework* folder in the directory where Windows was installed."},{"content":"There is a separate <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>machine.config<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> file in the folders under <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> for each version of the .NET Framework installed on the computer (for example, <bpt id=\"p3\">*</bpt>C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\machine.config<ept id=\"p3\">*</ept>).","pos":[745,986],"source":" There is a separate *machine.config* file in the folders under *%Windir%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework* for each version of the .NET Framework installed on the computer (for example, *C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\machine.config*)."},{"content":"These settings can also be made in the configuration file for the application, which has precedence over the computer configuration file.","pos":[993,1130]},{"pos":[1137,1344],"content":"For .NET Framework version 1.1 and earlier, the value of the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ipv6 enabled<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> configuration switch specifies whether members of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class return IPv6 addresses.","source":"For .NET Framework version 1.1 and earlier, the value of the **ipv6 enabled** configuration switch specifies whether members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class return IPv6 addresses."},{"content":"For .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, if Windows supports IPv6, then all members of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class (for example, the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> method), will return IPv6 addresses with one limitation.","pos":[1351,1633],"source":"For .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, if Windows supports IPv6, then all members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class (for example, the <xref:System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntry%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method), will return IPv6 addresses with one limitation."},{"content":"Obsolete members of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class (for example, the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.Dns.Resolve%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> method) will read and recognize the value in the configuration file.","pos":[1634,1855],"source":" Obsolete members of the <xref:System.Net.Dns?displayProperty=fullName> class (for example, the <xref:System.Net.Dns.Resolve%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method) will read and recognize the value in the configuration file."},{"pos":[1863,2016],"content":"[!NOTE]\n For .NET Framework version 2.0 and later, IPv6 is enabled by default.
