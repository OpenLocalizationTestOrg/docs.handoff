Settings that are user-scoped, however, can be written at run time just as you would change any property value. The new value persists for the duration of the application session. You can persist the changes to the settings between application sessions by calling the Save method.  \n  \n## How To: Write and Persist User Settings at Run Time with C\\#\n  \n1.
