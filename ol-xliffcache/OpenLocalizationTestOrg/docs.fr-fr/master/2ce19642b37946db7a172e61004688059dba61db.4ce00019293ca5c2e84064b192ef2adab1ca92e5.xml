The `Bitmap` class and the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> class both inherit from the `Image` class. The `Bitmap` class expands on the capabilities of the `Image` class by providing additional methods for loading, saving, and manipulating raster images. The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> class expands on the capabilities of the `Image` class by providing additional methods for recording and examining vector images.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Types of Bitmaps](types-of-bitmaps.md)  \n Discusses the various image formats.  \n  \n [Metafiles in GDI+](metafiles-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] support for metafiles.  \n  \n [Drawing, Positioning, and Cloning Images in GDI+](drawing-positioning-and-cloning-images-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses methods for drawing vector and raster images with managed code.  \n  \n [Cropping and Scaling Images in GDI+](cropping-and-scaling-images-in-gdi.md)  \n Discusses methods for cropping and scaling vector and raster images with managed code  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Image>  \n Describes this class and has links to all of its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>  \n Describes this class and has links to all of its members  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)  \n Contains links to topics that demonstrate how to use images in your application.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,301],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
