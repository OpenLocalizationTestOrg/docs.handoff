The supported views are determined by the control developer and are specific to each control.  \n  \n<a name=\"Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions\"></a>   \n## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  \n When implementing the Multiple View control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider> should also be implemented on a container that manages the current view if it is different from a control that provides the current view. For example, Windows Explorer contains a List control for the current folder content while the view for the control is managed from the Windows Explorer application.  \n  \n-   A control that is able to sort its content is not considered to support multiple views.  \n  \n-   The collection of views must be identical across instances.  \n  \n-   View names must be suitable for use in Text to Speech, Braille, and other human-readable applications.  \n  \n<a name=\"Required_Members_for_IMultipleViewProvider\"></a>   \n## Required Members for IMultipleViewProvider  \n The following properties and methods are required for implementing IMultipleViewProvider.  \n  \n|Required members|Member type|Notes|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.CurrentView%2A>|Property|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetSupportedViews%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A>|Method|None|  \n  \n There are no events associated with this control pattern.  \n  \n<a name=\"Exceptions\"></a>   \n## Exceptions  \n Provider must throw the following exceptions.  \n  \n|Exception type|Condition|  \n|--------------------|---------------|  \n|<xref:System.ArgumentException>|When either <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A> is called with a parameter that is not a member of the supported views collection.|  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [UI Automation Control Patterns Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-overview.md)\n- [Support Control Patterns in a UI Automation Provider](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/support-control-patterns-in-a-ui-automation-provider.md)\n- [UI Automation Control Patterns for Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-for-clients.md)\n- [UI Automation Tree Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-tree-overview.md)\n- [Use Caching in UI Automation](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-caching-in-ui-automation.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,287],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"UI Automation, MultipleView control pattern\"\n  - \"MultipleView control pattern\"\n  - \"control patterns, MultipleView\"\nms.assetid: 5bf1b248-ffee-48c8-9613-0b134bbe9f6a","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[294,353],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","linkify":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[356,819],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
