With [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] you can create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images as objects. [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is designed to offer performance and ease of use. You can use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] to render graphical images on Windows Forms and controls. Although you cannot use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] directly on Web Forms, you can display graphical images through the Image Web Server control.  \n  \n In this section, you will find topics that introduce the fundamentals of [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] programming. Although not intended to be a comprehensive reference, this section includes information about the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, <xref:System.Drawing.Pen>, <xref:System.Drawing.Brush>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Color> objects, and explains how to perform such tasks as drawing shapes, drawing text, or displaying images. For more information, see \"GDI+ Reference\" in the MSDN library at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library.  \n  \n If you'd like to jump in and get started right away, see [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md). It has topics on how to use code to draw lines, shapes, text, and more on Windows forms.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides an introduction to the graphics-related managed classes.  \n  \n [About GDI+ Managed Code](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/about-gdi-managed-code.md)  \n Provides information about the managed [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes.  \n  \n [Using Managed Graphics Classes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-managed-graphics-classes.md)  \n Demonstrates how to complete a variety of tasks using the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] managed classes.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing>  \n Provides access to [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] basic graphics functionality.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D>  \n Provides advanced two-dimensional and vector graphics functionality.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging>  \n Provides advanced [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] imaging functionality.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Text>  \n Provides advanced [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] typography functionality.
