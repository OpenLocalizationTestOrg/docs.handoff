This is the default behavior.  \n  \n-   To export metadata for a compiled service using Svcutil.exe, specify the service assembly or assemblies as input parameters. You must use the `/serviceName` option to indicate the configuration name of the service you want to export. Svcutil.exe automatically loads the configuration file for the specified executable assembly.  \n  \n-   To export all data contract types within a set of assemblies, use the `/dataContractOnly` option.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Use the `/reference` option to specify the file paths to any dependent assemblies.  \n  \n### To export metadata for compiled service contracts  \n  \n1.  Compile your service contract implementations into one or more class libraries.1  \n  \n2.  Run Svcutil.exe on the compiled assemblies.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You might need to use the `/reference` switch to specify the file path to any dependent assemblies.  \n  \n    ```  \n    svcutil.exe Contracts.dll  \n    ```  \n  \n### To export metadata for a compiled service  \n  \n1.  Compile your service implementation into an executable assembly.  \n  \n2.  Create a configuration file for your service executable and add a service configuration.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n    <configuration>  \n      <system.serviceModel>  \n        <services>  \n          <service name=\"MyService\" >  \n            <endpoint address=\"finder\" contract=\"IPeopleFinder\" binding=\"wsHttpBinding\" />  \n          </service>  \n        </services>  \n      </system.serviceModel>  \n    </configuration>  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Run Svcutil.exe on the compiled service executable using the `/serviceName` switch to specify the configuration name of the service.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You might need to use the `/reference` switch to specify the file path to any dependent assemblies.  \n  \n    ```  \n    svcutil.exe /serviceName:MyService Service.exe /reference:path/Contracts.dll  \n    ```  \n  \n### To export metadata for compiled data contracts  \n  \n1.  Compile your data contract implementations into one or more class libraries.  \n  \n2.  Run Svcutil.exe on the compiled assemblies using the `/dataContract` switch to specify that only metadata for data contracts should be generated.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You might need to use the `/reference` switch to specify the file path to any dependent assemblies.  \n  \n    ```  \n    svcutil.exe /dataContractOnly Contracts.dll  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to generate metadata for a simple service implementation and configuration.  \n  \n To export metadata for the service contract.  \n  \n```  \nsvcutil.exe Contracts.dll  \n```  \n  \n To export metadata for the data contracts.  \n  \n```  \nsvcutil.exe /dataContractOnly Contracts.dll  \n```  \n  \n To export metadata for the service implementation.  \n  \n```  \nsvcutil.exe /serviceName:MyService Service.exe /reference:<path>/Contracts.dll  \n```  \n  \n The `<path>` is the path to Contracts.dll.  \n  \n```  \n// The following service contract and data contracts are compiled into   \n// Contracts.dll.  \n[ServiceContract(ConfigurationName=\"IPeopleFinder\")]  \npublic interface IPersonFinder  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    Address GetAddress(Person s);  \n}  \n  \n[DataContract]  \npublic class Person  \n{  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public string firstName;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public string lastName;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public int age;  \n}  \n  \n[DataContract]  \npublic class Address  \n{  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public string city;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public string state;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public string street;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public int zipCode;  \n    [DataMember]  \n    public Person person;  \n}  \n  \n// The following service implementation is compiled into Service.exe.     \n// This service uses the contracts specified in Contracts.dll.  \n[ServiceBehavior(ConfigurationName = \"MyService\")]  \npublic class MyService : IPersonFinder  \n{  \n    public Address GetAddress(Person person)  \n    {  \n        Address address = new Address();  \n        address.person = person;  \n        return address;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n<!-- The following is the configuration file for Service.exe. -->  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n<configuration>  \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <services>  \n      <service name=\"MyService\">  \n         <endpoint  address=\"finder\"  \n                    binding=\"basicHttpBinding\"  \n                    contract=\"IPeopleFinder\"/>  \n      </service>  \n    </services>  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n
