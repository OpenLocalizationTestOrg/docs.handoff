You can improve the load time by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached property to `true`.  The UI might also be slow to react when a user scrolls the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> by using the mouse wheel or dragging the thumb of a scrollbar. You can improve the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> when the user scrolls by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode>.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n## Description  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView> that sets <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel.IsVirtualizing%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to true and <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode> to optimize its performance.  \n  \n## Code  \n [!code-xml[RecycleItemContainerShippets#VirtualizingTreeView](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml#virtualizingtreeview)]  \n  \n The following example shows the data that the previous example uses.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RecycleItemContainerShippets#TreeViewData](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#treeviewdata)]\n [!code-vb[RecycleItemContainerShippets#TreeViewData](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#treeviewdata)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Controls](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/optimizing-performance-controls.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,452],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Improve the Performance of a TreeView | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
