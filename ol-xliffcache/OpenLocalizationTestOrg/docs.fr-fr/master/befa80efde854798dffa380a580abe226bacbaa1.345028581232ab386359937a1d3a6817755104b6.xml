Events implicitly create several variables. For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`.\n\n**Error ID:** BC31059\n\n## To correct this error\n\n- Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.\n\n## See also\n\n- [Declaration Statements](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md#declaration-statements)\n- [Events](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,280],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<eventname>' implicitly defines '<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in <type> '<typename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords:\n  - \"bc31059\"\n  - \"vbc31059\"\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"BC31059\"\nms.assetid: 60ddb2f4-a204-41eb-b13b-b2bb13ddb69c","nodes":[{"content":"'<eventname>' implicitly defines '<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in <type> '<typename>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,121],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;eventname&gt;</ph>' implicitly defines '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;membername&gt;</ph>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;type&gt;</ph> '<ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;typename&gt;</ph>'","source":"'<eventname>' implicitly defines '<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in <type> '<typename>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[288,413],"content":"'\\<eventname>' implicitly defines '\\<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in \\<type> '\\<typename>'","linkify":"'\\<eventname>' implicitly defines '\\<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in \\<type> '\\<typename>'","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>eventname&gt;' implicitly defines '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>membername&gt;', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in <ph id=\"ph3\">\\&lt;</ph>type&gt; '<ph id=\"ph4\">\\&lt;</ph>typename&gt;'","pos":[0,125],"source":"'\\<eventname>' implicitly defines '\\<membername>', which conflicts with a member implicitly declared in \\<type> '\\<typename>'"}]},{"content":"The name of a type member conflicts with the name of a member implicitly created for an event.","pos":[415,509]},{"content":"Events implicitly create several variables.","pos":[510,553]},{"content":"For example, the declaration <ph id=\"ph1\">`Event X`</ph> implicitly declares the names <ph id=\"ph2\">`XEventHandler`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">`XEvent`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph4\">`add_X`</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph5\">`remove_X`</ph>.","pos":[554,674],"source":" For example, the declaration `Event X` implicitly declares the names `XEventHandler`, `XEvent`, `add_X`, and `remove_X`."},{"pos":[676,697],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31059","source":"**Error ID:** BC31059"},{"pos":[702,723],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Rename the explicitly declared member to remove the naming conflict.","pos":[727,795]},{"pos":[800,808],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[812,930],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Declaration Statements<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md#declaration-statements)</ept>","source":"[Declaration Statements](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md#declaration-statements)"},{"pos":[933,1013],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Events](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/index.md)"}]}
