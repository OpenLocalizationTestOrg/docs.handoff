The control displays a grid containing the numbered days of the month, arranged in columns underneath the days of the week. You can select a different month by clicking the arrow buttons on either side of the month caption. Unlike the similar <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control, you can select a range of dates with this control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control allows you to set times as well as dates.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [MonthCalendar Control Overview](monthcalendar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `MonthCalendar` control, which allows users to view and set date information for an application.  \n  \n [How to: Change the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control's Appearance](how-to-change-monthcalendar-control-appearance.md)  \n Describes how to customize the appearance of the `MonthCalendar` control.  \n  \n [How to: Display More than One Month in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](display-more-than-one-month-wf-monthcalendar-control.md)  \n Describes how to configure the `MonthCalendar` control to display several months simultaneously.  \n  \n [How to: Display Specific Days in Bold with the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](display-specific-days-in-bold-with-wf-monthcalendar-control.md)  \n Explains how to set certain dates to appear bold.  \n  \n [How to: Select a Range of Dates in the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control](how-to-select-a-range-of-dates-in-the-windows-forms-monthcalendar-control.md)  \n Explains how to programmatically select a range of dates from the `MonthCalendar` control.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [DateTimePicker Control](datetimepicker-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes a control similar to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar>, although the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control also allows you to select a time and does not allow you to select a range of dates.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,265],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"calendar controls\"\n  - \"MonthCalendar control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"dates [Windows Forms], controls\"\n  - \"calendars\"\nms.assetid: 051c6518-e0ca-426b-855c-f9bf70972970","nodes":[{"content":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[272,309],"content":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"MonthCalendar Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`MonthCalendar`</ph> control presents an intuitive graphical interface for users to view and set date information.","pos":[310,437],"source":"The Windows Forms `MonthCalendar` control presents an intuitive graphical interface for users to view and set date information."},{"content":"The control displays a grid containing the numbered days of the month, arranged in columns underneath the days of the week.","pos":[438,561]},{"content":"You can select a different month by clicking the arrow buttons on either side of the month caption.","pos":[562,661]},{"content":"Unlike the similar <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker&gt;</ph> control, you can select a range of dates with this control;
