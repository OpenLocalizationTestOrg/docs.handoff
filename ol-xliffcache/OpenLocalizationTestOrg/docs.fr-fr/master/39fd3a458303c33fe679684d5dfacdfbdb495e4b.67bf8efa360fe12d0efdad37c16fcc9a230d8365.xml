For example, the following `switch` statement determines whether a variable of type `Color` has one of three values: \n\n[!code-cs[switch#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch3.cs#1)] \n\nIt is equivalent to the following example that uses an `if`-`else` construct. \n\n[!code-cs[switch#3a](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch3a.cs#1)] \n\n## The match expression\n\nThe match expression provides the value to match against the patterns in `case` labels. Its syntax is:\n\n```csharp\n   switch (expr)\n```\n\nIn C# 6, the match expression must be an expression that returns a value of the following types:\n\n- a [char](char.md).\n- a [string](string.md).\n- a [bool](bool.md). \n- an integral value, such as an [int](int.md) or a [long](long.md).\n- an [enum](enum.md) value.\n\nStarting with C# 7, the match expression can be any non-null expression.\n \n## The switch section\n \n A `switch` statement includes one or more switch sections. Each switch section contains one or more *case labels* followed by one or more statements. The following example shows a simple `switch` statement that has three switch sections. Each switch section has one case label, such as `case 1:`, and two statements.\n \n  A `switch` statement can include any number of switch sections, and each section can have one or more case labels, as shown in the following example. However, no two case labels may contain the same expression.  \n\n [!code-cs[switch#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch2.cs#1)]  \n\n Only one switch section in a switch statement executes. C# does not allow execution to continue from one switch section to the next. Because of this, the following code generates a compiler error, CS0163: \"Control cannot fall through from one case label (<case label>) to another.\"   \n\n```csharp  \nswitch (caseSwitch)  \n{  \n    // The following switch section causes an error.  \n    case 1:  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Case 1...\");  \n        // Add a break or other jump statement here.  \n    case 2:  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"... and/or Case 2\");  \n        break;  \n}  \n```  \nThis requirement is usually met by explicitly exiting the switch section by using a [break](break.md), [goto](goto.md), or [return](return.md) statement. However, the following code is also valid, because it ensures that program control cannot fall through to the `default` switch section.\n  \n [!code-cs[switch#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch4.cs#1)]    \n  \n Execution of the statement list in the switch section with a case label that matches the match expression begins with the first statement and proceeds through the statement list, typically until a jump statement, such as a `break`, `goto case`, `return`, or `throw`, is reached. At that point, control is transferred outside the `switch` statement or to another case label.  \n\n## Case labels\n\n Each case label specifies a pattern to compare to the match expression (the `caseSwitch` variable in the previous examples). If they match, control is transferred to the switch section that contains the **first** matching case label. If no case label pattern matches the match expression, control is transfered to the section with the `default` case label, if there is one. If there is no `default` case, no statements in any switch section are executed, and control is transferred outside the `switch` statement.\n\n For information on the `switch` statement and pattern matching, see the [Pattern matching with the `switch` statement](#pattern) section.\n\n Because C# 6 supports only the constant pattern and does not allow the repetition of constant values, case labels define mutually exclusive values, and only one pattern can match the match expression. As a result, the order in which `case` statements appear is unimportant.\n\n In C# 7, however, because other patterns are supported, case labels need not define mutually exclusive values, and multiple patterns can match the match expression. Because only the statements in the switch section that contains the first matching pattern are executed, the order in which `case` statements appear is now important. If C# detects a switch section whose case statement or statements are equivalent to or are subsets of previous statements, it generates a compiler error, CS8120, \"The switch case has already been handled by a previous case.\" \n\n The following example illustrates a `switch` statement that uses a variety of non-mutually exclusive patterns. If you move the `case 0:` switch section so that it is no longer the first section in the `switch` statement, C# generates a compiler error because an integer whose value is zero is a subset of all integers, which is the pattern defined by the `case int val` statement.\n\n [!code-cs[switch#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch5.cs#1)]    \n\nYou can correct this issue and eliminate the compiler warning in one of two ways:\n\n- By changing the order of the switch sections. \n \n- By using a </a name=\"when\">when clause</a> in the `case` label.\n \n## The `default` case\n\nThe `default` case specifies the switch section to execute if the match expression does not match any other `case` label. If a `default` case is not present and the match expression does not match any other `case` label, program flow falls through the `switch` statement.\n\nThe `default` case can appear in any order in the `switch` statement. Regardless of its order in the source code, it is always evaluated last, after all `case` labels have been evaluated.\n\n## <a name=\"pattern\" /> Pattern matching with the `switch` statement\n  \nEach `case` statement defines a pattern that, if it matches the match expression, causes its  containing switch section to be executed. All versions of C# support the constant pattern. The remaining patterns are supported beginning with C# 7. \n  \n### Constant pattern \n\nThe constant pattern tests whether the match expression equals a specified constant. Its syntax is:\n\n```csharp\n   case constant:\n```\n\nwhere *constant* is the value to test for. *constant* can be any of the following constant expressions: \n\n- A [bool](bool.md) literal, either `true` or `false`.\n- Any integral constant, such as an [int](int.md), a [long](long.md), or a [byte](byte.md). \n- The name of a declared `const` variable.\n- An enumeration constant.\n- A [char](char.md) literal.\n- A [string](string.md) literal.\n\nThe constant expression is evaluated as follows:\n\n- If *expr* and *constant* are integral types, the C# equality operator determines whether the expression returns `true` (that is, whether `expr == constant`).\n\n- Otherwise, the value of the expression is determined by a call to the static [Object.Equals(expr, constant)](xref:System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)) method.  \n\nThe following example uses the constant pattern to determine whether a particular date is a weekend, the first day of the work week, the last day of the work week, or the middle of the work week. It evalutes the [DateTime.DayOfWeek](xref:System.DateTime.DayOfWeek) property of the current day against the members of the @System.DayOfWeek enumeration. \n\n[!code-cs[switch#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/const-pattern.cs#1)]\n\nThe following example uses the constant pattern to handle user input in a console application that simulates an automatic coffee machine.\n  \n [!code-cs[switch#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/switch6.cs)]  \n\n### Type pattern\n\nThe type pattern enables concise type evaluation and conversion. When used with the `switch` statement to perform pattern matching, it tests whether an expression can be converted to a specified type and, if it can be, casts it to a variable of that type. Its syntax is:\n\n```csharp\n   case type varname \n```\nwhere *type* is the name of the type to which the result of *expr* is to be converted, and *varname* is the object to which the result of *expr* is converted if the match succeeds. \n\nThe `case` expression is `true` if any of the following is true:\n\n- *expr* is an instance of the same type as *type*.\n\n- *expr* is an instance of a type that derives from *type*. In other words, the result of *expr* can be upcast to an instance of *type*.\n\n- *expr* has a compile-time type that is a base class of *type*, and *expr* has a runtime type that is *type* or is derived from *type*. The *compile-time type* of a variable is the variable's type as defined in its type declaration. The *runtime type* of a variable is the type of the instance that is assigned to that variable.\n\n- *expr* is an instance of a type that implements the *type* interface.\n\nIf the case expression is true, *varname* is definitely assigned and has local scope within the switch section only.\n\nNote that `null` does not match a type. To match a `null`, you use the following `case` label:\n\n```csharp\ncase null:\n```\n \nThe following example uses the type pattern to provide information about various kinds of collection types.\n\n[!code-cs[switch#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/type-pattern.cs#1)]\n\nWithout pattern matching, this code might be written as follows. The use of type pattern matching produces more compact, readable code by eliminating the need to test whether the result of a conversion is a `null` or to perform repeated casts.  \n\n[!code-cs[switch#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/type-pattern2.cs#1)]\n\n## The `case` statement and the `when` clause\n\nStarting with C# 7, because case statements need not be mutually exclusive, you can use add a `when` clause to specify an additional condition that must be satisfied for the case statement to evaluate to true. The `when` clause can be any expression that returns a Boolean value. One of the more common uses for the `when` clause is used to prevent a switch section from executing when the value of a match expression is `null`. \n\n The following example defines a base `Shape` class, a `Rectangle` class that derives from `Shape`, and a `Square` class that derives from `Rectangle`. It uses the `when` clause to ensure that the `ShowShapeInfo` treats a `Rectangle` object that has been assigned equal lengths and widths as a `Square` even if is has not been instantiated as a `Square` object. The method does not attempt to display information either about an object that is `null` or a shape whose area is zero. \n\n[!code-cs[switch#8](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/language-reference/keywords/switch/when-clause.cs#1)]\n  \nNote that the `when` clause in the example that attempts to test whether a `Shape` object is `null` does not execute. The correct type pattern to test for a `null` is `case null:`.\n\n## C# Language Specification  \n [!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/includes/csharplangspec_md.md)]
