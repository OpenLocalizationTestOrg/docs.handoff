It applies a Boolean condition (*predicate*) to each source element (referenced by the range variable) and returns those for which the specified condition is true. A single query expression may contain multiple `where` clauses and a single clause may contain multiple predicate subexpressions.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the `where` clause filters out all numbers except those that are less than five. If you remove the `where` clause, all numbers from the data source would be returned. The expression `num < 5` is the predicate that is applied to each element.  \n  \n [!code-cs[cscsrefQueryKeywords#5](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/where-clause_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n Within a single `where` clause, you can specify as many predicates as necessary by using the [&&](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-and-operator.md) and [&#124;&#124;](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/conditional-or-operator.md) operators. In the following example, the query specifies two predicates in order to select only the even numbers that are less than five.  \n  \n [!code-cs[cscsrefQueryKeywords#6](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/where-clause_2.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n A `where` clause may contain one or more methods that return Boolean values. In the following example, the `where` clause uses a method to determine whether the current value of the range variable is even or odd.  \n  \n [!code-cs[cscsrefQueryKeywords#7](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/where-clause_3.cs)]  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `where` clause is a filtering mechanism. It can be positioned almost anywhere in a query expression, except it cannot be the first or last clause. A `where` clause may appear either before or after a [group](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/group-clause.md) clause depending on whether you have to filter the source elements before or after they are grouped.  \n  \n If a specified predicate is not valid for the elements in the data source, a compile-time error will result. This is one benefit of the strong type-checking provided by [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)].  \n  \n At compile time the `where` keyword is converted into a call to the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> Standard Query Operator method.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Query Keywords (LINQ)](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/query-keywords.md)   \n [from
