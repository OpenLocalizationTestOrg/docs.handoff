For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md).  \n  \n When you call the same function outside a query, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates a simple query from the method call expression. The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter `@p0` is bound to the constant passed in):  \n  \n```  \nSELECT dbo.ReverseCustName(@p0)  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates the following:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/Program.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#4](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/Module1.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method `ReverseCustName`. The function is not executed immediately because query execution is deferred. The SQL built for this query translates to a call to the user-defined function in the database (see the SQL code following the query).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqUDFS#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/cs/Program.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqUDFS#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqUDFS/vb/Module1.vb#5)]  \n  \n```  \nSELECT [t0].[ContactName],  \n    dbo.ReverseCustName([t0].[ContactTitle]) AS [Title]  \nFROM [Customers] AS [t0]  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,160],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: f80d4327-b6a5-4aa8-a743-e95d09a2a02e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","pos":[0,42]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[167,209],"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","linkify":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Call User-Defined Functions Inline","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"Although you can call user-defined functions inline, functions that are included in a query whose execution is deferred are not executed until the query is executed.","pos":[210,375]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)</ept>.","pos":[376,517],"source":" For more information, see [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](~/docs/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)."},{"content":"When you call the same function outside a query, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> creates a simple query from the method call expression.","pos":[524,696],"source":"When you call the same function outside a query, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates a simple query from the method call expression."},{"content":"The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter <ph id=\"ph1\">`@p0`</ph> is bound to the constant passed in):","pos":[697,786],"source":" The following is the SQL syntax (the parameter `@p0` is bound to the constant passed in):"},{"pos":[842,932],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> creates the following:","source":"[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] creates the following:"},{"pos":[1177,1184],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)]</ph> query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method <ph id=\"ph2\">`ReverseCustName`</ph>.","pos":[1188,1371],"source":"In the following [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] query, you can see an inline call to the generated user-defined function method `ReverseCustName`."},{"content":"The function is not executed immediately because query execution is deferred.","pos":[1372,1449]},{"content":"The SQL built for this query translates to a call to the user-defined function in the database (see the SQL code following the query).","pos":[1450,1584]},{"pos":[1958,1966],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1970,2075],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>User-Defined Functions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)</ept>","source":"[User-Defined Functions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/user-defined-functions.md)"}]}
