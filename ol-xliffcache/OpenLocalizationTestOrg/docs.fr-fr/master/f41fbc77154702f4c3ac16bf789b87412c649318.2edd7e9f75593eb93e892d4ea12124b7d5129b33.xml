You can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property before the control is displayed (for example, at design time or in the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event) to determine which date will be initially selected in the control. By default, the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> is set to the current date. If you change the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> in code, the control is automatically updated on the form to reflect the new setting.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property returns a <xref:System.DateTime> structure as its value. There are several properties of the <xref:System.DateTime> structure that return specific information about the displayed date. These properties can only be used to return a value; do not use them to set a value.  \n  \n-   For date values, the <xref:System.DateTime.Month%2A>, <xref:System.DateTime.Day%2A>, and <xref:System.DateTime.Year%2A> properties return integer values for those time units of the selected date. The <xref:System.DateTime.DayOfWeek%2A> property returns a value indicating the selected day of the week (possible values are listed in the <xref:System.DayOfWeek> enumeration).  \n  \n-   For time values, the <xref:System.DateTime.Hour%2A>, <xref:System.DateTime.Minute%2A>, <xref:System.DateTime.Second%2A>, and <xref:System.DateTime.Millisecond%2A> properties return integer values for those time units. To configure the control to display times, see [How to: Display Time with the DateTimePicker Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-time-with-the-datetimepicker-control.md).  \n  \n### To set the date and time value of the control  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property to a date or time value.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    DateTimePicker1.Value = New DateTime(2001, 10, 20)  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    dateTimePicker1.Value = new DateTime(2001, 10, 20);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    dateTimePicker1->Value = DateTime(2001, 10, 20);  \n    ```  \n  \n### To return the date and time value  \n  \n-   Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Text%2A> property to return the entire value as formatted in the control, or call the appropriate method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property to return a part of the value. Use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.ToString%2A> to convert the information into a string that can be displayed to the user.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"The selected value is \", DateTimePicker1.Text)  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"The day of the week is \",   \n       DateTimePicker1.Value.DayOfWeek.ToString)  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"Millisecond is: \",   \n       DateTimePicker1.Value.Millisecond.ToString)  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    MessageBox.Show (\"The selected value is \" +   \n       dateTimePicker1.Text);  \n    MessageBox.Show (\"The day of the week is \" +   \n       dateTimePicker1.Value.DayOfWeek.ToString());  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"Millisecond is: \" +   \n       dateTimePicker1.Value.Millisecond.ToString());  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    MessageBox::Show (String::Concat(\"The selected value is \",  \n       dateTimePicker1->Text));  \n    MessageBox::Show (String::Concat(\"The day of the week is \",  \n       dateTimePicker1->Value.DayOfWeek.ToString()));  \n    MessageBox::Show(String::Concat(\"Millisecond is: \",  \n       dateTimePicker1->Value.Millisecond.ToString()));  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [DateTimePicker Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/datetimepicker-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Display a Date in a Custom Format with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/display-a-date-in-a-custom-format-with-wf-datetimepicker-control.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,103],"content":"How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,91]}]},{"pos":[631,705],"content":"How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control","linkify":"How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set and Return Dates with the Windows Forms DateTimePicker Control","pos":[0,74]}]},{"content":"The currently selected date or time in the Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker&gt;</ph> control is determined by the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[706,896],"source":"The currently selected date or time in the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control is determined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property."},{"content":"You can set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A&gt;</ph> property before the control is displayed (for example, at design time or in the form's <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load&gt;</ph> event) to determine which date will be initially selected in the control.","pos":[897,1163],"source":" You can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property before the control is displayed (for example, at design time or in the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event) to determine which date will be initially selected in the control."},{"content":"By default, the control's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A&gt;</ph> is set to the current date.","pos":[1164,1269],"source":" By default, the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> is set to the current date."},{"content":"If you change the control's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A&gt;</ph> in code, the control is automatically updated on the form to reflect the new setting.","pos":[1270,1435],"source":" If you change the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> in code, the control is automatically updated on the form to reflect the new setting."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A&gt;</ph> property returns a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.DateTime&gt;</ph> structure as its value.","pos":[1442,1563],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker.Value%2A> property returns a <xref:System.DateTime> structure as its value."},{"content":"There are several properties of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.DateTime&gt;</ph> structure that return specific information about the displayed date.","pos":[1564,1691],"source":" There are several properties of the <xref:System.DateTime> structure that return specific information about the displayed date."},{"content":"These properties can only be used to return a value;
