The following procedures show how to perform these operations.  \n  \n### To generate classes that conform to a specific schema  \n  \n1.  Open a command prompt.  \n  \n2.  Pass the XML Schema as an argument to the XML Schema Definition tool, which creates a set of classes that are precisely matched to the XML Schema, for example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    xsd mySchema.xsd  \n    ```  \n  \n     The tool can only process schemas that reference the World Wide Web Consortium XML specification of March 16, 2001. In other words, the XML Schema namespace must be \"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>  \n    <xs:schema attributeFormDefault=\"qualified\" elementFormDefault=\"qualified\" targetNamespace=\"\" xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\">  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Modify the classes with methods, properties, or fields, as necessary. For more information about modifying a class with attributes, see [Controlling XML Serialization Using Attributes](../../../docs/framework/serialization/controlling-xml-serialization-using-attributes.md) and [Attributes That Control Encoded SOAP Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/attributes-that-control-encoded-soap-serialization.md).  \n  \n It is often useful to examine the schema of the XML stream that is generated when instances of a class (or classes) are serialized. For example, you might publish your schema for others to use, or you might compare it to a schema with which you are trying to achieve conformity.  \n  \n#### To generate an XML Schema document from a set of classes  \n  \n1.  Compile the class or classes into a DLL.  \n  \n2.  Open a command prompt.  \n  \n3.  Pass the DLL as an argument to Xsd.exe, for example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    xsd MyFile.dll  \n    ```  \n  \n     The schema (or schemas) will be written, beginning with the name \"schema0.xsd\".  \n
