To complete this topic you must first complete [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md) and [How to: Create a Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To download a completed version of the tutorial, see [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF45) - Getting Started Tutorial](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248976).  \n  \n### To create the workflow host project  \n  \n1.  Open the solution from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic by using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Right-click the **WF45GettingStartedTutorial** solution in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Project**.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If the **Solution Explorer** window is not displayed, select **Solution Explorer** from the **View** menu.  \n  \n3.  In the **Installed** node, select **Visual C#**, **Workflow** (or **Visual Basic**, **Workflow**).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Depending on which programming language is configured as the primary language in Visual Studio, the **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** node may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed** node.  \n  \n     Ensure that **.NET Framework 4.5** is selected in the .NET Framework version drop-down list. Select **Workflow Console Application** from the **Workflow** list. Type `NumberGuessWorkflowHost` into the **Name** box and click **OK**. This creates a starter workflow application with basic workflow hosting support. This basic hosting code is modified and used to run the workflow application.  \n  \n4.  Right-click the newly added **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add Reference**. Select **Solution** from the **Add Reference** list, check the checkbox beside **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities**, and then click **OK**.  \n  \n5.  Right-click **Workflow1.xaml** in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Delete**. Click **OK** to confirm.  \n  \n### To modify the workflow hosting code  \n  \n1.  Double-click **Program.cs** or **Module1.vb** in **Solution Explorer** to display the code.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If the **Solution Explorer** window is not displayed, select **Solution Explorer** from the **View** menu.  \n  \n     Because this project was created by using the **Workflow Console Application** template, **Program.cs** or **Module1.vb** contains the following basic workflow hosting code.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' Create and cache the workflow definition  \n    Activity workflow1 = new Workflow1()  \n    WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(workflow1)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Create and cache the workflow definition  \n    Activity workflow1 = new Workflow1();  \n    WorkflowInvoker.Invoke(workflow1);  \n    ```  \n  \n     This generated hosting code uses <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker>. <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> provides a simple way for invoking a workflow as if it were a method call and can be used only for workflows that do not use persistence. <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> provides a richer model for executing workflows that includes notification of life-cycle events, execution control, bookmark resumption, and persistence. This example uses bookmarks and <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> is used for hosting the workflow. Add the following `using` or **Imports** statement at the top of **Program.cs** or **Module1.vb** below the existing **using** or **Imports** statements.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Imports NumberGuessWorkflowActivities  \n    Imports System.Threading  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    using NumberGuessWorkflowActivities;  \n    using System.Threading;  \n    ```  \n  \n     Replace the lines of code that use <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowInvoker> with the following basic <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> hosting code. This sample hosting code demonstrates the basic steps for hosting and invoking a workflow, but does not yet contain the functionality to successfully run the workflow from this topic. In the following steps, this basic code is modified and additional features are added until the application is complete.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Please replace `Workflow1` in these examples with `FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow`, `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow`, or `StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow`, depending on which workflow you completed in the previous [How to: Create a Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow.md) step. If you do not replace `Workflow1` then you will get build errors when you try and build or run the workflow.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/extrasnippets.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/extrasnippets.vb#4)]  \n  \n     This code creates a <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication>, subscribes to three workflow life-cycle events, starts the workflow with a call to <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Run%2A>, and then waits for the workflow to complete. When the workflow completes, the <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> is set and the host application completes.  \n  \n### To set input arguments of a workflow  \n  \n1.  Add the following statement at the top of **Program.cs** or **Module1.vb** below the existing `using` or `Imports` statements.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#5)]  \n  \n2.  Replace the line of code that creates the new <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> with the following code that creates and passes a dictionary of parameters to the workflow when it is created.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Please replace `Workflow1` in these examples with `FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow`, `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow`, or `StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow`, depending on which workflow you completed in the previous [How to: Create a Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow.md) step. If you do not replace `Workflow1` then you will get build errors when you try and build or run the workflow.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#6)]  \n  \n     This dictionary contains one element with a key of `MaxNumber`. Keys in the input dictionary correspond to input arguments on the root activity of the workflow. `MaxNumber` is used by the workflow to determine the upper bound for the randomly generated number.  \n  \n### To retrieve output arguments of a workflow  \n  \n1.  Modify the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Completed%2A> handler to retrieve and display the number of turns used by the workflow.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#7)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#7)]  \n  \n### To resume a bookmark  \n  \n1.  Add the following code at the top of the `Main` method just after the existing <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#8)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#8)]  \n  \n2.  Add the following <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Idle%2A> handler just below the existing three workflow life-cycle handlers in `Main`.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#9)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#9)]  \n  \n     Each time the workflow becomes idle waiting for the next guess, this handler is called and the `idleAction` <xref:System.Threading.AutoResetEvent> is set. The code in the following step uses `idleEvent` and `syncEvent` to determine whether the workflow is waiting for the next guess or is complete.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  In this example, the host application uses auto-reset events in the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Completed%2A> and <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Idle%2A> handlers to synchronize the host application with the progress of the workflow. It is not necessary to block and wait for the workflow to become idle before resuming a bookmark, but in this example the synchronization events are required so the host knows whether the workflow is complete or whether it is waiting on more user input by using the <xref:System.Activities.Bookmark>. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] [Bookmarks](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/bookmarks.md).  \n  \n3.  Remove the call to `WaitOne`, and replace it with code to gather input from the user and resume the <xref:System.Activities.Bookmark>.  \n  \n     Remove the following line of code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/extrasnippets.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/extrasnippets.vb#10)]  \n  \n     Replace it with the following example.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#11](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#11)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#11](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#11)]  \n  \n##  <a name=\"BKMK_ToRunTheApplication\"></a> To build and run the application  \n  \n1.  Right-click **NumberGuessWorkflowHost** in **Solution Explorer** and select **Set as StartUp Project**.  \n  \n2.  Press CTRL+F5 to build and run the application. Try to guess the number in as few turns as possible.  \n  \n     To try the application with one of the other styles of workflow, replace `Workflow1` in the code that creates the <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication> with `FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow`, `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow`, or `StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow`, depending on which workflow style you desire.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/cs/program.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_WF_GettingStarted#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_wf_gettingstarted/vb/module1.vb#6)]  \n  \n     For instructions about how to add persistence to a workflow application, see the next topic, [How to: Create and Run a Long Running Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-and-run-a-long-running-workflow.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example is the complete code listing for the `Main` method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Please replace `Workflow1` in these examples with `FlowchartNumberGuessWorkflow`, `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow`, or `StateMachineNumberGuessWorkflow`, depending on which workflow you completed in the previous [How to: Create a Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow.md) step.
