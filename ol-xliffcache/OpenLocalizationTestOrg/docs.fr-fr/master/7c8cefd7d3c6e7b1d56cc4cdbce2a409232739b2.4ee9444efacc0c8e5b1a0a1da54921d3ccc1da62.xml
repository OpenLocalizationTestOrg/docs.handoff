For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n Unless you have a very specific reason for querying using XPath, such as extensive use of legacy code, using XPath with LINQ to XML is not recommended. XPath queries will not perform as well as [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] queries.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A> to select a set of elements.  \n  \n```csharp  \nXElement root = new XElement(\"Root\",  \n    new XElement(\"Child1\", 1),  \n    new XElement(\"Child1\", 2),  \n    new XElement(\"Child1\", 3),  \n    new XElement(\"Child2\", 4),  \n    new XElement(\"Child2\", 5),  \n    new XElement(\"Child2\", 6)  \n);  \nIEnumerable<XElement> list = root.XPathSelectElements(\"./Child2\");  \nforeach (XElement el in list)  \n    Console.WriteLine(el);  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \n<Child2>4</Child2>  \n<Child2>5</Child2>  \n<Child2>6</Child2>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,71],"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[356,398],"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#)","linkify":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Query LINQ to XML Using XPath (C#)","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"This topic introduces the extension methods that enable you to query an XML tree by using XPath.","pos":[399,495]},{"content":"For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>.","pos":[496,622],"source":" For detailed information about using these extension methods, see <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions?displayProperty=fullName>."},{"content":"Unless you have a very specific reason for querying using XPath, such as extensive use of legacy code, using XPath with LINQ to XML is not recommended.","pos":[629,780]},{"content":"XPath queries will not perform as well as <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)]</ph> queries.","pos":[781,934],"source":" XPath queries will not perform as well as [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] queries."},{"pos":[943,950],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A&gt;</ph> to select a set of elements.","pos":[954,1096],"source":"The following example creates a small XML tree and uses <xref:System.Xml.XPath.Extensions.XPathSelectElements%2A> to select a set of elements."},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[1495,1538]},{"pos":[1625,1633],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1637,1776],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Advanced Query Techniques (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/advanced-query-techniques-linq-to-xml.md)"}]}
