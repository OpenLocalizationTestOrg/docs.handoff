For more information, see [Batching Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/batching-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.ExecuteBatch%2A> method to execute an array of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest%601> objects that contains queries that return both `Customers` and `Products` objects from the Northwind data service. The collection of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> objects in the returned <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceResponse> is enumerated, and the collection of objects contained in each <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> is also enumerated.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#BatchQuery](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#batchquery)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#BatchQuery](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#batchquery)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WCF Data Services Client Library](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,234],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WCF Data Services, batch requests\"\nms.assetid: 3b4db7df-bd33-43a1-8ea4-63a18e131f97","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[241,295],"content":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","linkify":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Execute Queries in a Batch (WCF Data Services)","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"By using the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)]</ph> client library, you can execute more than one query against the data service in a single batch.","pos":[296,464],"source":"By using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library, you can execute more than one query against the data service in a single batch."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Batching Operations<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/batching-operations-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>.","pos":[465,591],"source":" For more information, see [Batching Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/batching-operations-wcf-data-services.md)."},{"content":"The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes.","pos":[598,709]},{"content":"This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WCF Data Services quickstart<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>.","pos":[710,885],"source":" This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md)."},{"pos":[894,901],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.ExecuteBatch%2A&gt;</ph> method to execute an array of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest%601&gt;</ph> objects that contains queries that return both <ph id=\"ph3\">`Customers`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">`Products`</ph> objects from the Northwind data service.","pos":[905,1221],"source":"The following example shows how to call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.ExecuteBatch%2A> method to execute an array of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceRequest%601> objects that contains queries that return both `Customers` and `Products` objects from the Northwind data service."},{"content":"The collection of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601&gt;</ph> objects in the returned <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceResponse&gt;</ph> is enumerated, and the collection of objects contained in each <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601&gt;</ph> is also enumerated.","pos":[1222,1525],"source":" The collection of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> objects in the returned <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceResponse> is enumerated, and the collection of objects contained in each <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601> is also enumerated."},{"pos":[1852,1860],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1864,1971],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WCF Data Services Client Library<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)</ept>","source":"[WCF Data Services Client Library](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)"}]}
