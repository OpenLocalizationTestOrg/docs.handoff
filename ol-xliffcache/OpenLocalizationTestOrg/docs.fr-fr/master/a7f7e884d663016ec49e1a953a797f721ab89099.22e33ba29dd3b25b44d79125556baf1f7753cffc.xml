Set the`DataSource` property to a data source object. Possible data sources include a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface. For more information, see [Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n2.  If you are binding to a table, set the`DisplayMember` property to the name of a column in the data source.  \n  \n     \\- or -  \n  \n     If you are binding to an <xref:System.Collections.IList>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub BindComboBox()  \n      ComboBox1.DataSource = DataSet1.Tables(\"Suppliers\")  \n      ComboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\"  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void BindComboBox()  \n    {  \n      comboBox1.DataSource = dataSet1.Tables[\"Suppliers\"];  \n      comboBox1.DisplayMember = \"ProductName\";  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you are bound to a data source that does not implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList> interface, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, the bound control's data will not be updated when the data source is updated. For example, if you have a combo box bound to an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList> and data is added to the <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, these new items will not appear in the combo box. However, you can force the combo box to be updated by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.SuspendBinding%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingManagerBase.ResumeBinding%2A> methods on the instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingContext> class to which the control is bound.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox>   \n [Windows Forms Data Binding](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/windows-forms-data-binding.md)   \n [Data Binding and Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-binding-and-windows-forms.md)   \n [Windows Forms Controls Used to List Options](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/windows-forms-controls-used-to-list-options.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,93],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,81]}]},{"pos":[819,883],"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","linkify":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind a Windows Forms ComboBox or ListBox Control to Data","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"You can bind the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox&gt;</ph> to data to perform tasks such as browsing data in a database, entering new data, or editing existing data.","pos":[884,1084],"source":"You can bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListBox> to data to perform tasks such as browsing data in a database, entering new data, or editing existing data."},{"pos":[1094,1131],"content":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","linkify":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","nodes":[{"content":"To bind a ComboBox or ListBox control","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"Set the<ph id=\"ph1\">`DataSource`</ph> property to a data source object.","pos":[1141,1194],"source":"Set the`DataSource` property to a data source object."},{"content":"Possible data sources include a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource&gt;</ph> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.IList&gt;</ph> interface.","pos":[1195,1428],"source":" Possible data sources include a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> bound to data, a data table, a data view, a dataset, a data view manager, an array, or any class that implements the <xref:System.Collections.IList> interface."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1429,1577],"source":" For more information, see [Data Sources Supported by Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/data-sources-supported-by-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1587,1693],"content":"If you are binding to a table, set the<ph id=\"ph1\">`DisplayMember`</ph> property to the name of a column in the data source.","source":"If you are binding to a table, set the`DisplayMember` property to the name of a column in the data source."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\-</ph> or -","pos":[1704,1711],"source":"\\- or -"},{"content":"If you are binding to an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.IList&gt;</ph>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list.","pos":[1722,1848],"source":"If you are binding to an <xref:System.Collections.IList>, set the display member to a public property of the type in the list."},{"pos":[2235,2997],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIf you are bound to a data source that does not implement the <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList> interface, such as an <xref:System.Collections.ArrayList>, the bound control's data will not be updated when the data source is updated.
