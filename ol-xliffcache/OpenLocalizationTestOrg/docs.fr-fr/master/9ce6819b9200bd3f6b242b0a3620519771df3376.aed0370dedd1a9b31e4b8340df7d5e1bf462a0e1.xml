References to `Me` or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a `Structure`.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36535  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to `Me` and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nStructure SampleStructure  \n    Public SearchValue As Integer  \n  \n    Public Sub SetSearchValue(ByVal number As Integer)  \n      SearchValue = number  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public Sub GetData()  \n        Dim sv = SearchValue  \n        Dim SampleData = New Integer() {1, 2, 3, 4}  \n        Dim query = From number In SampleData _  \n                    Where number < sv  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Structure  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)\n- [LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)\n- [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)\n- [Structure (Visual Basic)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,223],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36535\"\n  - \"bc36535\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36535\"\nms.assetid: afb5281b-70a7-48c7-a46d-39522b96b1ff","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[230,292],"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","linkify":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used in a query expression","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"A LINQ query in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Structure`</ph> includes a reference to <ph id=\"ph2\">`Me`</ph> or to an instance member of the structure.","pos":[293,394],"source":"A LINQ query in a `Structure` includes a reference to `Me` or to an instance member of the structure."},{"content":"References to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph> or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Structure`</ph>.","pos":[395,492],"source":" References to `Me` or instance members are not allowed in query expressions within a `Structure`."},{"pos":[499,520],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36535","source":"**Error ID:** BC36535"},{"pos":[529,550],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[560,720],"content":"Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph> and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example.","source":"Create a copy of the instance member or the value returned by the reference to `Me` and use the copy in the query expression, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[1148,1156],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1160,1283],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)</ept>","source":"[Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)"},{"pos":[1286,1362],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)"},{"pos":[1365,1457],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)</ept>","source":"[Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)"},{"pos":[1460,1559],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Structure (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Structure (Visual Basic)](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)"}]}
