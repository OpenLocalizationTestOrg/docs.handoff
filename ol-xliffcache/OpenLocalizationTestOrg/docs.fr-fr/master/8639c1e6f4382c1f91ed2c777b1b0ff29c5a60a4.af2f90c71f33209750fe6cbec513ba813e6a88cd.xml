If you want to display data that is not meant for modification, you must make the columns that contain the data read-only. For information about how to make the control entirely read-only, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md).  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To make a column read-only by using the designer  \n  \n1.  Click the smart tag glyph (![Smart Tag Glyph](./media/vs-winformsmttagglyph.gif \"VS_WinFormSmtTagGlyph\")) on the upper-right corner of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, and then select **Edit Columns**.  \n  \n2.  Select a column from the **Selected Columns** list.  \n  \n3.  In the **Column Properties** grid, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn.ReadOnly%2A> property to `true`.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can also make a column read-only when you add it by selecting the **Read Only** check box in the **Add Column** dialog box.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewColumn.ReadOnly%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [How to: Add and Remove Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](add-and-remove-columns-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)\n- [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)\n- [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)\n- [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,368],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Forms, columns\"\n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], read-only columns\"\n  - \"data [Windows Forms], displaying\"\n  - \"columns [Windows Forms], read-only\"\nms.assetid: b4ef7a75-ab33-4ee3-b2cf-201530e454e9","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,91],"content":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,91]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[375,466],"content":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make Columns Read-Only in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,91]}]},{"content":"By default, users can modify text and numerical data displayed in the Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[467,600],"source":"By default, users can modify text and numerical data displayed in the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control."},{"content":"If you want to display data that is not meant for modification, you must make the columns that contain the data read-only.","pos":[601,723]},{"content":"For information about how to make the control entirely read-only, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer<ept id=\"p1\">](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)</ept>.","pos":[724,972],"source":" For information about how to make the control entirely read-only, see [How to: Prevent Row Addition and Deletion in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control Using the Designer](prevent-row-addition-and-deletion-in-the-datagrid-using-the-designer.md)."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[979,1120],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Forms application project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1121,1381],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1389,1734],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
