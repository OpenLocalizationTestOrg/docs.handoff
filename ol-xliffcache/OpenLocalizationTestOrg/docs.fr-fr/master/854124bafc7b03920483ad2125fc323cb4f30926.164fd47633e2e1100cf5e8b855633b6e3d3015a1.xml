You can perform projections on the results of an [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] query either by using the `$select` query option or by using the [select](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/select-clause.md) clause ([Select](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/queries/select-clause.md) in Visual Basic) in a LINQ query. For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows a LINQ query that projects Customers entities into a new CustomerAddress type, which contains only address-specific properties plus the identity property. This `CustomerAddress` class is defined on the client and is attributed so that the client library can recognize it as an entity type.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#SelectCustomerAddress](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#selectcustomeraddress)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#SelectCustomerAddress](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#selectcustomeraddress)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows a LINQ query that projects returned Customers entities into a new CustomerAddressNonEntity type, which contains only address-specific properties and no identity property. This `CustomerAddressNonEntity` class is defined on the client and is not attributed as an entity type.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind
