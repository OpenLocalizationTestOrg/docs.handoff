Use it within your Windows-based application as a simple solution for users to set page preferences in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to set border and margin adjustments, headers and footers, and portrait vs. landscape orientation. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PageSetupDialog Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/pagesetupdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PageSetupDialog> component, which you can use to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to manipulate page settings.  \n  \n [How to: Determine Page Properties Using the PageSetupDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-determine-page-properties-using-the-pagesetupdialog-component.md)  \n Explains how to set page properties by using an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PageSetupDialog> component at run time.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PageSetupDialog>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [Dialog-Box Controls and Components](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/dialog-box-controls-and-components-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes a set of controls and components that allow users to perform standard interactions with the application or system.  \n  \n [Essential Code for Windows Forms Dialog Boxes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=102575)  \n Discusses the Windows Forms dialog box controls and components and the code necessary for executing their basic functions.
