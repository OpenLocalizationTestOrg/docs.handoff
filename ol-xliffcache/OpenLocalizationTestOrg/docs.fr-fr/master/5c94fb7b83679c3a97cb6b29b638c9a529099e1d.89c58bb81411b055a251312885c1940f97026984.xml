The Win32 implementation of `VirtualAlloc` reserves or commits a region of pages in the virtual address space of the calling process.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT VirtualAlloc (  \n    [in]  void*   pAddress,  \n    [in]  SIZE_T  dwSize,  \n    [in]  DWORD   flAllocationType,  \n    [in]  DWORD   flProtect,  \n    [in]  EMemoryCriticalLevel dwCriticalLevel,  \n    [out] void**  ppMem  \n);  \n  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `pAddress`  \n [in] A pointer to the starting address of the region to allocate.  \n  \n `dwSize`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the region.  \n  \n `flAllocationType`  \n [in] The type of memory allocation.  \n  \n `flProtect`  \n [in] Memory protection for the region of pages to be allocated.  \n  \n `dwCriticalLevel`  \n [in] An [EMemoryCriticalLevel](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ememorycriticallevel-enumeration.md) value that indicates the impact of an allocation failure.  \n  \n `ppMem`  \n [out] Pointer to the starting address of the allocated memory, or null if the request could not be satisfied.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|`VirtualAlloc` returned successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE|The common language runtime (CLR) has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.|  \n|HOST_E_TIMEOUT|The call timed out.|  \n|HOST_E_NOT_OWNER|The caller does not own the lock.|  \n|HOST_E_ABANDONED|An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.|  \n|E_FAIL|An unknown catastrophic failure occurred. When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Not enough memory was available to complete the allocation request|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n You reserve a region in the address space of your process by calling `VirtualAlloc`. The `pAddress` parameter contains the beginning address of the memory block you want. This parameter is typically set to null. The operating system keeps a record of free address ranges available to your process. A `pAddress` value of null instructs the system to reserve the region wherever it sees fit. Alternatively, you can provide a specific starting address for the memory block. In both cases, the output parameter `ppMem` is returned as a pointer to the allocated memory. The function itself returns an HRESULT value.  \n  \n The Win32 `VirtualAlloc` function does not have a `ppMem` parameter, and returns the pointer to the allocated memory instead. For more information, see the Windows Platform documentation.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n
