Using the Web hosting mode allows the COM+ application to be automatically activated as required.

All warnings will be output in addition to any errors encountered.  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```  \nComSvcConfig.exe /install /application:OnlineStore /contract:ItemOrders.Financial,IFinances /hosting:complus /verbose  \n```  \n  \n### Description  \n The following example adds the `IStockLevels` interface of the `ItemInventory.Warehouse` component (from the OnlineWarehouse COM+ application) to the set of interfaces that are exposed as Web services, using the Web hosting mode. The Web service is Web hosted in the OnlineWarehouse virtual directory of IIS.  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```  \nComSvcConfig.exe /install /application:OnlineWarehouse /contract:ItemInventory.Warehouse,IStockLevels /hosting:was /webDirectory:root/OnlineWarehouse  \n```  \n  \n### Description  \n The following example removes the `IFinances` interface of the `ItemOrders.Financial` component (from the OnlineStore COM+ application) from the set of interfaces that are exposed as Web services.  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```  \nComSvcConfig.exe /uninstall
