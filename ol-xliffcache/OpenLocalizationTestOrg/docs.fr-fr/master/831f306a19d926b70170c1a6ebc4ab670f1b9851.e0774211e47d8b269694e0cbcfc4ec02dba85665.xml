Each text line is stored into the string `line` and displayed on the screen.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```csharp\nint counter = 0;  \nstring line;  \n  \n// Read the file and display it line by line.  \nSystem.IO.StreamReader file =   \n    new System.IO.StreamReader(@\"c:\\test.txt\");  \nwhile((line = file.ReadLine()) != null)  \n{  \n    System.Console.WriteLine(line);  \n    counter++;  \n}  \n  \nfile.Close();  \nSystem.Console.WriteLine(\"There were {0} lines.\", counter);  \n// Suspend the screen.  \nSystem.Console.ReadLine();  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n Copy the code and paste it into the `Main` method of a console application.  \n  \n Replace `\"c:\\test.txt\"` with the actual file name.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The file may not exist.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file. For example, the file `myFile.cs` may not be a C# source file.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,247],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ReadLine method [C#]\"\n  - \"reading text files, line by line\"\n  - \"text files [C#]\"\nms.assetid: d62e22c5-a13c-48db-af9b-f10c801b0cb1","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,55],"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","pos":[0,55]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[254,309],"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","linkify":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read a Text File One Line at a Time (Visual C#)","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"This example reads the contents of a text file, one line at a time, into a string using the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReadLine`</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`StreamReader`</ph> class.","pos":[310,448],"source":"This example reads the contents of a text file, one line at a time, into a string using the `ReadLine` method of the `StreamReader` class."},{"content":"Each text line is stored into the string <ph id=\"ph1\">`line`</ph> and displayed on the screen.","pos":[449,525],"source":" Each text line is stored into the string `line` and displayed on the screen."},{"pos":[534,541],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[977,995],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[999,1074],"content":"Copy the code and paste it into the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method of a console application.","source":"Copy the code and paste it into the `Main` method of a console application."},{"pos":[1081,1131],"content":"Replace <ph id=\"ph1\">`\"c:\\test.txt\"`</ph> with the actual file name.","source":"Replace `\"c:\\test.txt\"` with the actual file name."},{"pos":[1140,1158],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1162,1210]},{"content":"The file may not exist.","pos":[1220,1243]},{"pos":[1252,1275],"content":".NET Framework Security","linkify":".NET Framework Security","nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Security","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file.","pos":[1279,1362]},{"content":"For example, the file <ph id=\"ph1\">`myFile.cs`</ph> may not be a C# source file.","pos":[1363,1425],"source":" For example, the file `myFile.cs` may not be a C# source file."},{"pos":[1434,1442],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1494,1560],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1563,1672],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)</ept>","source":"[File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)"}]}
