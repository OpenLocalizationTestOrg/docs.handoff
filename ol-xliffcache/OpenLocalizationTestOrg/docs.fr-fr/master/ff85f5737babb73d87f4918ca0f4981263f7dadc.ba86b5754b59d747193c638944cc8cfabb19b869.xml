However, you can create your own application domains and load into them those assemblies that you want to manage personally. You can also create application domains from which you execute code.  \n  \n You create a new application domain using one of the overloaded **CreateDomain** methods in the <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=nameWithType> class. You can give the application domain a name and reference it by that name.  \n  \n The following example creates a new application domain, assigns it the name `MyDomain`, and then prints the name of the host domain and the newly created child application domain to the console.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[ADCreateDomain#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADCreateDomain/CPP/source2.cpp#2)]\n [!code-csharp[ADCreateDomain#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADCreateDomain/CS/source2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[ADCreateDomain#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/ADCreateDomain/VB/source2.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Programming with Application Domains](application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)\n- [Using Application Domains](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,262],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create an Application Domain\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application domains, creating\"\nms.assetid: ba1fa43e-49f5-47d9-bd7f-3024af16f4ba\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an Application Domain","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"How to: Create an Application Domain","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an Application Domain","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[269,305],"content":"How to: Create an Application Domain","linkify":"How to: Create an Application Domain","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an Application Domain","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"A common language runtime host creates application domains automatically when they are needed.","pos":[306,400]},{"content":"However, you can create your own application domains and load into them those assemblies that you want to manage personally.","pos":[401,525]},{"content":"You can also create application domains from which you execute code.","pos":[526,594]},{"content":"You create a new application domain using one of the overloaded <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>CreateDomain<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> methods in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[601,756],"source":"You create a new application domain using one of the overloaded **CreateDomain** methods in the <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=nameWithType> class."},{"content":"You can give the application domain a name and reference it by that name.","pos":[757,830]},{"pos":[837,1031],"content":"The following example creates a new application domain, assigns it the name <ph id=\"ph1\">`MyDomain`</ph>, and then prints the name of the host domain and the newly created child application domain to the console.","source":"The following example creates a new application domain, assigns it the name `MyDomain`, and then prints the name of the host domain and the newly created child application domain to the console."},{"pos":[1040,1047],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1400,1408],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1412,1511],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming with Application Domains<ept id=\"p1\">](application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)</ept>","source":"[Programming with Application Domains](application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)"},{"pos":[1514,1585],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Domains<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Application Domains](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)"}]}
