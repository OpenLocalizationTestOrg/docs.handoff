For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To add or remove nodes in the designer  \n  \n1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property.  \n  \n     The **TreeNode Editor** appears.  \n  \n3.  To add nodes, a root node must exist; if one does not exist, you must first add a root by clicking the **Add Root** button. You can then add child nodes by selecting the root or any other node and clicking the **Add Child** button.  \n  \n4.  To delete nodes, select the node to delete and then click the **Delete** button.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [TreeView Control](treeview-control-windows-forms.md)\n- [TreeView Control Overview](treeview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Set Icons for the Windows Forms TreeView Control](how-to-set-icons-for-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)\n- [How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control](how-to-iterate-through-all-nodes-of-a-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)\n- [How to: Determine Which TreeView Node Was Clicked](how-to-determine-which-treeview-node-was-clicked-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Add Custom Information to a TreeView or ListView Control (Windows Forms)](add-custom-information-to-a-treeview-or-listview-control-wf.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,387],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], TreeView control\"\n  - \"TreeView control [Windows Forms], removing nodes\"\n  - \"tree nodes in TreeView control\"\n  - \"TreeView control [Windows Forms], adding nodes\"\nms.assetid: 35bf1750-045e-4ec5-97cb-b47b0dbdaa2c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,87],"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,87]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[394,481],"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,87]}]},{"pos":[482,663],"content":"Because the Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control displays nodes in a hierarchical manner, when adding a node you must pay attention to what its parent node is.","source":"Because the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control displays nodes in a hierarchical manner, when adding a node you must pay attention to what its parent node is."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[670,807],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Forms application project<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[808,1068],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms application project](/visualstudio/ide/step-1-create-a-windows-forms-application-project) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1076,1421],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
