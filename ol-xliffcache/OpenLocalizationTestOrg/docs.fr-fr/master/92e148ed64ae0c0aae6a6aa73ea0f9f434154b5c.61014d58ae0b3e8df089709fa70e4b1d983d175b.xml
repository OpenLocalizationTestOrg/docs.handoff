The <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> and <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> classes inherit from the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class. To display a vector image, you need an instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class and a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile>. To display a raster image, you need an instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class and a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>. The instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method, which receives the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> or <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> as an argument.  \n  \n## File Types and Cloning  \n The following code example shows how to construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> from the file Climber.jpg and displays the bitmap. The destination point for the upper-left corner of the image, (10, 10), is specified in the second and third parameters.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the image.  \n  \n ![Image Sample](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip03-art04.gif \"AboutGdip03_Art04\")  \n  \n You can construct <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> objects from a variety of graphics file formats: BMP, GIF, JPEG, EXIF, PNG, TIFF, and ICON.  \n  \n The following code example shows how to construct <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> objects from a variety of file types and then displays the bitmaps.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles/CS/Class1.cs#12)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles#12](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ImagesBitmapsMetafiles/VB/Class1.vb#12)]  \n  \n The <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> class provides a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.Clone%2A> method that you can use to make a copy of an existing <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>. The <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap.Clone%2A> method has a source rectangle parameter that you can use to specify the portion of the original bitmap that you want to copy. The following code example shows how to create a <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> by cloning the top half of an existing <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>. Then both images are drawn.  \n  \n
