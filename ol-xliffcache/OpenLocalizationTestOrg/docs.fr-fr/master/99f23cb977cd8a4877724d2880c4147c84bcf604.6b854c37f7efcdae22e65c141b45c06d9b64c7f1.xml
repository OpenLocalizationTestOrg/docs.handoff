This topic provides an overview of the keyboard events, including details on when to use each event and the data that is supplied for each event.  Also see [Event Handlers Overview (Windows Forms)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/be6fx1bb\\(v=vs.110\\)), [Events Overview (Windows Forms)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1h12f09z\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Keyboard Events  \n Windows Forms provides two events that occur when a user presses a keyboard key and one event when a user releases a keyboard key:  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event occurs once  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event, which can occur multiple times when a user holds down the same key.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp> event occurs once when a user releases a key.  \n  \n When a user presses a key, Windows Forms determines which event to raise based on whether the keyboard message specifies a character key or a physical key. For more information about character and physical keys, see [How Keyboard Input Works](../../../docs/framework/winforms/how-keyboard-input-works.md).  \n  \n The following table describes the three keyboard events.  \n  \n|Keyboard event|Description|Results|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|-------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>|This event is raised when a user presses a physical key.|The handler for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> receives:<br /><br /> <ul><li>A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> parameter, which provides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.KeyCode%2A> property (which specifies a physical keyboard button).</li><li>The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Modifiers%2A> property (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT).</li><li>The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.KeyData%2A> property (which combines the key code and modifier). The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> parameter also provides:<br /><br /> <ul><li>The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Handled%2A> property, which can be set to prevent the underlying control from receiving the key.</li><li>The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.SuppressKeyPress%2A> property, which can be used to suppress the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp> events for that keystroke.</li></ul></li></ul>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress>|This event is raised when the key or keys pressed result in a character. For example, a user presses SHIFT and the lowercase \"a\" keys, which result in a capital letter \"A\" character.|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> is raised after <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>.<br /><br /> <ul><li>The handler for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> receives:</li><li>A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyPressEventArgs> parameter, which contains the character code of the key that was pressed. This character code is unique for every combination of a character key and a modifier key.<br /><br />     For example, the \"A\" key will generate:<br /><br /> <ul><li>The character code 65, if it is pressed with the SHIFT key</li><li>Or the CAPS LOCK key, 97 if it is pressed by itself,</li><li>And 1, if it is pressed with the CTRL key.</li></ul></li></ul>|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp>|This event is raised when a user releases a physical key.|The handler for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp> receives:<br /><br /> <ul><li>A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs> parameter:<br /><br /> <ul><li>Which provides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.KeyCode%2A> property (which specifies a physical keyboard button).</li><li>The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs.Modifiers%2A> property (SHIFT, CTRL, or ALT).</li><li>The <xref:System.Globalization.SortKey.KeyData%2A> property (which combines the key
