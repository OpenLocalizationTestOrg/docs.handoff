The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace allow an application to use URLs that do not directly correspond to a physical resource. Using Web routing allows the developer to create virtual addresses for HTTP that are then mapped back to actual [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services. This is useful when a WCF service must be hosted without requiring a physical file or resource, or when services must be accessed with URLs that do not contain files such as .html or .aspx. This sample demonstrates how to utilize the <xref:System.Web.Routing.RouteTable> class to create virtual URIs that map to running services defined in global.asax. For this example, there are two RSS feeds created using WCF: a `movies` feed and a `channels` feed. The URLs to activate the services do not contain an extension and are registered in the `Application_Start` method of the `Global` class derived from the <xref:System.Web.HttpApplication> class.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace only work for services hosted over HTTP.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This sample only works in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)], as [!INCLUDE[iis60](../../../../includes/iis60-md.md)] uses a different method for supporting extension-less URLs.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WCF\\Basic\\Services\\Hosting\\WebRoutingIntegration`  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the WebRoutingIntegration.sln file.  \n  \n2.  To run the solution and start the Web development server, press F5.  \n  \n     A directory listing for the sample appears. Note that there are no files with an .svc file extension.  \n  \n3.  In the address bar, add `movies` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/movies and press ENTER.  \n  \n     The movies feed appears in the browser.  \n  \n4.  In the address bar, add `channels` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/channels and press ENTER.  \n  \n     The channels feed appears in the browser.  \n  \n5.  Close the Web browser, by pressing ALT+F4.  \n  \n     If the development server has not exited, right-click the notification area icon and select **Stop**.  \n  \n#### To use this sample when hosted in IIS  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the WebRoutingIntegration.sln file.  \n  \n2.  Build the project, by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n3.  Create a Web application in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.  \n  \n    1.  In IIS Manager, right click the **Default Web Site** and select **Add an Application**.  \n  \n    2.  For the **alias**, type in `WebRoutingIntegration`.  \n  \n    3.  For the **Physical Path**, select the Service folder inside the project.  \n  \n    4.  Press **OK**.  \n  \n4.  Start the application, by right-clicking the Web application and selecting **Manage Application** and then **Browse**.  \n  \n5.  In the address bar, add `movies` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/movies and press ENTER.  \n  \n     The movies feed appears in the browser.  \n  \n6.  In the address bar, add `channels` to the URL, so that is reads http://localhost:[port]/channels and press ENTER.  \n  \n     The channels feed appears in the browser.  \n  \n7.  Close the Web browser, by pressing ALT+F4.  \n  \n This sample demonstrates that the hosting layer is capable of composing with the classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace for routing the requests of services hosted over HTTP.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Please update the default application pool version to [!INCLUDE[netfx40_long](../../../../includes/netfx40-long-md.md)] if it’s set to version 2.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [AppFabric Hosting and Persistence Samples](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=193961)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"SystemWebRouting Integration Sample | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"SystemWebRouting Integration Sample | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[363,398],"content":"SystemWebRouting Integration Sample","linkify":"SystemWebRouting Integration Sample","nodes":[{"content":"SystemWebRouting Integration Sample","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates the hosting layer’s integration with the classes in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Routing&gt;</ph> namespace.","pos":[399,516],"source":"This sample demonstrates the hosting layer’s integration with the classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace."},{"content":"The classes in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Routing&gt;</ph> namespace allow an application to use URLs that do not directly correspond to a physical resource.","pos":[517,660],"source":" The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace allow an application to use URLs that do not directly correspond to a physical resource."},{"content":"Using Web routing allows the developer to create virtual addresses for HTTP that are then mapped back to actual <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph> services.","pos":[661,838],"source":" Using Web routing allows the developer to create virtual addresses for HTTP that are then mapped back to actual [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services."},{"content":"This is useful when a WCF service must be hosted without requiring a physical file or resource, or when services must be accessed with URLs that do not contain files such as .html or .aspx.","pos":[839,1028]},{"content":"This sample demonstrates how to utilize the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Routing.RouteTable&gt;</ph> class to create virtual URIs that map to running services defined in global.asax.","pos":[1029,1191],"source":" This sample demonstrates how to utilize the <xref:System.Web.Routing.RouteTable> class to create virtual URIs that map to running services defined in global.asax."},{"content":"For this example, there are two RSS feeds created using WCF: a <ph id=\"ph1\">`movies`</ph> feed and a <ph id=\"ph2\">`channels`</ph> feed.","pos":[1192,1291],"source":" For this example, there are two RSS feeds created using WCF: a `movies` feed and a `channels` feed."},{"content":"The URLs to activate the services do not contain an extension and are registered in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Application_Start`</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Global`</ph> class derived from the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Web.HttpApplication&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[1292,1486],"source":" The URLs to activate the services do not contain an extension and are registered in the `Application_Start` method of the `Global` class derived from the <xref:System.Web.HttpApplication> class."},{"pos":[1494,1600],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace only work for services hosted over HTTP.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"The classes in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Routing&gt;</ph> namespace only work for services hosted over HTTP.","pos":[9,104],"source":" The classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace only work for services hosted over HTTP."}]},{"pos":[1608,1814],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This sample only works in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)], as [!INCLUDE[iis60](../../../../includes/iis60-md.md)] uses a different method for supporting extension-less URLs.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"This sample only works in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)]</ph>, as <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[iis60](../../../../includes/iis60-md.md)]</ph> uses a different method for supporting extension-less URLs.","pos":[9,204],"source":" This sample only works in [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)], as [!INCLUDE[iis60](../../../../includes/iis60-md.md)] uses a different method for supporting extension-less URLs."}]},{"pos":[1822,1955],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your computer.
