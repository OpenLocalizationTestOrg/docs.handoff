For information on classes that provide additional features, see [Threading Objects and Features](../../../docs/standard/threading/threading-objects-and-features.md) and [Overview of Synchronization Primitives](../../../docs/standard/threading/overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md).  \n  \n The rest of the topics in this section cover advanced topics, including the interaction of managed threading with the Windows operating system.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], the Task Parallel Library and PLINQ provide APIs for task and data parallelism in multi-threaded programs. For more information, see [Parallel Programming](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Threads and Threading](../../../docs/standard/threading/threads-and-threading.md)  \n Discusses the advantages and drawbacks of multiple threads, and outlines the scenarios in which you might create threads or use thread pool threads.  \n  \n [Exceptions in Managed Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/exceptions-in-managed-threads.md)  \n Describes the behavior of unhandled exceptions in threads for different versions of the .NET Framework, in particular the situations in which they result in termination of the application.  \n  \n [Synchronizing Data for Multithreading](../../../docs/standard/threading/synchronizing-data-for-multithreading.md)  \n Describes strategies for synchronizing data in classes that will be used with multiple threads.  \n  \n [Managed Thread States](../../../docs/standard/threading/managed-thread-states.md)  \n Describes the basic thread states, and explains how to detect whether a thread is running.  \n  \n [Foreground and Background Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/foreground-and-background-threads.md)  \n Explains the differences between foreground and background threads.  \n  \n [Managed and Unmanaged Threading in Windows](../../../docs/standard/threading/managed-and-unmanaged-threading-in-windows.md)  \n Discusses the relationship between managed and unmanaged threading, lists managed equivalents for Windows threading APIs, and discusses the interaction of COM apartments and managed threads.  \n  \n [Thread.Suspend, Garbage Collection, and Safe Points](../../../docs/standard/threading/thread-suspend-garbage-collection-and-safe-points.md)  \n Describes thread suspension and garbage collection.  \n  \n [Thread Local Storage: Thread-Relative Static Fields and Data Slots](../../../docs/standard/threading/thread-local-storage-thread-relative-static-fields-and-data-slots.md)  \n Describes thread-relative storage mechanisms.  \n  \n [Cancellation in Managed Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads.md)  \n Describes how asynchronous or long-running synchronous operations can be canceled by using a cancellation token.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Threading.Thread>  \n Provides reference documentation for the **Thread** class, which represents a managed thread, whether it came from unmanaged code or was created in a managed application.  \n  \n <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker>  \n Provides a safe way to implement multithreading in conjunction with user-interface objects.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Overview of Synchronization Primitives](../../../docs/standard/threading/overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md)  \n Describes the managed classes used to synchronize the activities of multiple threads.  \n  \n [Managed Threading Best Practices](../../../docs/standard/threading/managed-threading-best-practices.md)  \n Describes common problems with multithreading and strategies for avoiding problems.  \n  \n [Parallel Programming](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/index.md)  \n Describes the Task Parallel Library and PLINQ, which greatly simplify the work of creating asynchronous and multi-threaded .NET Framework applications.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,53],"content":"Managed Threading Basics | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Managed Threading Basics | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[515,539],"content":"Managed Threading Basics","linkify":"Managed Threading Basics","nodes":[{"content":"Managed Threading Basics","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"The first five topics of this section are designed to help you determine when to use managed threading, and to explain some basic features.","pos":[540,679]},{"content":"For information on classes that provide additional features, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Threading Objects and Features<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/threading/threading-objects-and-features.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Overview of Synchronization Primitives<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../docs/standard/threading/overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md)</ept>.","pos":[680,967],"source":" For information on classes that provide additional features, see [Threading Objects and Features](../../../docs/standard/threading/threading-objects-and-features.md) and [Overview of Synchronization Primitives](../../../docs/standard/threading/overview-of-synchronization-primitives.md)."},{"content":"The rest of the topics in this section cover advanced topics, including the interaction of managed threading with the Windows operating system.","pos":[974,1117]},{"pos":[1125,1417],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], the Task Parallel Library and PLINQ provide APIs for task and data parallelism in multi-threaded programs.
