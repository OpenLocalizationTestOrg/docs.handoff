Create your assembly. For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md).  \n  \n2.  Assign a strong name to your assembly. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md).  \n  \n3.  Assign version information to your assembly. For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](../../../../framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md).  \n  \n4.  Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md).  \n  \n5.  Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications. For more information, see [How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Programming Concepts](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/index.md)\n- [Assemblies in .NET](../../../../standard/assembly/index.md)\n- [Programming with Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,146],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: 5388aedc-cb42-4622-8b70-8e701eee057a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[153,217],"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share an Assembly with Other Applications (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"Assemblies can be private or shared: by default, most simple programs consist of a private assembly because they are not intended to be used by other applications.","pos":[218,381]},{"pos":[388,540],"content":"In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Global Assembly Cache<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/gac.md)</ept> (GAC).","source":"In order to share an assembly with other applications, it must be placed in the [Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/gac.md) (GAC)."},{"pos":[550,569],"content":"Sharing an assembly","linkify":"Sharing an assembly","nodes":[{"content":"Sharing an assembly","pos":[0,19]}]},{"content":"Create your assembly.","pos":[579,600]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Creating Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md)</ept>.","pos":[601,705],"source":" For more information, see [Creating Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/create-assemblies.md)."},{"content":"Assign a strong name to your assembly.","pos":[715,753]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>.","pos":[754,907],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)."},{"content":"Assign version information to your assembly.","pos":[917,961]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Assembly Versioning<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md)</ept>.","pos":[962,1068],"source":" For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](../../../../framework/app-domains/assembly-versioning.md)."},{"content":"Add your assembly to the Global Assembly Cache.","pos":[1078,1125]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)</ept>.","pos":[1126,1291],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)."},{"content":"Access the types contained in the assembly from the other applications.","pos":[1301,1372]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md)</ept>.","pos":[1373,1522],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Reference a Strong-Named Assembly](../../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-reference-a-strong-named-assembly.md)."},{"pos":[1531,1539],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1543,1627],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming Concepts<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Programming Concepts](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/index.md)"},{"pos":[1630,1690],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Assemblies in .NET<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../standard/assembly/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Assemblies in .NET](../../../../standard/assembly/index.md)"},{"pos":[1693,1788],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming with Assemblies<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)</ept>","source":"[Programming with Assemblies](../../../../framework/app-domains/programming-with-assemblies.md)"}]}
