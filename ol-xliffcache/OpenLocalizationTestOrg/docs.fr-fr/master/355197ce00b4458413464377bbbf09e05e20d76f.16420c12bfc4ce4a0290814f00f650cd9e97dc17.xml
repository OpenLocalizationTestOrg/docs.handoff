XML Encryption is a standard way to exchange or store encrypted XML data, without worrying about the data being easily read.  For more information about the XML Encryption standard, see the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specification for XML Encryption located at http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/.  \n  \n This example decrypts an XML element that was encrypted using the methods described in: [How to: Encrypt XML Elements with X.509 Certificates](../../../docs/standard/security/how-to-encrypt-xml-elements-with-x-509-certificates.md).  It finds an <`EncryptedData`> element, decrypts the element, and then replaces the element with the original plaintext XML element.  \n  \n The code example in this procedure decrypts an XML element using an X.509 certificate from the local certificate store of the current user account.  The example uses the <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.EncryptedXml.DecryptDocument%2A> method to automatically retrieve the X.509 certificate and decrypt a session key stored in the <`EncryptedKey`> element of the <`EncryptedData`> element.  The <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Xml.EncryptedXml.DecryptDocument%2A> method then automatically uses the session key to decrypt the XML element.  \n  \n This example is appropriate for situations where multiple applications need to share encrypted data or where an application needs to save encrypted data between the times that it runs.  \n  \n### To decrypt an XML element with an X.509 certificate  \n  \n1.  Create an <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object by loading an XML file from disk.  The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> object contains the XML element to decrypt.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[HowToDecryptXMLElementX509#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/HowToDecryptXMLElementX509/cs/sample.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[HowToDecryptXMLElementX509#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/HowToDecryptXMLElementX509/vb/sample.vb#2)]  \n  \n2.

It also assumes that `\"test.xml\"` contains a `\"creditcard\"` element.  You can place the following XML into a file called `test.xml` and use it with this example.  \n  \n```  \n<root>  \n    <creditcard>  \n        <number>19834209</number>  \n        <expiry>02/02/2002</expiry>  \n    </creditcard>  \n</root>  \n```  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HowToDecryptXMLElementX509#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/HowToDecryptXMLElementX509/cs/sample.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[HowToDecryptXMLElementX509#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/HowToDecryptXMLElementX509/vb/sample.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n  \n-   To compile this example, you need to include a reference to `System.Security.dll`.  \n  \n-   Include the following namespaces: <xref:System.Xml>, <xref:System.Security.Cryptography>, and <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.Xml>.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n The X.509 certificate used in this example is for test purposes only.
