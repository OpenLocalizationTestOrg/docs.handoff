Using multiple threads of execution is one of the most powerful ways to keep your application responsive to the user and at the same time make use of the processor in between or even during user events. While this section introduces the basic concepts of threading, it focuses on managed threading concepts and using managed threading.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], multithreaded programming is greatly simplified with the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes, [Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/parallel-linq-plinq.md), new concurrent collection classes in the <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace, and a new programming model that is based on the concept of tasks rather than threads.
