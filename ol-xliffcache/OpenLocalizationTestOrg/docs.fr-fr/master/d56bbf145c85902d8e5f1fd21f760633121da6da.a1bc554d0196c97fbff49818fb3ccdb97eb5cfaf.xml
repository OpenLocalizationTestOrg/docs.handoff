However, it indicates that the chosen poison message disposition failed for a message. See [Poison-Message Handling](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,142],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: d75d39da-7502-4a6a-91b9-eaa05b8e24d5","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[149,207],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.MsmqMoveOrDeleteAttemptFailed","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"Cannot move or delete message.","pos":[208,238]},{"pos":[247,258],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"The trace indicates that a failure occurred when attempting to move, delete, or reject an MSMQ message.","pos":[262,365]},{"pos":[372,643],"content":"MSMQ messages are employed by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) (when used with either the NetMsmqBinding or the MsmqIntegrationBinding).This trace is related to the chosen value of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReceiveErrorHandling`</ph> property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding.","source":"MSMQ messages are employed by Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) (when used with either the NetMsmqBinding or the MsmqIntegrationBinding).This trace is related to the chosen value of the `ReceiveErrorHandling` property on the NetMsmqBinding or MsmqIntegrationBinding."},{"content":"This trace is not indicative of an overall system failure.","pos":[650,708]},{"content":"However, it indicates that the chosen poison message disposition failed for a message.","pos":[709,795]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Poison-Message Handling<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546)</ept> for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately.","pos":[796,984],"source":" See [Poison-Message Handling](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=99546) for more details on when messages become poison and how to configure your service to handle them appropriately."},{"pos":[993,1001],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1005,1078],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[1081,1234],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[1237,1325],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
