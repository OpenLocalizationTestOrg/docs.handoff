Views allow for the functionalities of grouping, sorting, filtering, and the notion of a current item.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the static resource named *places* is defined as a collection of *Place* objects, in which each *Place* object is consisted of a city name and the state. The prefix *src* is mapped to the namespace where the data source *Places* is defined. The prefix *scm* maps to `\"clr-namespace:System.ComponentModel;assembly=WindowsBase\"` and *dat* maps to `\"clr-namespace:System.Windows.Data;assembly=PresentationFramework\"`.  \n  \n The following example creates a view of the data collection that is sorted by the city name and grouped by the state.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[CollectionViewSource#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionViewSource/CS/window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The view can then be a binding source, as in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-xaml[CollectionViewSource#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionViewSource/CS/window1.xaml#2)]  \n  \n For bindings to XML data defined in an <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider> resource, precede the XML name with an @ symbol.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[CollectionViewSource#XDPChunk](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionViewSource/CS/window1.xaml#xdpchunk)]  \n  \n [!code-xaml[CollectionViewSource#Attribute](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CollectionViewSource/CS/window1.xaml#attribute)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionViewSource>\n- [Get the Default View of a Data Collection](how-to-get-the-default-view-of-a-data-collection.md)\n- [Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,498],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Sort and Group Data Using a View in XAML\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
