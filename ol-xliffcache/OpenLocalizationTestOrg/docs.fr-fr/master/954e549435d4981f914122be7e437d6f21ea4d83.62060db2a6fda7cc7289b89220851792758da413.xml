You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a `With`...`End With` block.  \n  \n### To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable  \n  \n1.  Declare a variable of the type of the object that you are accessing frequently. Specify the qualification path in the initialization part of the declaration.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Dim ctrlActv As Control = someForm.ActiveForm.ActiveControl  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Use the variable to access the object's members.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ctrlActv.Text = \"Test\"  \n    ctrlActv.Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n    ctrlActv.Show()  \n    ```  \n  \n### To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block  \n  \n1.  Put the qualification path in a `With` statement.  \n  \n    ```  \n    With someForm.ActiveForm.ActiveControl  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Access the object's members inside the `With` block, before the `End With` statement.  \n  \n    ```  \n        .Text = \"Test\"  \n        .Location = New Point(100, 100)  \n        .Show()  \n    End With  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)   \n [With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,769],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,99],"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,99]}]}],"pos":[6,108],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"variables [Visual Basic], accessing\"\n  - \"variables [Visual Basic], object\"\n  - \"With statement\"\n  - \"With block\"\n  - \"object variables, accessing\"\nms.assetid: 3eb7657f-c9fe-4e05-8bc3-4bb14d5ae585\ncaps.latest.revision: 13\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[776,858],"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Speed Up Access to an Object with a Long Qualification Path (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,82]}]},{"content":"If you frequently access an object that requires a qualification path of several methods and properties, you can speed up your code by not repeating the qualification path.","pos":[859,1031]},{"content":"There are two ways you can avoid repeating the qualification path.","pos":[1038,1104]},{"content":"You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph>...<ph id=\"ph2\">`End With`</ph> block.","pos":[1105,1195],"source":" You can assign the object to a variable, or you can use it in a `With`...`End With` block."},{"pos":[1205,1283],"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","linkify":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","nodes":[{"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by assigning it to a variable","pos":[0,78]}]},{"content":"Declare a variable of the type of the object that you are accessing frequently.","pos":[1293,1372]},{"content":"Specify the qualification path in the initialization part of the declaration.","pos":[1373,1450]},{"content":"Use the variable to access the object's members.","pos":[1549,1597]},{"pos":[1727,1808],"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","linkify":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","nodes":[{"content":"To speed up access to a heavily qualified object by using a With...End With block","pos":[0,81]}]},{"pos":[1818,1867],"content":"Put the qualification path in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> statement.","source":"Put the qualification path in a `With` statement."},{"pos":[1945,2030],"content":"Access the object's members inside the <ph id=\"ph1\">`With`</ph> block, before the <ph id=\"ph2\">`End With`</ph> statement.","source":"Access the object's members inside the `With` block, before the `End With` statement."},{"pos":[2162,2170],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Object Variables<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2174,2285],"source":"[Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>With...End With Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[2289,2399],"source":"[With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)"}]}
