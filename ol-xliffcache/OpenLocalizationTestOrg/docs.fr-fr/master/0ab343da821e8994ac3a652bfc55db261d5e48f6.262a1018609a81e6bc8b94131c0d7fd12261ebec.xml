This topic describes differences in the way such certificates are validated.  \n  \n## Validation of HTTPS Client Certificates  \n When using HTTPS to communicate between a client and a service, the certificate that the client uses to authenticate to the service must support chain trust. That is, it must chain to a trusted root certificate authority. If not, the HTTP layer raises a <xref:System.Net.WebException> with the message \"The remote server returned an error: (403) Forbidden.\" WCF surfaces this exception as a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.MessageSecurityException>.  \n  \n## Validation of HTTPS Service Certificates  \n When using HTTPS to communicate between a client and a service, the certificate that the server authenticates with must support chain trust by default. That is, it must chain to a trusted root certificate authority. No online check is performed to see whether the certificate has been revoked. You can override this behavior by registering a <xref:System.Net.Security.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback> callback, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_CertificateValidationDifferences#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_certificatevalidationdifferences/cs/source.cs#1)] \n [!code-vb[c_CertificateValidationDifferences#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_certificatevalidationdifferences/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n where the signature for `ValidateServerCertificate` is as follows:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_CertificateValidationDifferences#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_certificatevalidationdifferences/cs/source.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[c_CertificateValidationDifferences#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_certificatevalidationdifferences/vb/source.vb#2)]  \n  \n Implementing `ValidateServerCertificate` can perform any checks that the client application developer deems necessary to validate the service certificate.  \n  \n## Validation of Client Certificates in SSL over TCP or SOAP Security  \n When using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) over TCP or message (SOAP) security, client certificates are validated according to the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509ClientCertificateAuthentication.CertificateValidationMode%2A> property value of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509ClientCertificateAuthentication> class.
