You can do this conversion easily by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.Save%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class and specifying the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat> for the desired image file format.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example loads a BMP image from a type, and saves the image in the PNG format.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/CS/Form1.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/VB/Form1.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A Windows Forms application.  \n  \n-   A reference to the `System.Drawing.Imaging` namespace.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: List Installed Encoders](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)\n- [Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)\n- [Types of Bitmaps](types-of-bitmaps.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,290],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BMP images [Windows Forms], converting to PNG\"\n  - \"image formats [Windows Forms], converting between\"\nms.assetid: 9d4a692d-73ac-4ce3-9e05-9ec321e8fbd6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","pos":[0,42]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[297,339],"content":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","linkify":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Convert a BMP image to a PNG image","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"Oftentimes, you will want to convert from one image file format to another.","pos":[340,415]},{"content":"You can do this conversion easily by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image.Save%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Image&gt;</ph> class and specifying the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat&gt;</ph> for the desired image file format.","pos":[416,644],"source":" You can do this conversion easily by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.Save%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class and specifying the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat> for the desired image file format."},{"pos":[653,660],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example loads a BMP image from a type, and saves the image in the PNG format.","pos":[664,755]},{"pos":[1040,1058],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1062,1084]},{"content":"A Windows Forms application.","pos":[1094,1122]},{"pos":[1132,1186],"content":"A reference to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`System.Drawing.Imaging`</ph> namespace.","source":"A reference to the `System.Drawing.Imaging` namespace."},{"pos":[1195,1203],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1207,1275],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: List Installed Encoders<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: List Installed Encoders](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)"},{"pos":[1278,1382],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)"},{"pos":[1385,1424],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Types of Bitmaps<ept id=\"p1\">](types-of-bitmaps.md)</ept>","source":"[Types of Bitmaps](types-of-bitmaps.md)"}]}
