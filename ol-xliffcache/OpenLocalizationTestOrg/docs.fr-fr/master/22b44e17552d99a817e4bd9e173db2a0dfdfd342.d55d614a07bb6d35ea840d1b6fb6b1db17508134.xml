See \"Comparing Objects\" in [Comparison Operators in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/comparison-operators.md).  \n  \n When a variable or expression evaluates to `Object`, the compiler must perform *late binding*, which causes extra operations at run time. It also exposes your application to potential run-time errors. For example, if you assign a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> to an `Object` variable and then try to use it with the `<>` operator, the runtime throws an <xref:System.InvalidCastException> because Visual Basic cannot convert a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> object to a data type suitable for value comparison. Even if both operands evaluate to type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>, the operation fails because `<>` is not defined for <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form> operands.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
