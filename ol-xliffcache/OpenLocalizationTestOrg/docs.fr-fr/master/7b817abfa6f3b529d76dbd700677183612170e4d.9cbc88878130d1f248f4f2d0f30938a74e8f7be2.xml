Some examples of this in code are: `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`, which is a kind of `Exception`, and `SerializableAttribute`, which is a kind of `Attribute`. However, it is important to use reasonable judgment in applying this guideline; for example, the `Button` class is a kind of `Control` event, although `Control` doesn’t appear in its name.  \n  \n **✓ DO** prefix interface names with the letter I, to indicate that the type is an interface.  \n  \n For example, `IComponent` (descriptive noun), `ICustomAttributeProvider` (noun phrase), and `IPersistable` (adjective) are appropriate interface names. As with other type names, avoid abbreviations.  \n  \n **✓ DO** ensure that the names differ only by the \"I\" prefix on the interface name when you are defining a class–interface pair where the class is a standard implementation of the interface.  \n  \n## Names of Generic Type Parameters  \n Generics were added to .NET Framework 2.0. The feature introduced a new kind of identifier called *type parameter*.  \n  \n **✓ DO** name generic type parameters with descriptive names unless a single-letter name is completely self-explanatory and a descriptive name would not add value.  \n  \n **✓ CONSIDER** using `T` as the type parameter name for types with one single-letter type parameter.  \n  \n```  \npublic int IComparer<T> { ... }  \npublic delegate bool Predicate<T>(T item);  \npublic struct Nullable<T> where T:struct { ... }  \n```  \n  \n **✓ DO** prefix descriptive type parameter names with `T`.  \n  \n```  \npublic interface ISessionChannel<TSession> where TSession : ISession{  \n    TSession Session { get; }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n **✓ CONSIDER** indicating constraints placed on a type parameter in the name of the parameter.  \n  \n For example, a parameter constrained to `ISession` might be called `TSession`.  \n  \n## Names of Common Types  \n **✓ DO** follow the guidelines described in the following table when naming types derived from or implementing certain .NET Framework types.  \n  \n|Base Type|Derived/Implementing Type Guideline|  \n|---------------|------------------------------------------|  \n|`System.Attribute`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Attribute\" to names of custom attribute classes. add the suffix \"Attribute\" to names of custom attribute classes.|  \n|`System.Delegate`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"EventHandler\" to names of delegates that are used in events.<br /><br /> **✓ DO** add the suffix \"Callback\" to names of delegates other than those used as event handlers.<br /><br /> **X DO NOT** add the suffix \"Delegate\" to a delegate.|  \n|`System.EventArgs`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"EventArgs.\"|  \n|`System.Enum`|**X DO NOT** derive from this class; use the keyword supported by your language instead; for example, in C#, use the enum keyword.<br /><br /> **X DO NOT** add the suffix \"Enum\" or \"Flag.\"|  \n|`System.Exception`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Exception.\"|  \n|`IDictionary` <br /> `IDictionary<TKey,TValue>`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Dictionary.\" Note that `IDictionary` is a specific type of collection, but this guideline takes precedence over the more general collections guideline that follows.|  \n|`IEnumerable` <br /> `ICollection` <br /> `IList` <br /> `IEnumerable<T>` <br /> `ICollection<T>` <br /> `IList<T>`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Collection.\"|  \n|`System.IO.Stream`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Stream.\"|  \n|`CodeAccessPermission IPermission`|**✓ DO** add the suffix \"Permission.\"|  \n  \n## Naming Enumerations  \n Names of enumeration types (also called enums) in general should follow the standard type-naming rules (PascalCasing, etc.). However, there are additional guidelines that apply specifically to enums.  \n  \n **✓ DO** use a singular type name for an enumeration unless its values are bit fields.  \n  \n **✓ DO** use a plural type name for an enumeration with bit fields as values, also called flags enum.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** use an \"Enum\" suffix in enum type names.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** use \"Flag\" or \"Flags\" suffixes in enum type names.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** use a prefix on enumeration value names (e.g., \"ad\" for ADO enums, \"rtf\" for rich text enums, etc.).  \n  \n *Portions © 2005, 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
