This is useful when you have a small amount of data that you want to display in a table format.  \n  \n For a complete explanation of this code example, see [Walkthrough: Creating an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control](walkthrough-creating-an-unbound-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/CS/simpleunbound.cs#00)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound#00](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSimpleUnbound/VB/simpleunbound.vb#00)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing, and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n\n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- [Walkthrough: Creating an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control](walkthrough-creating-an-unbound-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)\n- [Displaying Data in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](displaying-data-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)\n- [Data Display Modes in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](data-display-modes-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,386],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create an Unbound Windows Forms DataGridView Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
