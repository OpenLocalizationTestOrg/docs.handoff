The trust levels for <xref:System.Transactions> are defined based on the types of resources, (for example, system memory, shared process-wide resources, system-wide resources, and other resources), that <xref:System.Transactions> exposes and the level of trust that should be required to access those resources. In a partial-trust environment, a non-full trust assembly can only use transactions within the Application Domain (in this case, the only resource being protected is system memory), unless it is granted the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission> is demanded whenever transaction management is escalated to be managed by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC). This kind of scenario utilizes process-wide resources and particularly a global resource, which is the reserved space in the MSDTC log. An example of this usage is a Web front-end to a database or an application that uses a database as part of the services it provides.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] has its own set of trust levels and associates a specific set of permissions with these trust levels through policy files. For more information, see [ASP.NET Trust Levels and Policy Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/aspnet/wyts434y(v=vs.100)). When you initially install the Windows SDK, none of the default [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] policy files are associated with the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>. As such, when your transaction in an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application is escalated to be managed by the MSDTC, the escalation fails with a <xref:System.Security.SecurityException> upon demanding the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission>. To enable transaction escalation in an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] partial trust environment, you should grant the <xref:System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission> in the same default trust levels as those of <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlClientPermission>. You can either configure your own custom trust level and policy file to support this, or you can modify the default policy files, which are **Web_hightrust.config** and **Web_mediumtrust.config**.  \n  \n To modify the policy files, add a **SecurityClass** element for **DistributedTransactionPermission** to the **SecurityClasses** element under the **PolicyLevel** element and add a corresponding **IPermission** element under the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] **NamedPermissionSet** for System.Transactions. The following configuration file demonstrates this.  \n  \n```xml  \n<SecurityClasses>  \n   <SecurityClass Name=\"DistributedTransactionPermission\" Description=\"System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission, System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\"/>  \n...  \n</SecurityClasses>  \n  \n<PermissionSet  \n  class=\"NamedPermissionSet\"  \n  version=\"1\"  \n  Name=\"ASP.Net\">  \n     <IPermission  \n        class=\"System.Transactions.DistributedTransactionPermission, System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\"  \n        version=\"1\"  \n        Unrestricted=\"true\"  \n     />  \n...  \n</PermissionSet>  \n```  \n  \n For more information about [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] security policy, see [securityPolicy Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/zhs35b56(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n## Dynamic Compilation  \n If you want to import and use <xref:System.Transactions> in an [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] application that is dynamically compiled on access, you should place a reference to the <xref:System.Transactions> assembly in the configuration file. Specifically, the reference should be added under the **compilation**/**assemblies** section of the default root **Web.config** configuration file, or a specific Web application's configuration file. The following example demonstrates this.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>  \n   <system.web>  \n      <compilation>  \n         <assemblies>  \n      <add assembly=\"System.Transactions, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089\" />  \n         </assemblies>  \n      </compilation>  \n   </system.web>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n For more information, see [add Element for assemblies for compilation (ASP.NET Settings Schema)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/37e2zyhb(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ASP.NET
