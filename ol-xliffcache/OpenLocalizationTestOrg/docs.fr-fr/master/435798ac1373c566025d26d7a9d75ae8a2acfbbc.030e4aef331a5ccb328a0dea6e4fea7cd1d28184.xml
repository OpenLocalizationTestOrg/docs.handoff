In most traditional procedural programming languages, a [switch](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=180521) statement selects an execution logic based on the conditional evaluation of a variable. Traditionally, a `switch` statement operates on an expression that can be statically evaluated. For example, in C# this means that only primitive types, such as <xref:System.Boolean>, <xref:System.Int32>, <xref:System.String>, and enumeration types are supported.  \n  \n To enable switching on a custom class, logic must be implemented to evaluate values of the custom complex type at runtime. This sample demonstrates how to enable switching on a custom complex type named `Person`.  \n  \n-   In the custom class `Person`, a <xref:System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter> attribute is declared with the name of the custom <xref:System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter>.  \n  \n    ```  \n    [TypeConverter(typeof(PersonConverter))]  \n    public class Person  \n    {  \n       public string Name { get; set; }  \n       public int Age { get; set; }  \n    ...  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n-   In the custom class `Person`, the <xref:System.Object.Equals%2A> and <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A> classes are overridden.  \n  \n    ```  \n    public override bool Equals(object obj)  \n    {  \n        Person person = obj as Person;  \n  \n        if (person != null)  \n        {  \n            return string.Equals(this.Name, person.Name);  \n        }  \n  \n        return false;  \n    }  \n  \n    public override int GetHashCode()  \n    {  \n        if (this.Name != null)  \n        {  \n            return this.Name.GetHashCode();  \n        }  \n  \n        return 0;  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n-   A custom <xref:System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter> class is implemented that performs the conversion of an instance of the custom class to a string and a string to an instance of a custom class.  \n  \n    ```  \n    public class PersonConverter : TypeConverter  \n    {  \n        public override bool CanConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context,  \n           Type sourceType)  \n        {  \n            return (sourceType is string);  \n        }  \n  \n        // Overrides the ConvertFrom method of TypeConverter.  \n        public override object ConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context,  \n           CultureInfo culture, object value)  \n        {  \n            if (value == null)  \n            {  \n                return null;  \n            }  \n  \n            if (value is string)  \n            {  \n                return new Person  \n                {  \n                    Name = (string)value  \n                };  \n            }  \n  \n            return base.ConvertFrom(context, culture, value);  \n        }  \n  \n        // Overrides the ConvertTo method of TypeConverter.  \n        public override object ConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context,  \n           CultureInfo culture, object value, Type destinationType)  \n        {  \n            if (destinationType == typeof(string))  \n            {  \n                if (value != null)  \n                {  \n                    return ((Person) value).Name;  \n                }  \n                else  \n                {  \n                    return null;  \n                }  \n            }  \n  \n            return base.ConvertTo(context, culture, value, destinationType);  \n        }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n The following files are included in this sample:  \n  \n-   **Person.cs**: Defines the `Person` class.  \n  \n-   **PersonConverter.cs**: The type converter for the `Person` class.  \n  \n-   **Sequence.xaml**: a workflow that switches over the `Person` type.  \n  \n-   **Program.cs**: The main function that runs the workflow.  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.
