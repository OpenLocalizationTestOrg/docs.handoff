The transport that the binding implements determines the actual security mechanism. The topics in this section explain the mechanisms that are implemented and their options.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Transport Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-overview.md)  \n Explains the basics of transport security in WCF.  \n  \n [HTTP Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/http-transport-security.md)  \n Explains how WCF implements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL, or HTTPS).  \n  \n [Understanding HTTP Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-http-authentication.md)  \n Describes HTTP authentication schemes, such as Basic, Digest, NT LAN Manager (NTLM), and others.  \n  \n [Using Impersonation with Transport Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-impersonation-with-transport-security.md)  \n Explains the five levels of impersonation that are possible with transport security mode.  \n  \n [How to: Configure a Port with an SSL Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-port-with-an-ssl-certificate.md)  \n Walks through the basics of configuring a port on a machine with an X.509 certificate for SSL (transport) security.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security>  \n  \n## Related
