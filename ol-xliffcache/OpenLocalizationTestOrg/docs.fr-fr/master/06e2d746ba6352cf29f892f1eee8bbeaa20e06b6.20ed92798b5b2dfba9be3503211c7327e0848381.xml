The control displays a grid containing the numbered days of the month, arranged in columns underneath the days of the week. You can select a different month by clicking the arrow buttons on either side of the month caption. Unlike the similar <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control, you can select a range of dates with this control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker> control allows you to set times as well as dates.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [MonthCalendar Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/monthcalendar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `MonthCalendar` control, which allows users to view and set date information for an application.  \n  \n [How to: Change the Windows Forms MonthCalendar Control's
