You can also use the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.Expand%2A> method on the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> to require that related entities be eagerly loaded in the same query response.  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to explicitly load the `Customer` that is related to each returned `Orders` instance.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#LoadRelatedOrderCustomer](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#loadrelatedordercustomer)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#LoadRelatedOrderCustomer](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#loadrelatedordercustomer)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.Expand%2A> method to return `Order Details` that belong to the `Orders` returned by the query.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#ExpandOrderDetails](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#expandorderdetails)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#ExpandOrderDetails](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#expandorderdetails)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,269],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Load Related Entities (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
