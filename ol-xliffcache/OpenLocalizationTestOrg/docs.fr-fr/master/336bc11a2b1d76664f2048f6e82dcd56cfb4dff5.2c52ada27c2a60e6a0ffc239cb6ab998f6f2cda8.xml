The current task must not be rescheduled until a corresponding call is made to [IHostTaskManager::EndThreadAffinity](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-endthreadaffinity-method.md). Tasks can be switched out, but when they are switched back in, they must be assigned to the same operating system thread from which they were switched out. Nested calls to `BeginThreadAffinity` have no effect, because the call refers to the current task.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ICLRTask Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md)   \n [ICLRTaskManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtaskmanager-interface.md)   \n [IHostTask Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md)   \n [IHostTaskManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,742],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IHostTaskManager::BeginThreadAffinity Method | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
