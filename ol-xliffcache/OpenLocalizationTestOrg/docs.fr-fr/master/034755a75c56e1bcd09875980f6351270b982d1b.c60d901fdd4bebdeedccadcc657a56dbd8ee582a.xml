The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration?displayProperty=fullName> namespace provides classes that enable common interoperation scenarios. The two key classes that implement interoperation capabilities are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>. This topic describes which interoperation scenarios are supported and which scenarios are not supported.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Special consideration is given to the *hybrid control* scenario. A hybrid control has a control from one technology nested in a control from the other technology. This is also called a *nested interoperation*. A *multilevel hybrid control* has more than one level of hybrid control nesting. An example of a multilevel nested interoperation is a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control that contains a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control, which contains another [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control. Multilevel hybrid controls are not supported.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"Windows_Presentation_Foundation_Application_Hosting\"></a>   \n## Hosting Windows Forms Controls in WPF  \n The following interoperation scenarios are supported when a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control hosts a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winforms-md.md)] control:  \n  \n-   The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control may host one or more [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls using XAML.  \n  \n-   It may host one or more [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls using code.  \n  \n-   It may host [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] container controls that contain other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n-   It may host a master/detail form with a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] master and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] details.  \n  \n-   It may host a master/detail form with a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] master and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] details.  \n  \n-   It may host one or more [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-actx-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n-   It may host one or more composite controls.  \n  \n-   It may host hybrid controls using [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)].  \n  \n-   It may host hybrid controls using code.  \n  \n### Layout Support  \n The following list describes the known limitations when the  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> element attempts to integrate its hosted [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control into the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] layout system.  \n  \n-   In some cases, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls cannot be resized, or can be sized only to specific dimensions. For example, a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> control supports only a single height, which is defined by the control's font size. In a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] dynamic layout, which assumes that elements can stretch vertically, a hosted <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> control will not stretch as expected.  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls cannot be rotated or skewed. For example, when you rotate your user interface by 90 degrees, hosted [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls will maintain their upright position.  \n  \n-   In most cases, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls do not support proportional scaling. Although the overall dimensions of the control will scale, child controls and component elements of the control may not resize as expected. This limitation depends on how well each [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control supports scaling.  \n  \n-   In a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] user interface, you can change the z-order of elements to control overlapping behavior. A hosted [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control is drawn in a separate HWND, so it is always drawn on top of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] elements.  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls support autoscaling based on the font size. In a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] user interface, changing the font size does not resize the entire layout, although individual elements may dynamically resize.  \n  \n### Ambient Properties  \n Some of the ambient properties of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls have [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] equivalents. These ambient properties are propagated to the hosted [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls and exposed as public properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control translates each [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] ambient property into its [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] equivalent.  \n  \n For more information, see [Windows Forms and WPF Property Mapping](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/windows-forms-and-wpf-property-mapping.md).  \n  \n### Behavior  \n The following table describes interoperation behavior.  \n  \n|Behavior|Supported|Not supported|  \n|--------------|---------------|-------------------|  \n|Transparency|[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control rendering supports transparency.

For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ComboBox> controls will not be transparent when hosted by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].|  \n|Tabbing|Tab order for hosted [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls is the same as when those controls are hosted in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]-based application.<br /><br /> Tabbing from a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control to a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control with the TAB key and SHIFT+TAB keys works as usual.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls that have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabStop%2A> property value of `false` do not receive focus when the user tabs through controls.<br /><br /> -   Each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control has a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost.TabIndex%2A> value, which determines when that <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control will receive focus.<br />-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls that are contained inside a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> container follow the order specified by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.TabIndex%2A> property. Tabbing from the last tab index puts focus on the next [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control, if one exists. If no other focusable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control exists, tabbing returns to the first [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control in the tab order.<br />-   <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost.TabIndex%2A> values for controls inside the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> are relative to sibling [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls that are contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control.<br />-   Tabbing honors control-specific behavior. For example, pressing the TAB key in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control that has a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBoxBase.AcceptsTab%2A> property value of `true` enters a tab in the text box instead of moving the focus.|Not applicable.|  \n|Navigation with arrow keys|-   Navigation with arrow keys in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control is the same as in an ordinary [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] container control: The UP ARROW and LEFT ARROW keys select the previous control, and the DOWN ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys select the next control.<br />-   The UP ARROW and LEFT ARROW keys from the first control that is contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control perform the same action as the SHIFT+TAB keyboard shortcut. If there is a focusable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control, focus moves outside the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control. This behavior differs from the standard <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl> behavior in that no wrapping to the last control occurs. If no other focusable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control exists, focus returns to the last [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control in the tab order.<br />-   The DOWN ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys from the last control that is contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control perform the same action as the TAB key. If there is a focusable [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control, focus moves outside the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control.

When an accelerator is duplicated across technologies, with at least one on a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control and the other on a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control always receives the accelerator. Focus does not toggle between the controls when the duplicate accelerator is pressed.|  \n|Shortcut keys|Shortcut keys work as usual, except where noted in the \"Not supported\" column.|-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] shortcut keys that are handled at the preprocessing stage always take precedence over [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] shortcut keys. For example, if you have a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control with CTRL+S shortcut keys defined, and there is a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] command bound to CTRL+S, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control handler is always invoked first, regardless of focus.<br />-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] shortcut keys that are handled by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event are processed last in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. You can prevent this behavior by overriding the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey%2A> method or handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PreviewKeyDown> event. Return `true` from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey%2A> method, or set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PreviewKeyDownEventArgs.IsInputKey%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to `true` in your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PreviewKeyDown> event handler.|  \n|AcceptsReturn, AcceptsTab, and other control-specific behavior|Properties that change the default keyboard behavior work as usual, assuming that the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputKey%2A> method to return `true`.|[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls that change default keyboard behavior by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown> event are processed last in the host [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control.
