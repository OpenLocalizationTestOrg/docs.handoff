When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n `Leave` allows the CLR to communicate directly with the host's threading implementation, rather than using the corresponding Win32 `LeaveCriticalSection` function. A thread that takes ownership of the critical section represented by the current `IHostCrst` instance must call `Leave` once for each time it enters that critical section.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n
