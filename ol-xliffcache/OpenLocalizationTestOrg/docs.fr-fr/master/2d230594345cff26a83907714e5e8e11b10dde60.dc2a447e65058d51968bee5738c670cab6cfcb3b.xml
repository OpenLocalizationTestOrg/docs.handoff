If you do not have the Northwind sample database on your development computer, you can download it from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=98088) Web site. For instructions, see [Downloading Sample Databases](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb399411).  \n  \n### To create a connection to a database  \n  \n1.  In Visual Studio, open **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer** by clicking the **View** menu, and then select **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer**.  \n  \n2.  Right-click **Data Connections** in **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer**, and click **Add Connection**.  \n  \n3.  Specify a valid connection to the Northwind sample database.  \n  \n### To add a Project with a LINQ to SQL file  \n  \n1.  In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **New** and then click **Project**. Select Visual Basic **Windows Forms Application** as the project type.  \n  \n2.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add New Item**. Select the **LINQ to SQL Classes** item template.  \n  \n3.  Name the file `northwind.dbml`. Click **Add**. The Object Relational Designer (O/R Designer) is opened for the `northwind.dbml` file.  \n  \n### To add tables to query and modify to the designer  \n  \n1.  In **Server Explorer**/**Database Explorer**, expand the connection to the Northwind database. Expand the **Tables** folder.  \n  \n     If you have closed the O/R Designer, you can reopen it by double-clicking the `northwind.dbml` file that you added earlier.  \n  \n2.  Click the Customers table and drag it to the left pane of the designer.  \n  \n     The designer creates a new Customer object for your project.  \n  \n3.  Save your changes and close the designer.  \n  \n4.  Save your project.  \n  \n### To add code to modify the database and display the results  \n  \n1.  From the **Toolbox**, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control onto the default Windows Form for your project, Form1.  \n  \n2.  When you added tables to the O/R Designer, the designer added a <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object to your project. This object contains code that you can use to access the Customers table. It also contains code that defines  a local Customer object and a Customers collection for the table. The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object for your project is named based on the name of your .dbml file. For this project, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object is named `northwindDataContext`.  \n  \n     You can create an instance of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object in your code and query and modify the Customers collection specified by the O/R Designer. Changes that you make to the Customers collection are not reflected in the database until you submit them by calling the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> method of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> object.  \n  \n     Double-click the Windows Form, Form1, to add code to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event to query the Customers table that is exposed as a property of your <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>. Add the following code:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private db As northwindDataContext  \n  \n    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object,   \n                           ByVal e As System.EventArgs  \n                          ) Handles MyBase.Load  \n      db = New northwindDataContext()  \n  \n      RefreshData()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Private Sub RefreshData()  \n      Dim customers = From cust In db.Customers   \n                      Where cust.City(0) = \"W\"   \n                      Select cust  \n  \n      DataGridView1.DataSource = customers  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  From the **Toolbox**, drag three <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> controls onto the form. Select the first `Button` control. In the **Properties** window, set the `Name` of the `Button` control to `AddButton` and the `Text` to `Add`. Select the second button and set the `Name` property to `UpdateButton` and the `Text` property to `Update`. Select the third button and set the `Name` property to `DeleteButton` and the `Text` property to `Delete`.  \n  \n4.  Double-click the **Add** button to add code to its `Click` event. Add the following code:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub AddButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object,   \n                                ByVal e As System.EventArgs  \n                               ) Handles AddButton.Click  \n      Dim cust As New Customer With {   \n        .City = \"Wellington\",   \n        .CompanyName = \"Blue Yonder Airlines\",   \n        .ContactName = \"Jill Frank\",   \n        .Country = \"New Zealand\",   \n        .CustomerID = \"JILLF\"}  \n  \n      db.Customers.InsertOnSubmit(cust)  \n  \n      Try  \n        db.SubmitChanges()  \n      Catch  \n        ' Handle exception.  \n      End Try  \n  \n      RefreshData()  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Double-click the **Update** button to add code to its `Click` event. Add the following code:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub UpdateButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n                                   ByVal e As System.EventArgs  \n                                  ) Handles UpdateButton.Click  \n      Dim updateCust = (From cust In db.Customers   \n                        Where cust.CustomerID = \"JILLF\").ToList()(0)  \n  \n      updateCust.ContactName = \"Jill Shrader\"  \n  \n      Try  \n        db.SubmitChanges()  \n      Catch  \n        ' Handle exception.  \n      End Try  \n  \n      RefreshData()  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Double-click the **Delete** button to add code to its `Click` event. Add the following code:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub DeleteButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n                                   ByVal e As System.EventArgs  \n                                  ) Handles DeleteButton.Click  \n      Dim deleteCust = (From cust In db.Customers   \n                        Where cust.CustomerID = \"JILLF\").ToList()(0)  \n  \n      db.Customers.DeleteOnSubmit(deleteCust)  \n  \n      Try  \n        db.SubmitChanges()  \n      Catch  \n        ' Handle exception.  \n      End Try  \n  \n      RefreshData()  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  Press F5 to run your project. Click **Add** to add a new record. Click **Update** to modify the new record. Click **Delete** to delete the new record.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [LINQ](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)   \n
