The string passed as `pwszVersion` must start with the character \"v\" followed by the first three parts of the version number (for example, \"v1.0.1529\").  \n  \n Some versions of the CLR are installed with a policy statement that specifies compatibility with previous versions of the CLR. By default, the startup shim evaluates `pwszVersion` against policy statements and loads the latest version of the runtime that is compatible with the version being requested. A host can force the shim to skip policy evaluation and load the exact version specified in `pwszVersion` by passing a value of STARTUP_LOADER_SAFEMODE for the `startupFlags` parameter.  \n  \n If `pwszVersion` is `null,` the method does not load any version of the CLR. Instead, it returns CLR_E_SHIM_RUNTIMELOAD, which indicates that it failed to load the runtime.  \n  \n `pwszBuildFlavor`  \n [in] A string that specifies whether to load the server or the workstation build of the CLR. Valid values are `svr` and `wks`. The server build is optimized to take advantage of multiple processors for garbage collections, and the workstation build is optimized for client applications running on a single-processor machine.  \n  \n If `pwszBuildFlavor`is set to null, the workstation build is loaded. When running on a single-processor machine, the workstation build is always loaded, even if `pwszBuildFlavor`is set to `svr`. However, if `pwszBuildFlavor`is set to `svr` and concurrent garbage collection is specified (see the description of the `startupFlags` parameter), the server build is loaded.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Concurrent garbage collection is not supported in applications running the WOW64 x86 emulator on 64-bit systems that implement the Intel Itanium architecture (formerly called IA-64). For more information about using WOW64 on 64-bit Windows systems, see [Running 32-bit Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa384249.aspx).  \n  \n `pwszHostConfigFile`  \n [in] The name of a host configuration file that specifies the version of the CLR to load. If the file name does not include a fully qualified path, the file is assumed to be in the same directory as the executable that is making the call.  \n  \n `pReserved`  \n [in] Reserved for future extensibility.  \n  \n `startupFlags`  \n [in] A set of flags that controls concurrent garbage collection, domain-neutral code, and the behavior of the `pwszVersion` parameter. The default is single domain if no flag is set. For a list of supported values, see the [STARTUP_FLAGS enumeration](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/startup-flags-enumeration.md).  \n  \n `rclsid`  \n [in] The `CLSID` of the coclass that implements either the [ICorRuntimeHost](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/icorruntimehost-interface.md) or the [ICLRRuntimeHost](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-interface.md) interface. Supported values are CLSID_CorRuntimeHost or CLSID_CLRRuntimeHost.  \n  \n `riid`  \n [in] The `IID` of the interface you are requesting. Supported values are IID_ICorRuntimeHost or IID_ICLRRuntimeHost.  \n  \n `ppv`  \n [out] An interface pointer to the version of the runtime that was loaded.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:**
