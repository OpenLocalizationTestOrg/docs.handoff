If the first operand evaluates to `true`, the second operand isn't evaluated. If the first operand evaluates to `false`, the second operator determines whether the OR expression as a whole evaluates to `true` or `false`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The operation  \n  \n```  \nx || y  \n```  \n  \n corresponds to the operation  \n  \n```  \nx | y  \n```  \n  \n except that if `x` is `true`, `y` is not evaluated because the OR operation is `true` regardless of the value of `y`. This concept is known as \"short-circuit\" evaluation.  \n  \n The conditional-OR operator cannot be overloaded, but overloads of the regular logical operators and the [true](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/true.md) and [false](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/false.md) operators are, with certain restrictions, also considered to be overloads of the conditional logical operators.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following examples, the expression that uses `||` evaluates only the first operand. The expression that uses `|` evaluates both operands. In the second example, a run-time exception occurs if both operands are evaluated.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csRefOperators#52](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/conditional-or-operator_1.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Operators](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,624],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"|| Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
