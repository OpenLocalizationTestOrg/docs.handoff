[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides three line join styles: miter, bevel, and round. Line join style is a property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. When you specify a line join style for a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object, that join style will be applied to all the connected lines in any <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object drawn using that pen.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the results of the beveled line join example.  \n  \n ![Pens](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/pens5.gif \"pens5\")  \n  \n## Example  \n You can specify the line join style by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> class. The example demonstrates a beveled line join between a horizontal line and a vertical line. In the following code, the value <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> assigned to the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property is a member of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration. The other members of the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration are <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin>.  \n  \n
