This method must have a signature that matches what is expected by the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextChangedEventHandler> delegate.  \n  \n The event handler is called whenever the contents of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control are changed, either by a user or programmatically.  \n  \n **Note:** This event fires when the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control is created and initially populated with text.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] that defines your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control, specify the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> attribute with a value that matches the event handler method name.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextBox_MiscCode#_TextChangedXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextBox_MiscCode/CSharp/Window1.xaml#_textchangedxaml)]  \n  \n## Example  \n In the code-behind class for the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] that contains the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> control that you want to monitor for changes, insert a method to call whenever the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.TextBoxBase.TextChanged> event fires.
