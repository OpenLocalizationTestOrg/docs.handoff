Lines of code preceded by an identifying string or integer are said to be *labeled*. Statement labels are used to mark a line of code to identify it for use with statements such as `On Error Goto`.  \n  \n Labels may be either valid Visual Basic identifiers—such as those that identify programming elements—or integer literals. A label must appear at the beginning of a line of source code and must be followed by a colon, regardless of whether it is followed by a statement on the same line.  \n  \n The compiler identifies labels by checking whether the beginning of the line matches any already-defined identifier. If it does not, the compiler assumes it is a label.  \n  \n Labels have their own declaration space and do not interfere with other identifiers. A label's scope is the body of the method. Label declaration takes precedence in any ambiguous situation.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Labels can be used only on executable statements inside methods.  \n  \n### To label a line of code  \n  \n-   Place an identifier, followed by a colon, at the beginning of the line of source code.  \n  \n     For example, the following lines of code are labeled with `Jump` and `120`, respectively:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrStatements#708](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/error-messages/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-label-statements_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Statements](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/statements.md)   \n [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md)   \n [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/program-structure-and-code-conventions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,686],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Label Statements (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"How to: Label Statements (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Label Statements (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]}],"pos":[6,65],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Label Statements (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
