The `Log` object is configured by the application's configuration file.  \n  \n The `My.Log` object is available only for ASP.NET applications. For client applications, use `My.Application.Log`. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.Log>.  \n  \n## Tasks  \n  \n|To|See|  \n|--------|---------|  \n|Write event information to the application's logs.|[How to: Write Log
