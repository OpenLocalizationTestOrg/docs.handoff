The output will contain the following:\n\n* Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a `*.dll` extension.\n* *\\*.deps.json* file that contains all of the dependencies of the project.\n* *\\*.runtime.config.json* file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).\n* The application's dependencies. These are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.\n\nThe `dotnet publish` command's output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac, laptop) for execution and is the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment. Depending on the type of deployment that the project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET Core shared runtime installed on it. For more information, see [.NET Core Application Deployment](../deploying/index.md). For the directory structure of a published application, see [Directory structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/hosting/directory-structure).\n\n## Arguments\n\n`PROJECT` \n\nThe project to publish, which defaults to the current directory if not specified. \n\n## Options\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.  \n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nPublishes the application for the specified [target framework](../../standard/frameworks.md). You must specify the target framework in the project file.\n\n`-r|--runtime <RUNTIME_IDENTIFIER>`\n\nPublishes the application for a given runtime. This is used when creating a [self-contained deployment (SCD)](../deploying/index.md#self-contained-deployments-scd). For a list of Runtime Identifiers (RIDs), see the [RID catalog](../rid-catalog.md). Default is to publish a [framework-dependent deployment (FDD)](../deploying/index.md#framework-dependent-deployments-fdd).\n\n`-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the path for the output directory. If not specified, it defaults to *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/* for a framework-dependent deployment or *./bin/[configuration]/[framework]/[runtime]* for a self-contained deployment.\n\n`-c|--configuration <CONFIGURATION>`\n\nConfiguration to use when building the project. The default value is `Debug`.\n\n`--version-suffix <VERSION_SUFFIX>`\n\nDefines the version suffix to replace the asterisk (`*`) in the version field of the project file.\n\n`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed values are `q[uiet]`, `m[inimal]`, `n[ormal]`, `d[etailed]`, and `diag[nostic]`.\n\n## Examples\n\nPublish the project in the current directory:\n\n`dotnet publish`\n\nPublish the application using the specified project file:\n\n`dotnet publish ~/projects/app1/app1.csproj`\n    \nPublish the project in the current directory using the `netcoreapp1.1` framework:\n\n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1`\n    \nPublish the current application using the `netcoreapp1.1` framework and the runtime for `OS X 10.10` (you must list this RID in the project file).\n\n`dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1 --runtime osx.10.11-x64`\n\n## See also\n\n* [Target frameworks](../../standard/frameworks.md)\n* [Runtime IDentifier (RID)
