When an event is raised, the event handler or handlers that receive the event are executed. Events can be assigned to multiple handlers, and the methods that handle particular events can be changed dynamically. You can also use the Windows Forms Designer to create event handlers.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Events Overview](events-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains the event model and the role of delegates.  \n  \n [Event Handlers Overview](event-handlers-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes how to handle events.  \n  \n [How to: Create Event Handlers at Run Time for Windows Forms](how-to-create-event-handlers-at-run-time-for-windows-forms.md)  \n Gives directions for responding to system or user events dynamically.  \n  \n [How to: Connect Multiple Events to a Single Event Handler in Windows Forms](how-to-connect-multiple-events-to-a-single-event-handler-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Gives directions for assigning the same functionality to multiple controls through events.  \n  \n [Order of Events in Windows Forms](order-of-events-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes the order in which events are raised in Windows Forms controls.  \n  \n [How to: Create Event Handlers Using the Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/zwwsdtbk(v=vs.100))  \n Describes how to use the Windows Forms Designer to create event handlers.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Events](../../standard/events/index.md)  \n Provides links to topics on handling and raising events using the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)].  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Inherited Event Handlers in Visual Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/troubleshooting-inherited-event-handlers.md)  \n Lists common issues that occur with event handlers in inherited components.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,346],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
