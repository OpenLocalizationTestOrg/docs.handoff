The list is designed to support the topic [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md). It also can be used for any application that requires a list of objects. The code defines the items in the list of students by using object initializers.  \n  \n## Example  \n If you are working on the walkthrough, you can use this code for the Module1.vb file of the project that is created there. Just replace the lines marked with **** in the `Main` method with the queries and query executions that are provided in the walkthrough.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbLINQHowToCreateList#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbLINQHowToCreateList/VB/Class1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)\n- [Getting Started with LINQ in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq.md)\n- [Object Initializers: Named and Anonymous Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/object-initializers-named-and-anonymous-types.md)\n- [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)\n- [LINQ](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)\n- [Queries](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,212],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a List of Items\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
