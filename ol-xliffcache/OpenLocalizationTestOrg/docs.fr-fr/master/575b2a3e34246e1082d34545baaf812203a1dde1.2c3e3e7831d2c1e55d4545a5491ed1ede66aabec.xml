A service can be hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS), Windows Process Activation Service (WAS), Windows Server AppFabric, a Windows service, or by a managed application—this option is often referred to as *self hosting*.  \n  \n It is important to note that running a service or any extension from an untrusted host compromises security.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Hosting in Internet Information Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-internet-information-services.md)  \n Describes how a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service is hosted in Internet Information Services or [Windows Server AppFabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=196496).  \n  \n [Hosting in Windows Process Activation Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-windows-process-activation-service.md)  \n Describes how a WCF service is hosted by Windows Process Activation Service.  \n  \n [Hosting in a Windows Service Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-a-windows-service-application.md)  \n Describes how a WCF service is hosted by a Windows service.  \n  \n [Hosting in a Managed Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-a-managed-application.md)  \n Describes how a WCF service is hosted in a managed application.  \n  \n [Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/configuration-based-activation-in-iis-and-was.md)  \n Describes how a WCF service is hosted under IIS or WAS without using a .svc file.  \n  \n [Supporting Multiple IIS Site Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/supporting-multiple-iis-site-bindings.md)  \n Describes how to specify multiple base addresses for a service using the same URI scheme on a single Web site.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)\n- [Windows Server
