When a user clicks the button that the handler is attached to, the handler changes a property value. The handler code uses the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> property of the routed event data that is reported in the event arguments to change the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> property value on the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> element.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[RoutedEventSource#XAMLHandler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventSource/CSharp/default.xaml#xamlhandler)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RoutedEventSource#Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventSource/CSharp/default.xaml.cs#handler)]\n [!code-vb[RoutedEventSource#Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RoutedEventSource/VisualBasic/default.xaml.vb#handler)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs>\n- [Routed Events Overview](routed-events-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](events-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,290],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"source element in event handlers [WPF]\"\n  - \"event handlers [WPF], finding source element in\"\nms.assetid: 85f71c5a-b714-4c65-9711-7d905c2bbe98","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","nodes":[{"pos":[0,51],"content":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","pos":[0,51]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[297,348],"content":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","linkify":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Find the Source Element in an Event Handler","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to find the source element in an event handler.","pos":[349,419]},{"pos":[428,435],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click&gt;</ph> event handler that is declared in a code-behind file.","pos":[439,581],"source":"The following example shows a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event handler that is declared in a code-behind file."},{"content":"When a user clicks the button that the handler is attached to, the handler changes a property value.","pos":[582,682]},{"content":"The handler code uses the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A&gt;</ph> property of the routed event data that is reported in the event arguments to change the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A&gt;</ph> property value on the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[683,971],"source":" The handler code uses the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> property of the routed event data that is reported in the event arguments to change the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> property value on the <xref:System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs.Source%2A> element."},{"pos":[1404,1412],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1456,1507],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Routed Events Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](routed-events-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Routed Events Overview](routed-events-overview.md)"},{"pos":[1510,1550],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](events-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[How-to Topics](events-how-to-topics.md)"}]}
