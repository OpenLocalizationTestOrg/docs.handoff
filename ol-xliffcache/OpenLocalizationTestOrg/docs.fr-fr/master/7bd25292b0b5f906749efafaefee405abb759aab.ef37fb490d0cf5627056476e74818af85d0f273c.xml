After a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `ModifyApplicationPolicy` method can be called twice. The first call should supply a null value for the `pbNewApplicationPolicy` parameter. This call will return with the necessary value for `pcbNewAppPolicySize`. The second call should supply this value for `pcbNewAppPolicySize`, and point to a buffer of that size for `pbNewApplicationPolicy`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
