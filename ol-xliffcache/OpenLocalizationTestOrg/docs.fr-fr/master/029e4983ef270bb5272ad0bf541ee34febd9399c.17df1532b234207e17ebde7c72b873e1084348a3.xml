With this tool you can create, edit, and sign deployment and application manifests. New manifests that are created with MageUI.exe target the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v40_long](../../../includes/net-client-v40-long-md.md)]. Previous versions of MageUI.exe should be used to target previous .NET Framework versions. When adding or removing assemblies from a manifest, or re-signing existing manifests, MageUI.exe does not update the manifest to target [!INCLUDE[net_client_v40_long](../../../includes/net-client-v40-long-md.md)]. For more information, see [Mage.exe (Manifest Generation and Editing Tool)](../../../docs/framework/tools/mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).\n\n This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. To run the tool, use the Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio (or the Visual Studio Command Prompt in Windows 7). For more information, see [Command Prompts](../../../docs/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs.md).\n\n Two versions of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe are included as a component of Visual Studio. To see version information, run MageUI.exe, select **Help**, and select **About**. This documentation describes version 4.0.x.x of Mage.exe and MageUI.exe.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> MageUI.exe does not support the [compatibleFrameworks](/visualstudio/deployment/compatibleframeworks-element-clickonce-deployment) element when saving an application manifest that has already been signed with a certificate using MageUI.exe. Instead, you must use [Mage.exe](../../../docs/framework/tools/mage-exe-manifest-generation-and-editing-tool.md).  \n  \n## UIElement List  \n The following table lists the menu and toolbar items that are available.  \n  \n|Command|Menu|Shortcut|Description|  \n|-------------|----------|--------------|-----------------|  \n|**Application Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new application manifest.|  \n|**Deployment Manifest**|**File, New**||Creates a new deployment manifest.|  \n|**Open**|**File**|CTRL+O|Opens an existing deployment manifest, application manifest, or trust license for editing.|  \n|**Close**|**File**|CTRL+F4|Closes an open file.<br /><br /> If you modify a file before closing it, MageUI.exe prompts you to re-sign the file with a public key, key pair, or stored certificate.|  \n|**Save**|**File**|CTRL+S|Saves to disk the document which currently has user input focus.|  \n|**Save As**|**File**||Saves a file to disk, enabling you to supply a new file name and/or location.|  \n|**Save All**|**File**||Saves the changes made to all files currently open within MageUI.exe.|  \n|**Preferences**|**File**||Opens the **Preferences** dialog box. See the following section for more information.|  \n|**Exit**|**File**|ALT+F4|Quits MageUI.exe.|  \n|**Cut**|**Edit**|CTRL+X|Removes the currently selected text from the application and moves it to the system Clipboard.|  \n|**Copy**|**Edit**|CTRL+C|Copies the currently selected text to the system Clipboard.|  \n|**Paste**|**Edit**|CTRL+V|Pastes text from the system Clipboard into the currently active text element.|  \n|**Delete**|**Edit**||Deletes an element currently selected in a list, such as a trust license on the **Deployment Manifest** tab.|  \n|**Close All**|**Window**||Closes all files currently open in MageUI.exe. If one or more files need saving, MageUI.exe prompts you to save them. MageUI.exe also prompts you to select a signing key for each unsigned or changed file.|  \n|**About**|**Help**||Displays version and copyright information about MageUI.exe.|  \n  \n## Preferences Dialog Box  \n The **Preferences** dialog box contains the following elements.  \n  \n|UI Element|Description|  \n|----------------|-----------------|  \n|**Sign on save**|Prompts you to sign a file whenever you save your modifications.|  \n|**Use default signing certificate**|Uses the key entered in the **Certificate file** text box to sign all files. This eliminates the signing prompt that typically appears when you save a file and **Sign on Save** is selected. Use the ellipsis (**…**) button next to the **Certificate file** text box to select a key file.|  \n|Digest algorithm|Specifies the algorithm to generate dependency digests with. Value must be \"sha256RSA\" or \"sha1RSA\". Uses SHA1 as the default. Used both in application and deployment manifests. If the user provides a certificate when saving the manifest, uses the algorithms in the certificate to generate dependency digests with.|  \n  \n## Signing Options Dialog Box  \n The **Signing Options** dialog box appears when you save a manifest or trust license for the first time, or when you change a manifest or trust license. It only appears if the **Sign on Save** option in the **Preferences** dialog box is selected. You must be connected to the Internet when signing a manifest that specifies a value in the **TimeStamping URI** text box.  \n  \n This dialog box contains the following elements.  \n  \n|UI Element|Description|  \n|----------------|-----------------|  \n|**Sign with certificate file**|Signs the manifest with a digital certificate stored on the file system.|  \n|**File**|Provides an area to type the path to the .pfx file representing the certificate.|  \n|**...**|Opens a **Choose File** dialog box for selecting an existing .pfx file.|  \n|**New**|Generates a new .pfx that is not verifiable through a Certificate Authority (CA).

If not applicable, can be left blank.|  \n|**Sign with stored certificate**|Displays a selectable list of digital certificates stored in your computer's certificate store.|  \n|**TimeStamping URI**|Displays the Uniform Resource Locator (URI) of a digital timestamping service. Timestamping the manifests prevents you from having to re-sign the manifests if your digital certificate expires before you deploy the next version of your application. For more information, see [Windows root certificate program members](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=159000) and [ClickOnce and Authenticode](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-and-authenticode).|  \n|**Don't Sign**|Allows you to save the manifest without adding a signature from a digital certificate.|  \n  \n## Tab and Panel Descriptions  \n When you open a document with MageUI.exe, it appears within its own tab page.
