For example, in the following code, the call from `Main` to `PublicMethod` fails because the return type, `PrivateType`, is declared with the `Private` access modifier in class `TestClass`. Therefore, the context within which `PrivateType` can be accessed is limited to `TestClass`.  \n  \n```vb  \nClass TestClass  \n  \n    Dim pT As New PrivateType  \n  \n    Private Class PrivateType  \n    End Class  \n  \n    '' A corresponding error is returned in this line: 'PublicMethod   \n    '' cannot expose 'PrivateType' in namespace 'ConsoleApplication1'   \n    '' through class 'TestClass'.  \n    'Public Function PublicMethod() As PrivateType  \n    '    Return Nothing  \n    'End Function  \n  \nEnd Class  \n  \nModule Module1  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n  \n        Dim tc As TestClass  \n        '' This error occurs here, because the data type returned by   \n        '' PublicMethod()is declared Private in class TestClass and   \n        '' cannot be accessed from here.  \n        'Console.WriteLine(tc.PublicMethod())  \n  \n    End Sub  \n  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36665 and BC36666  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the type definition is accessible, change the access modifier from `Private` to `Public`.  \n  \n-   Change the return type of the function if you have access to it.  \n  \n-   Write a method or extension method that returns an accessible type.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Access Levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,133],"content":"&#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>methodname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,121],"source":"&#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[692,796],"content":"&#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible","linkify":"&#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;<ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;lt;</ph>methodname<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph>&amp;#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible","pos":[0,104],"source":"&#39;&lt;methodname&gt;&#39; is not accessible in this context because the return type is not accessible"}]},{"content":"You have called a function that has a return type that you cannot access from the calling statement.","pos":[797,897]},{"content":"For example, in the following code, the call from <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph2\">`PublicMethod`</ph> fails because the return type, <ph id=\"ph3\">`PrivateType`</ph>, is declared with the <ph id=\"ph4\">`Private`</ph> access modifier in class <ph id=\"ph5\">`TestClass`</ph>.","pos":[898,1087],"source":" For example, in the following code, the call from `Main` to `PublicMethod` fails because the return type, `PrivateType`, is declared with the `Private` access modifier in class `TestClass`."},{"content":"Therefore, the context within which <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrivateType`</ph> can be accessed is limited to <ph id=\"ph2\">`TestClass`</ph>.","pos":[1088,1180],"source":" Therefore, the context within which `PrivateType` can be accessed is limited to `TestClass`."},{"pos":[1946,1979],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36665 and BC36666","source":"**Error ID:** BC36665 and BC36666"},{"pos":[1988,2009],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[2019,2111],"content":"If the type definition is accessible, change the access modifier from <ph id=\"ph1\">`Private`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph2\">`Public`</ph>.","source":"If the type definition is accessible, change the access modifier from `Private` to `Public`."},{"content":"Change the return type of the function if you have access to it.","pos":[2121,2185]},{"content":"Write a method or extension method that returns an accessible type.","pos":[2195,2262]},{"pos":[2271,2279],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2283,2405],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Access Levels in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)</ept>","source":"[Access Levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)"}]}
