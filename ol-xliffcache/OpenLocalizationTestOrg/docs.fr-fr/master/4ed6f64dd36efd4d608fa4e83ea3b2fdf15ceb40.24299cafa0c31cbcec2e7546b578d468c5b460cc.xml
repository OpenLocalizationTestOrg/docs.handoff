[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] offers special support for configuring, identifying, and using these types of data files, which are called application data files. This support revolves around a specific set of application data file types, including:  \n  \n-   **Resource Files**: Data files that are compiled into either an executable or library                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] assembly.  \n  \n-   **Content Files**: Standalone data files that have an explicit association with an executable                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] assembly.  \n  \n-   **Site of Origin Files**: Standalone data files that have no association with an executable                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] assembly.  \n  \n One important distinction to make between these three types of files is that resource files and content files are known at build time; an assembly has explicit knowledge of them. For site of origin files, however, an assembly may have no knowledge of them at all, or implicit knowledge through a pack              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] reference; the case of the latter, there is no guarantee that the referenced site of origin file actually exists.  \n  \n To reference application data files,              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wpf-md.md)] uses the Pack              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] Scheme, which is described in detail in              [Pack URIs in WPF](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/pack-uris-in-wpf.md)).  \n  \n This topic describes how to configure and use application data files.  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"Resource_Files\"></a>   \n## Resource Files  \n If an application data file must always be available to an application, the only way to guarantee availability is to compile it into an application's main executable assembly or one of its referenced assemblies. This type of application data file is known as a                  *resource file*.  \n  \n You should use resource files when:  \n  \n-   You don't need to update the resource file's content after it is compiled into an assembly.  \n  \n-   You want to simplify application distribution complexity by reducing the number of file dependencies.  \n  \n-   Your application data file needs to be localizable (see                          [WPF Globalization and Localization Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-globalization-and-localization-overview.md)).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The                      resource files described in this section are different than the resource files described in                      [XAML Resources](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/xaml-resources.md) and different than the embedded or linked resources described in                      [Managing Application Resources (.NET)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f2582734-8ada-4baa-8a7c-e2ef943ddf7e).  \n  \n### Configuring Resource Files  \n In                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], a resource file is a file that is included in an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] project as a                          `Resource` item.  \n  \n```  \n<Project \"  \n                        xmlns=http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" ... >  \n  ...  \n  <ItemGroup>  \n    <Resource Include=\"ResourceFile.xaml\" />  \n  </ItemGroup>  \n  ...  \n</Project>  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In                              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)], you create a resource file by adding a file to a project and setting its                              `Build Action` to                              `Resource`.  \n  \n When the project is built,                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] compiles the resource into the assembly.  \n  \n### Using Resource Files  \n To load a resource file, you can call the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetResourceStream%2A> method of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class, passing a pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that identifies the desired resource file.                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetResourceStream%2A> returns a                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.StreamResourceInfo> object, which exposes the resource file as a                          <xref:System.IO.Stream> and describes its content type.  \n  \n As an example, the following code shows how to use                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetResourceStream%2A> to load a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> resource file and set it as the content of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> (                         `pageFrame`):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageResourceFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/CSharp/ResourcesSample/ApplicationGetResourceStreamSnippetWindow.xaml.cs#loadapageresourcefilemanuallycode)]\n [!code-vb[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageResourceFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/VisualBasic/ResourcesSample/ApplicationGetResourceStreamSnippetWindow.xaml.vb#loadapageresourcefilemanuallycode)]  \n  \n While calling                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetResourceStream%2A> gives you access to the                          <xref:System.IO.Stream>, you need to perform the additional work of converting it to the type of the property that you'll be setting it with.

Although they are not compiled into an assembly, assemblies are compiled with metadata that establishes an association with each content file.  \n  \n You should use content files when your application requires a specific set of application data files that you want to be able to update without recompiling the assembly that consumes them.  \n  \n### Configuring Content Files  \n To add a content file to a project, an application data file must be included as a                          `Content` item. Furthermore, because a content file is not compiled directly into the assembly, you need to set the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`CopyToOutputDirectory` metadata element to specify that the content file is copied to a location that is relative to the built assembly. If you want the resource to be copied to the build output folder every time a project is built, you set the                          `CopyToOutputDirectory` metadata element with the                          `Always` value. Otherwise, you can ensure that only the newest version of the resource is copied to the build output folder by using the                          `PreserveNewest` value.  \n  \n The following shows a file that is configured as a content file which is copied to the build output folder only when a new version of the resource is added to the project.  \n  \n```  \n<Project  \n                        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" ... >  \n  ...  \n  <ItemGroup>  \n    <Content Include=\"ContentFile.xaml\">  \n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>  \n    </Content>  \n  </ItemGroup>  \n  ...  \n</Project>  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)], you create a content file by adding a file to a project and setting its                              `Build Action` to                              `Content`, and set its                              `Copy to Output Directory` to                              `Copy always` (same as                              `Always`) and                              `Copy if newer` (same as                              `PreserveNewest`).  \n  \n When the project is built, an                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.AssemblyAssociatedContentFileAttribute> attribute is compiled into the metadata of the assembly for each content file.  \n  \n `[assembly: AssemblyAssociatedContentFile(\"ContentFile.xaml\")]`  \n  \n The value of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.AssemblyAssociatedContentFileAttribute> implies the path to the content file relative to its position in the project. For example, if a content file was located in a project subfolder, the additional path information would be incorporated into the                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.AssemblyAssociatedContentFileAttribute> value.  \n  \n `[assembly: AssemblyAssociatedContentFile(\"Resources/ContentFile.xaml\")]`  \n  \n The                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.AssemblyAssociatedContentFileAttribute> value is also the value of the path to the content file in the build output folder.  \n  \n### Using Content Files  \n To load a content file, you can call the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetContentStream%2A> method of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class, passing a pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that identifies the desired content file.                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetContentStream%2A> returns a                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.StreamResourceInfo> object, which exposes the content file as a                          <xref:System.IO.Stream> and describes its content type.  \n  \n As an example, the following code shows how to use                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetContentStream%2A> to load a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> content file and set it as the content of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> (                         `pageFrame`).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageContentFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/CSharp/ResourcesSample/ApplicationGetContentStreamSnippetWindow.xaml.cs#loadapagecontentfilemanuallycode)]\n [!code-vb[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageContentFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/VisualBasic/ResourcesSample/ApplicationGetContentStreamSnippetWindow.xaml.vb#loadapagecontentfilemanuallycode)]  \n  \n While calling                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetContentStream%2A> gives you access to the                          <xref:System.IO.Stream>, you need to perform the additional work of converting it to the type of the property that you'll be setting it with.

But, there are times when you may want to establish either an implicit or non-existent relationship between an assembly and an application data file, including when:  \n  \n-   A file doesn't exist when at compile time.  \n  \n-   You don't know what files your assembly will require until run time.  \n  \n-   You want to be able to update files without recompiling the assembly that they are associated with.  \n  \n-   Your application uses large data files, such as audio and video, and you only want users to download them if they choose to.  \n  \n It is possible to load these types of files by using traditional                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] schemes, such as the file:/// and http:// schemes.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#AbsolutePackUriFileHttpReferenceXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/CSharp/ResourcesSample/AbsolutePackUriPage.xaml#absolutepackurifilehttpreferencexaml)]  \n  \n However, the file:/// and http:// schemes require your application to have full trust. If your application is a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)] that was launched from the Internet or intranet, and it requests only the set of permissions that are allowed for applications launched from those locations, loose files can only be loaded from the application's site of origin (launch location). Such files are known as                  *site of origin* files.  \n  \n Site of origin files are the only option for partial trust applications, although are not limited to partial trust applications. Full trust applications may still need to load application data files that they do not know about at build time; while full trust applications could use file:///, it is likely that the application data files will be installed in the same folder as, or a subfolder of, the application assembly. In this case, using site of origin referencing is easier than using file:///, because using file:/// requires you to work out the full path the file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Site of origin files are not cached with an                      [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)] on a client machine, while content files are. Consequently, they are only downloaded when specifically requested. If an                      [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)] application has large media files, configuring them as site of origin files means the initial application launch is much faster, and the files are only downloaded on demand.  \n  \n### Configuring Site of Origin Files  \n If your site of origin files are non-existent or unknown at compile time, you need to use traditional deployment mechanisms for ensuring the required files are available at run time, including using either the                          `XCopy` command-line program or the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wininstall](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wininstall-md.md)].  \n  \n If you do know at compile time the files that you would like to be located at the site of origin, but still want to avoid an explicit dependency, you can add those files to an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] project as                          `None` item. As with content files, you need to set the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`CopyToOutputDirectory` attribute to specify that the site of origin file is copied to a location that is relative to the built assembly, by specifying either the                          `Always` value or the                          `PreserveNewest` value.  \n  \n```  \n<Project  \n                        xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003\" ... >  \n  ...  \n  <None Include=\"PageSiteOfOriginFile.xaml\">  \n    <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>  \n  </None>  \n  ...  \n</Project>  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In                              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-visualstu-md.md)], you create a site of origin file by adding a file to a project and setting its                              `Build Action` to                              `None`.  \n  \n When the project is built,                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)] copies the specified files to the build output folder.  \n  \n### Using Site of Origin Files  \n To load a site of origin file, you can call the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetRemoteStream%2A> method of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class, passing a pack                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uri-md.md)] that identifies the desired site of origin file.                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetRemoteStream%2A> returns a                          <xref:System.Windows.Resources.StreamResourceInfo> object, which exposes the site of origin file as a                          <xref:System.IO.Stream> and describes its content type.  \n  \n As an example, the following code shows how to use                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetRemoteStream%2A> to load a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> site of origin file and set it as the content of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> (                         `pageFrame`).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageSOOFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/CSharp/ResourcesSample/SOOPage.xaml.cs#loadapagesoofilemanuallycode)]\n [!code-vb[WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets#LoadAPageSOOFileManuallyCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFAssemblyResourcesSnippets/VisualBasic/ResourcesSample/SOOPage.xaml.vb#loadapagesoofilemanuallycode)]  \n  \n While calling                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetRemoteStream%2A> gives you access to the                          <xref:System.IO.Stream>, you need to perform the additional work of converting it to the type of the property that you'll be setting it with.
