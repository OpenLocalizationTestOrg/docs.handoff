To optimize the performance and user experience of your application, we recommend using the asynchronous methods of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> and <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> classes when accessing [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] servers over the Web.  \n  \n Although the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] servers process HTTP requests asynchronously, some methods of the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client libraries are synchronous and wait until the entire request-response exchange is completed before continuing execution. The asynchronous methods of the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client libraries do not wait for this exchange to complete and can allow your application to maintain a responsive user interface in the meantime.  \n  \n You can perform asynchronous operations by using a pair of methods on the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> and <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> classes that start with *Begin* and *End* respectively. The *Begin* methods register a delegate that the service calls when the operation is complete. The *End* methods should be called in the delegate that is registered to handle the callback from the completed operations. When you call the *End* method to complete an asynchronous operation, you must do so from the same <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> or <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> instance that you used to begin the operation. Each *Begin* method takes a `state` parameter that can pass a state object to the callback. This state object is retrieved from the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> that is supplied with the callback and is used to call the corresponding *End* method to complete the asynchronous operation. For example, when you supply the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> instance as the `state` parameter when you call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A> method on the instance, the same <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> instance is returned by the <xref:System.IAsyncResult>. This instance of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> is then used to call the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method to complete the query operation. For more information, see [How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/how-to-execute-asynchronous-data-service-queries-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Only asynchronous operations are supported by the client libraries that are provided in the .NET Framework for Silverlight. For more information, see [WCF Data Services (Silverlight)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=143149).  \n  \n The .NET Framework client libraries support the following asynchronous operations:  \n  \n|Operation|Methods|  \n|---------------|-------------|  \n|Executing a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601>.|-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A><br />-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A>|  \n|Executing a query from the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>.|-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.BeginExecute%2A><br />-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.EndExecute%2A>|  \n|Executing a batch query from the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>.|-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.BeginExecuteBatch%2A><br />-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.EndExecuteBatch%2A>|  \n|Loading a related entity into the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>.|-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.BeginLoadProperty%2A><br />-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.EndLoadProperty%2A>|  \n|Saving changes to objects in the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext>|-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.BeginSaveChanges%2A><br />-   <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.EndSaveChanges%2A>|  \n  \n## Threading Considerations for Asynchronous Operations  \n In a multi-threaded application, the delegate that is registered as a callback for the asynchronous operation is not necessarily invoked on the same thread that was used to call the *Begin* method, which creates the initial request. In an application where the callback must be invoked on a specific thread, you must explicitly marshal the execution of the *End* method, which handles the response, to the desired thread. For example, in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)-based applications and Silverlight-based applications, the response must be marshaled back to the UI thread by using the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.BeginInvoke%2A> method on the <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher> object.
