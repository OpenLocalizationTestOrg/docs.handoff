For an overview of all six of the tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.  \n  \n This topic describes how to host a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service in a console application. This procedure consists of the following steps:  \n  \n-   Create a console application project to host the service.  \n  \n-   Create a service host for the service.  \n  \n-   Enable metadata exchange.  \n  \n-   Open the service host.  \n  \n A complete listing of the code written in this task is provided in the example following the procedure.  \n  \n### To create a new console application to host the service  \n  \n1.  Create a new Console Application project by right-clicking on the Getting Started solution, selecting, **Add**, **New Project**. In the **Add New Project** dialog on the left hand side of the dialog select **Windows** under **C#** or **VB**. In the center section of the dialog select **Console Application**. Name the project GettingStartedHost.  \n  \n2.  Set the target framework of the GettingStartedHost project to .NET Framework 4.5 by right clicking on **GettingStartedHost** in the Solution Explorer and selecting **Properties**. In the dropdown box labeled **Target Framework** select **.NET Framework 4.5**. Setting the target framework for a VB project is a little different, in the GettingStartedHost project properties dialog, click the **Compile** tab on the left-hand side of the screen, and then click the **Advanced Compile Options** button at the lower left-hand corner of the dialog. Then select **.NET Framework 4.5** in the dropdown box labeled **Target Framework**.  \n  \n     Setting the target framework will cause [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] to reload the solution, press **OK** when prompted.  \n  \n3.  Add a reference to the GettingStartedLib project to the GettingStartedHost project by right clicking on the **References** folder under the GettingStartedHost project in the solution explorer and select **Add Reference**. In the **Add Reference** dialog, select **Solution** on the left-hand side of the dialog and select GettingStartedLib in the center section of the dialog and click **Add**. This makes the types defined in GettingStartedLib available to the GettingStartedHost project.  \n  \n4.  Add a reference to System.ServiceModel to the GettingStartedHost project by right-clicking the **Reference** folder under the GettingStartedHost project in Solution Explorer and select **Add** Reference. In the **Add Reference** dialog select **Framework** on the left-hand side of the dialog. In the Search Assemblies textbox, type in `System.ServiceModel`. In the center section of the dialog select **System.ServiceModel**, click the **Add** button, and click the **Close** button. Save the solution by clicking the Save All button below the main menu.  \n  \n### To host the service  \n  \n-   Open the Program.cs or Module.vb file and enter the following code:  \n  \n    ```  \n    // program.cs  \n    using System;  \n    using System.Collections.Generic;  \n    using System.Linq;  \n    using System.Text;  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    using GettingStartedLib;  \n    using System.ServiceModel.Description;   \n  \n    namespace GettingStartedHost  \n    {  \n        class Program  \n        {  \n            static void Main(string[] args)  \n            {  \n                // Step 1 Create a URI to serve as the base address.  \n                Uri baseAddress = new Uri(\"http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/\");  \n  \n                // Step 2 Create a ServiceHost instance  \n                ServiceHost selfHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService), baseAddress);  \n  \n                try  \n                {  \n                    // Step 3 Add a service endpoint.  \n                    selfHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator), new WSHttpBinding(), \"CalculatorService\");  \n  \n                    // Step 4 Enable metadata exchange.  \n                    ServiceMetadataBehavior smb = new ServiceMetadataBehavior();  \n                    smb.HttpGetEnabled = true;  \n                    selfHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb);  \n  \n                    // Step 5 Start the service.  \n                    selfHost.Open();  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"The service is ready.\");  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate service.\");  \n                    Console.WriteLine();  \n                    Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n                    // Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  \n                    selfHost.Close();  \n                }  \n                catch (CommunicationException ce)  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"An exception occurred: {0}\", ce.Message);  \n                    selfHost.Abort();  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```  \n    ‘Module1.vb  \n    Imports System  \n    Imports System.ServiceModel  \n    Imports System.ServiceModel.Description  \n    Imports GettingStartedLibVB.GettingStartedLib  \n  \n    Module Service  \n  \n        Class Program  \n            Shared Sub Main()  \n                ' Step 1 Create a URI to serve as the base address  \n                Dim baseAddress As New Uri(\"http://localhost:8000/ServiceModelSamples/Service\")  \n  \n                ' Step 2 Create a ServiceHost instance  \n                Dim selfHost As New ServiceHost(GetType(CalculatorService), baseAddress)  \n                Try  \n  \n                    ' Step 3 Add a service endpoint  \n                    ' Add a service endpoint  \n                    selfHost.AddServiceEndpoint( _  \n                        GetType(ICalculator), _  \n                        New WSHttpBinding(), _  \n                        \"CalculatorService\")  \n  \n                    ' Step 4 Enable metadata exchange.  \n                    Dim smb As New ServiceMetadataBehavior()  \n                    smb.HttpGetEnabled = True  \n                    selfHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(smb)  \n  \n                    ' Step 5 Start the service  \n                    selfHost.Open()  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"The service is ready.\")  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate service.\")  \n                    Console.WriteLine()  \n                    Console.ReadLine()  \n  \n                    ' Close the ServiceHostBase to shutdown the service.  \n                    selfHost.Close()  \n                Catch ce As CommunicationException  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"An exception occurred: {0}\", ce.Message)  \n                    selfHost.Abort()  \n                End Try  \n            End Sub  \n        End Class  \n  \n    End Module  \n    ```  \n  \n    1.  Step 1 - Creates an instance of the Uri class to hold the base address of the service. Services are identified by a URL which contains a base address and an optional URI. The base address is formatted as follows:[transport]://[machine-name or domain][:optional port #]/[optional URI segment]The base address for the calculator service uses the HTTP transport, localhost, port 8000, and the URI segment \"GettingStarted\"  \n  \n    2.  Step 2 – Creates an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> class to host the service. The constructor takes two parameters, the type of the class that implements the service contract, and the base address of the service.  \n  \n    3.  Step 3 – Creates a <!--zz <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceEndpoint>--> ` System.ServiceModel.ServiceEndpoint` instance. A service endpoint is composed of an address, a binding, and a service contract. The <!--zz <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceEndpoint>--> ` System.ServiceModel.ServiceEndpoint`  constructor therefore takes the service contract interface type, a binding, and an address. The service contract is `ICalculator`, which you defined and implement in the service type. The binding used in this sample is <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> which is a built-in binding that is used for connecting to endpoints that conform to the WS-* specifications. For more information about WCF bindings, see [WCF Bindings Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/bindings-overview.md). The address is appended to the base address to identify the endpoint. The address specified in this code is \"Calculator\" so the fully qualified address for the endpoint is `\"http://localhost:8000/GettingStartedService/Calculator\"` Adding a service endpoint is optional when using .NET Framework 4.0 or later. In these versions, if no endpoints are added in code or configuration, WCF adds one default endpoint for each combination of base address and contract implemented by the service. For more information about default endpoints see [Specifying an Endpoint Address](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-an-endpoint-address.md). [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors, see [Simplified Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md).  \n  \n        > [!IMPORTANT]\n        >  Adding a service endpoint is optional when using .NET Framework 4 or later. In these versions, if no endpoints are added in code or configuration, WCF adds one default endpoint for each combination of base address and contract implemented by the service. For more information about default endpoints see [Specifying an Endpoint Address](../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-an-endpoint-address.md).

Step 4 – Enable metadata exchange. Clients will use metadata exchange to generate proxies that will be used to call the service operations. To enable metadata exchange create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior> instance, set it’s <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceMetadataBehavior.HttpGetEnabled%2A> property to `true`, and add the behavior to the <!--zz <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost.Behaviors%2A>  -->`System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost.Behaviors%2A` collection of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> instance.  \n  \n    5.  Step 5 – Open the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> to listen for incoming messages. Notice the code waits for the user to hit enter. If you do not do this, the app will close immediately and the service will shut down.Also notice a  try/catch block used. After the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> has been instantiated, all other code is placed in a try/catch block. For more information about safely catching exceptions thrown by <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost>, see [Avoiding Problems with the Using Statement](../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/avoiding-problems-with-the-using-statement.md)  \n  \n### To verify the service is working  \n  \n1.  Run the GettingStartedHost console application from inside [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)]. When running on [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../includes/wv-md.md)] and later operating systems, the service must be run with administrator privileges. Because [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] was run with Administrator privileges, GettingStartedHost is also run with Administrator privileges. You can also start a new command prompt running it with Administrator privileges and run service.exe within it.  \n  \n2.  Open Internet Explorer and browse to the service's debug page at `http://localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService`.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example includes the service contract and implementation from previous steps in the tutorial and hosts the service in a console application.  \n  \n To compile this with a command-line compiler, compile IService1.cs and Service2.cs into a class library referencing `System.ServiceModel.dll`. And compile Program.cs to a console application.  \n  \n```  \n// IService1.cs  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;  \nusing System.ServiceModel;

 \n        }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n```  \n// Service1.cs  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;  \nusing System.ServiceModel;
