The following code illustrates these two invalid references.  \n  \n```vb  \nStructure Structure1  \n  \n    Public InstanceMember As Integer  \n  \n    Public Function ExampleFun() As Integer  \n        '' The error is caused by use of InstanceMember.  \n        'Dim fun1 = Function() InstanceMember  \n        '' The error is caused by use of Me.  \n        'Dim fun2 = Function() Me.InstanceMember  \n        'Return fun1()  \n    End Function  \n  \nEnd Structure  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36638  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Assign the instance member to a local variable, and use the local variable in your statement.  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Function ExampleFunFix() As Integer  \n    Dim temp = InstanceMember  \n    Dim fun1 = Function() temp  \n    Return fun1()  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Lambda Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)\n- [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)\n- [Structure Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,242],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36638\"\n  - \"bc36638\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36638\"\nms.assetid: 5c24a7c7-50f6-4ffb-9ed2-07e2abc4eaf3","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","pos":[0,81]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[249,330],"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","linkify":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and 'Me' cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","pos":[0,81]}]},{"content":"From within a structure, you have defined a lambda expression that refers to an instance member of the structure or uses <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph>.","pos":[331,457],"source":"From within a structure, you have defined a lambda expression that refers to an instance member of the structure or uses `Me`."},{"content":"The following code illustrates these two invalid references.","pos":[458,518]},{"pos":[924,945],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36638","source":"**Error ID:** BC36638"},{"pos":[954,975],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Assign the instance member to a local variable, and use the local variable in your statement.","pos":[985,1078]},{"pos":[1249,1257],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1261,1370],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept>","source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)"},{"pos":[1373,1465],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)</ept>","source":"[Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)"},{"pos":[1468,1562],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Structure Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Structure Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)"}]}
