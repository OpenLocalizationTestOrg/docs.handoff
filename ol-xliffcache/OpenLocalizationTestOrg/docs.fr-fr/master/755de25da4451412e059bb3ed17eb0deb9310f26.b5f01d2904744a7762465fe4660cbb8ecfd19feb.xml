Objects that inherit from `MarshalByRefObject` are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain. If any code ever attempts to directly access the value-type member of such an object across an application domain, a runtime exception will occur. To resolve the warning, first copy the member into a local variable and call the method on that variable.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS1690:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS1690.cs  \nusing System;  \n  \nclass WarningCS1690: MarshalByRefObject  \n{  \n   int i = 5;  \n  \n   public static void Main()   \n   {  \n     WarningCS1690 e = new WarningCS1690();  \n     e.i.ToString();   // CS1690  \n  \n     // OK  \n     int i = e.i;  \n     i.ToString();  \n     e.i = i;  \n   }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1690\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1690\"\nms.assetid: bc76efe0-4304-4449-8c11-950667aa8ac9","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1690","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Accessing a member on 'member' may cause a runtime exception because it is a field of a marshal-by-reference class","pos":[218,332]},{"content":"This warning occurs when you try to call a method, property, or indexer on a member of a class that derives from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.MarshalByRefObject&gt;</ph>, and the member is a value type.","pos":[339,517],"source":"This warning occurs when you try to call a method, property, or indexer on a member of a class that derives from <xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>, and the member is a value type."},{"content":"Objects that inherit from <ph id=\"ph1\">`MarshalByRefObject`</ph> are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain.","pos":[518,646],"source":" Objects that inherit from `MarshalByRefObject` are typically intended to be marshaled by reference across an application domain."},{"content":"If any code ever attempts to directly access the value-type member of such an object across an application domain, a runtime exception will occur.","pos":[647,793]},{"content":"To resolve the warning, first copy the member into a local variable and call the method on that variable.","pos":[794,899]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1690:","pos":[906,944]}]}
