To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush> object. The following example demonstrates how to fill an ellipse with a hatch pattern:  \n  \n## Example  \n The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background. The hatch style argument can be any value from the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration. There are more than fifty elements in the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration; a few of those elements are shown in the following list:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.Horizontal>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.Vertical>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.ForwardDiagonal>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.BackwardDiagonal>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.Cross>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle.DiagonalCross>  \n  \n The following illustration shows the filled ellipse.  \n  \n ![Hatch Pattern](./media/hatch1.png \"hatch1\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#41](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingABrush#41](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingABrush/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using a Brush to Fill Shapes](using-a-brush-to-fill-shapes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,333],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"patterns [Windows Forms], adding to shapes\"\n  - \"shapes [Windows Forms], filling with patterns\"\n  - \"brushes [Windows Forms], using hatch brushes\"\nms.assetid: 9c8300ff-187b-404f-af1f-ebd499f5b16f","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[340,381],"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","linkify":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Fill a Shape with a Hatch Pattern","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"A hatch pattern is made from two colors: one for the background and one for the lines that form the pattern over the background.","pos":[382,510]},{"content":"To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[511,612],"source":" To fill a closed shape with a hatch pattern, use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush> object."},{"content":"The following example demonstrates how to fill an ellipse with a hatch pattern:","pos":[613,692]},{"pos":[701,708],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A&gt;</ph> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background.","pos":[712,883],"source":"The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchBrush.%23ctor%2A> constructor takes three arguments: the hatch style, the color of the hatch line, and the color of the background."},{"content":"The hatch style argument can be any value from the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle&gt;</ph> enumeration.","pos":[884,990],"source":" The hatch style argument can be any value from the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle> enumeration."},{"content":"There are more than fifty elements in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.HatchStyle&gt;</ph> enumeration;
