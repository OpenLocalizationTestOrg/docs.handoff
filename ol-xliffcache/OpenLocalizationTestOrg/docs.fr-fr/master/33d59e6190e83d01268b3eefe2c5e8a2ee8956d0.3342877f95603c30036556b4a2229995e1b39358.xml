For example, if you define a class or structure that you use as the counter variable in a [For...Next Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md), Visual Basic requires both the `>=` and `<=` operators (as well as the `+` operator).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33033  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Define the matching operator in the same class or structure. Make every effort to define it meaningfully, because Visual Basic might use it in a situation you do not anticipate.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)\n- [Operators and Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/operators-and-expressions/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,234],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Matching '<operatorsymbol1>' operator is required for '<operatorsymbol2>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
