Such a class is called a *derived class*, and the class it inherits from is called the *base class*.  \n  \n It is meaningless for a class to inherit from itself, because it already possesses all its own members.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30257  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Check the spelling of the class name in the `Inherits` statement.  \n  \n2.  If you do not intend to inherit from a different class, remove the `Inherits` statement entirely.  \n  \n3.  Examine the cited message for suggestions.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,218],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Class '<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30257\"\n  - \"bc30257\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30257\"\nms.assetid: 03e3034c-a0fa-4619-84b9-5bc9aa0dfe80","nodes":[{"content":"Class '<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"Class '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;classname&gt;</ph>' cannot inherit from itself: <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;message&gt;</ph>","source":"Class '<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[225,284],"content":"Class '\\<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>","linkify":"Class '\\<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>","nodes":[{"content":"Class '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>classname&gt;' cannot inherit from itself: <ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>message&gt;","pos":[0,59],"source":"Class '\\<classname>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>"}]},{"pos":[285,427],"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inherits Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)</ept> in a class definition specifies its own class.","source":"An [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md) in a class definition specifies its own class."},{"content":"A class can inherit from another class, which provides it with all the members of the class it inherits from, so it does not have to define those members again.","pos":[434,594]},{"content":"Such a class is called a <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>derived class<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, and the class it inherits from is called the <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>base class<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept>.","pos":[595,695],"source":" Such a class is called a *derived class*, and the class it inherits from is called the *base class*."},{"content":"It is meaningless for a class to inherit from itself, because it already possesses all its own members.","pos":[702,805]},{"pos":[812,833],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30257","source":"**Error ID:** BC30257"},{"pos":[842,863],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[873,938],"content":"Check the spelling of the class name in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Inherits`</ph> statement.","source":"Check the spelling of the class name in the `Inherits` statement."},{"pos":[948,1045],"content":"If you do not intend to inherit from a different class, remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Inherits`</ph> statement entirely.","source":"If you do not intend to inherit from a different class, remove the `Inherits` statement entirely."},{"content":"Examine the cited message for suggestions.","pos":[1055,1097]},{"pos":[1106,1114],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1118,1252],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)</ept>","source":"[Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)"}]}
