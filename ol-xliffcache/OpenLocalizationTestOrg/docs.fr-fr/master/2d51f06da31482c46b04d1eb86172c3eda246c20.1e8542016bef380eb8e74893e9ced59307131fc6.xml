In the following example, you have a `Person` object with a string property named `PersonName`. The `Person` object (in the line shown highlighted that contains the `<src>` element) is defined in the namespace called `SDKSample`.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[SimpleBinding#Instantiation](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleBinding/CSharp/Page1.xaml?highlight=9,37)]  \n  \n You can then bind the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control to the object in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)], as the highlighted line that contains the `<TextBlock>` element shows. \n  \n Alternatively, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class, as in the following example:  \n  \n [!code-xaml[ObjectDataProvider}](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/SimpleBinding/VisualBasic/Page1.xaml?highlight=10-14,42)]  \n  \n You define the binding the same way, as the highlighted line that contains the `<TextBlock>` element shows.  \n  \n In this particular example, the result is the same: you have a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> with the text content `Joe`. However, the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class provides functionality such as the ability to bind to the result of a method. You can choose to use the <xref:System.Windows.Data.ObjectDataProvider> class if you need the functionality it provides.  \n  \n However, if you are binding to an object that has already been created, you need to set the `DataContext` in code, as in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[ADODataSet#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ADODataSet/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[ADODataSet#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ADODataSet/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#1)]  \n  \n To access [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] data for binding using the <xref:System.Windows.Data.XmlDataProvider> class, see [Bind to XML Data Using an XMLDataProvider and XPath Queries](how-to-bind-to-xml-data-using-an-xmldataprovider-and-xpath-queries.md).

For information about what types of data you can bind to or how to implement your own [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] objects for binding, see [Binding Sources
