HTTP Digest authentication only supports the 'Impersonation' level when used with an explicit credential.|  \n|FramingContentTypeMismatch|The specified content type was not supported by the specified service. The client and service bindings may be mismatched.|  \n|Hosting_SslSettingsMisconfigured|The Secure Sockets Layer settings for the specified service do not match those of the Internet Information Services.|  \n|HttpAuthSchemeAndClientCert|The HTTPS listener factory was configured to require a client certificate and the specified authentication scheme. However, only one form of client authentication can be required at one time.|  \n|HttpReceiveFailure|An error occurred while receiving the HTTP response to the specified. The service endpoint binding may not be using the HTTP protocol. Another possibility is that an HTTP request context was terminated by the server because of a service shutting down. See the server logs for more details.|  \n|HttpRegistrationAccessDenied|HTTP cannot register the specified URL. Your process does not have access rights to this namespace (see [Namespace Reservations, Registrations, and Routing](/windows/desktop/http/namespace-reservations-registrations-and-routing) for details).|  \n|HttpRegistrationAlreadyExists|HTTP cannot register the specified URL. Another application already registered this URL with HTTP.SYS.|  \n|HttpRegistrationPortInUse|HTTP cannot register the specified URL because the specified TCP port is being used by another application.|  \n|HttpSendFailure|An error occurred while making the HTTP request to the specified. Ensure that the cause is not a security binding mismatch. Also ensure that the service is not configured for Secure Sockets Layer.|  \n|MessageXmlProtocolError|A problem occurred with the XML that was received from the network. See the inner exception for more details.|  \n|MissingContentType|The receiver returned an error that indicates that the content type was missing on the request to the specified. See the inner exception for more information.|  \n|ProxyAuthenticationLevelMismatch|The HTTP proxy authentication credential specified a mutual authentication requirement that is stricter than the requirement for the target server authentication.|  \n|ProxyImpersonationLevelMismatch|The HTTP proxy authentication credential specified an impersonation level restriction that is stricter than the restriction for the target server authentication.|  \n|SecureChannelFailure|A secure channel cannot be established for Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security with the specified authority.|  \n|TrustFailure|A trust relationship cannot be established for the Secure Socket Layer/ Transport Layer Security secure channel with the specified authority.|  \n|UseDefaultWebProxyCantBeUsedWithExplicitProxyAddress|You cannot specify an explicit proxy address as well as UseDefaultWebProxy=true in your HttpTransportBinding element.|\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,134],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Core Communications: HTTP-HTTPS Transport Channels\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
