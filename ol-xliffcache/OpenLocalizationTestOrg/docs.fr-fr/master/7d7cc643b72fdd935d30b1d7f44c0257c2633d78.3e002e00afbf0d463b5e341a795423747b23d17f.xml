You cannot expand the accessibility, meaning you cannot make the overriding method more accessible than the method it overrides. For example, if the base class method is `Protected`, you cannot override it with a `Public` method.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32203  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the `Overrides` keyword, or change the accessibility to be at least as restrictive as that of the base class method.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)\n- [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)\n- [Shadowing in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/shadowing.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,249],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32203\"\n  - \"bc32203\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32203\"\nms.assetid: ef7816a4-5f57-4346-80fc-9311bc150b6b","nodes":[{"content":"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,88],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;method1&gt;</ph>' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;method2&gt;</ph>' because it expands the access of the base method","source":"'<method1>' cannot override '<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[256,346],"content":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method","linkify":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>method1&gt;' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>method2&gt;' because it expands the access of the base method","pos":[0,90],"source":"'\\<method1>' cannot override '\\<method2>' because it expands the access of the base method"}]},{"content":"A procedure specifies <ph id=\"ph1\">`Overrides`</ph> but declares an accessibility less restrictive than that of the method to be overridden.","pos":[347,469],"source":"A procedure specifies `Overrides` but declares an accessibility less restrictive than that of the method to be overridden."},{"content":"You cannot expand the accessibility, meaning you cannot make the overriding method more accessible than the method it overrides.","pos":[470,598]},{"content":"For example, if the base class method is <ph id=\"ph1\">`Protected`</ph>, you cannot override it with a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Public`</ph> method.","pos":[599,699],"source":" For example, if the base class method is `Protected`, you cannot override it with a `Public` method."},{"pos":[706,727],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32203","source":"**Error ID:** BC32203"},{"pos":[736,757],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[767,890],"content":"Remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Overrides`</ph> keyword, or change the accessibility to be at least as restrictive as that of the base class method.","source":"Remove the `Overrides` keyword, or change the accessibility to be at least as restrictive as that of the base class method."},{"pos":[899,907],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[911,1117],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overriding properties and methods in derived classes<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)</ept>","source":"[Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)"},{"pos":[1120,1242],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Access levels in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)</ept>","source":"[Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)"},{"pos":[1245,1359],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shadowing in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/shadowing.md)</ept>","source":"[Shadowing in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/shadowing.md)"}]}
