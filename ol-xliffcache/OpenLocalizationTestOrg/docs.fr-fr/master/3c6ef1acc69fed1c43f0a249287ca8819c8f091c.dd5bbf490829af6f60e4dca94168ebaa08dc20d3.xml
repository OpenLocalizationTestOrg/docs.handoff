The result of a unary `+` operation on a numeric type is just the value of the operand.  \n  \n Binary `+` operators are predefined for numeric and string types. For numeric types, + computes the sum of its two operands. When one or both operands are of type string, + concatenates the string representations of the operands.  \n  \n Delegate types also provide a binary `+` operator, which performs delegate concatenation.  \n  \n User-defined types can overload the unary `+` and binary `+` operators. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.
