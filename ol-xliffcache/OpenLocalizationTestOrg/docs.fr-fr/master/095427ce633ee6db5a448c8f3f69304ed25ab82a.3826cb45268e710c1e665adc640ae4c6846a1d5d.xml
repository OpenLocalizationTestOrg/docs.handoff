You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control to implement layouts that respond gracefully as controls resize due to changes in their <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property values.  \n  \n## Example  \n This form demonstrates how to create a layout that proportionally adjusts when you translate displayed string values into other languages. This process of translation is called *localization*. For more information, see [Localization](../../../standard/globalization-localization/localization.md).  \n  \n There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.  See also [Walkthrough: Creating a Layout That Adjusts Proportion for Localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/7k9fa71y(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.LocalizableForm#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.LocalizableForm/CS/localizableform.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.LocalizableForm#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel.LocalizableForm/VB/localizableform.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Additional resources\n1.
