It shows how to create a functionally equivalent [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] version of an ASP.NET AJAX service. The two services can then be used side by side, or the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service can be used to replace the ASP.NET AJAX service.  \n  \n Migrating an existing ASP.NET AJAX service to a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] AJAX service gives you the following benefits:  \n  \n-   You can expose your AJAX service as a SOAP service with minimal extra configuration.  \n  \n-   You can benefit from [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] features such as tracing, and so on.  \n  \n The following procedures assume that you are using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n The code that results from the procedures outlined in this topic is provided in the example following the procedures.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] exposing a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service through an AJAX-enabled endpoint, see the [How to: Use Configuration to Add an ASP.NET AJAX Endpoint](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-configuration-to-add-an-aspnet-ajax-endpoint.md) topic.  \n  \n### To create and test the ASP.NET Web service application  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  From the **File** menu, select **New**, then **Project**, then **Web**, and then select **ASP.NET Web Service Application**.  \n  \n3.  Name the project `ASPHello` and click **OK**.  \n  \n4.  Uncomment the line in the Service1.asmx.cs file that contains `System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]` to enable AJAX for this service.  \n  \n5.  From the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.  \n  \n6.  From the **Debug** menu, select **Start Without Debugging**.  \n  \n7.  On the Web page generated, select the `HelloWorld` operation.  \n  \n8.  Click the **Invoke** button on the `HelloWorld` test page. You should receive the following XML response.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n    <string xmlns=\"http://tempuri.org/\">Hello World</string>  \n    ```  \n  \n9. This response confirms that you now have a functioning ASP.NET AJAX service and, in particular, that the service has now exposed an endpoint at Service1.asmx/HelloWorld that responds to HTTP POST requests and returns XML.  \n  \n     Now you are ready to convert this service to use a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] AJAX service.  \n  \n### To create an equivalent WCF AJAX service application  \n  \n1.  Right-click the **ASPHello** project and select **Add**, then **New Item**, and then **AJAX-enabled WCF Service**.  \n  \n2.  Name the service `WCFHello` and click **Add**.  \n  \n3.  Open the WCFHello.svc.cs file.  \n  \n4.  From Service1.asmx.cs, copy the following implementation of the `HelloWorld` operation.  \n  \n    ```  \n    public string HelloWorld()  \n    {  \n         return \"Hello World\";  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Paste to copied implementation of the `HelloWorld` operation into the WCFHello.svc.cs file in place of the following code.  \n  \n    ```  \n    public void DoWork()  \n    {  \n          // Add your operation implementation here  \n          return;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Specify the `Namespace` attribute for <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> as `WCFHello`.  \n  \n    ```  \n    [ServiceContract(Namespace=\"WCFHello\")]  \n    [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode=AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Required)]  \n    public class WCFHello  \n    { … }  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  Add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> to the `HelloWorld` operation and set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute.ResponseFormat%2A> property to return <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebMessageFormat>. Note that, if not set, the default return type is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebMessageFormat>.  \n  \n    ```  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    [WebInvoke(ResponseFormat=WebMessageFormat.Xml)]  \n    public string HelloWorld()  \n    {  \n        return \"Hello World\";  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n8.  From the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.  \n  \n9. Open the WCFHello.svc file and from the **Debug** menu, select **Start Without Debugging**.  \n  \n10. The service now exposes an endpoint at `WCFHello.svc/HelloWorld`, which responds to HTTP POST requests. HTTP POST requests cannot be tested from the browser, but the endpoint returns XML following XML.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <string xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/\">Hello World</string>  \n    ```  \n  \n11. The `WCFHello.svc/HelloWorld` and the `Service1.aspx/HelloWorld` endpoints are now functionally equivalent.  \n  \n## Example  \n The code that results from the procedures outlined in this topic is provided in the following example.  \n  \n```  \n//This is the ASP.NET code in the Service1.asmx.cs file.  \n  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Collections;  \nusing System.ComponentModel;  \nusing System.Data;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Web;  \nusing System.Web.Services;  \nusing System.Web.Services.Protocols;  \nusing System.Xml.Linq;  \nusing System.Web.Script.Services;  \n  \nnamespace ASPHello  \n{  \n    /// <summary>  \n    /// Summary description for Service1.  \n    /// </summary>  \n    [WebService(Namespace = \"http://tempuri.org/\")]  \n    [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]  \n    [ToolboxItem(false)]  \n    // To allow this Web Service to be called from script, using ASP.NET AJAX, uncomment the following line.   \n    [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]  \n    public class Service1 : System.Web.Services.WebService  \n    {  \n  \n        [WebMethod]  \n        public string HelloWorld()  \n        {  \n            return \"Hello World\";  \n        }  \n    }  \n}   \n  \n//This is the WCF code in the WCFHello.svc.cs file.  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Runtime.Serialization;  \nusing System.ServiceModel;  \nusing System.ServiceModel.Activation;  \nusing System.ServiceModel.Web;  \n  \nnamespace ASPHello  \n{  \n    [ServiceContract(Namespace = \"WCFHello\")]  \n    [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)]  \n    public class WCFHello  \n    {  \n        // Add [WebInvoke] attribute to use HTTP GET.  \n        [OperationContract]  \n        [WebInvoke(ResponseFormat=WebMessageFormat.Xml)]  \n        public string HelloWorld()  \n        {  \n            return \"Hello World\";  \n        }  \n  \n        // Add more operations here and mark them with [OperationContract].  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument> type is not supported by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> because it is not serializable by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>. You can use either an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> type, or serialize the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDocument.DocumentElement%2A> instead.  \n  \n If ASMX Web services are being upgraded and migrated side-by-side to [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services, avoid mapping two types to the same name on the client. This causes an exception in serializers if the same type is used in a <xref:System.Web.Services.WebMethodAttribute> and a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>:  \n  \n-   If [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service is added first, invoking the method on ASMX Web Service causes exception in <xref:System.Web.UI.ObjectConverter.ConvertValue%28System.Object%2CSystem.Type%2CSystem.String%29> because the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] style definition of the order in the proxy takes precedence.  \n  \n-   If ASMX Web Service is added first, invoking method on [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service causes exception in <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> because the Web Service style definition of the order in the proxy takes precedence.  \n  \n There are significant differences in behavior between the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> and the ASP.NET AJAX <xref:System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer>. For example, the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> represents a dictionary as an array of key/value pairs, whereas the ASP.NET AJAX <xref:System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer> represents a dictionary as actual JSON objects. So the following is the dictionary represented in ASP.NET AJAX.  \n  \n```  \nDictionary<string, int> d = new Dictionary<string, int>();  \nd.Add(\"one\", 1);  \nd.Add(\"two\", 2);  \n```  \n  \n This dictionary is represented in JSON objects as shown in the following list:  \n  \n-   [{\"Key\":\"one\",\"Value\":1},{\"Key\":\"two\",\"Value\":2}] by the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer>  \n  \n-   {\"one\":1,\"two\":2} by the ASP.NET AJAX <xref:System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer>  \n  \n The <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Json.DataContractJsonSerializer> is more powerful in the sense that it can handle dictionaries where the key type is not string, while the <xref:System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer> cannot. But the latter is more JSON-friendly.  \n  \n The significant differences between these serializers are summarized in the following table.  \n  \n|Category of Differences|DataContractJsonSerializer|ASP.NET AJAX JavaScriptSerializer|  \n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|  \n|Deserializing the empty buffer (new byte[0]) into <xref:System.Object> (or <xref:System.Uri>, or some other classes).|SerializationException|null|  \n|Serialization of <xref:System.DBNull.Value>|{} (or {\"__type\":\"#System\"})|Null|  \n|Serialization of the private members of [Serializable] types.|serialized|not serialized|  \n|Serialization of the public properties of <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable> types.|not serialized|serialized|  \n|\"Extensions\" of JSON|Adheres to the JSON specification, which requires quotes on object member names ({\"a\":\"hello\"}).|Supports the names of object members without quotes ({a:\"hello\"}).|  \n|<xref:System.DateTime> Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)|Does not support format \"\\\\/Date(123456789U)\\\\/\" or \"\\\\/Date\\\\(\\d+(U&#124;(\\\\+\\\\-[\\d{4}]))?\\\\)\\\\\\\\/)\".|Supports format \"\\\\/Date(123456789U)\\\\/\" and \"\\\\/Date\\\\(\\d+(U&#124;(\\\\+\\\\-[\\d{4}]))?\\\\)\\\\\\\\/)\" as DateTime values.|  \n|Representation of dictionaries|An array of KeyValuePair\\<K,V>, handles key types that are not strings.|As actual JSON objects - but only handles key types that are strings.|  \n|Escaped characters|Always with an escape forward slash (/); never allows un-escaped invalid JSON characters, such as \"\\n\".|With an escape forward slash (/) for DateTime values.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Use Configuration to Add an ASP.NET AJAX
