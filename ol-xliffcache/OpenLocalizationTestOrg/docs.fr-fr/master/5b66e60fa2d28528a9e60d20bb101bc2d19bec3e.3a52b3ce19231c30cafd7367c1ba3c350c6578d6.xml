The topics in this section provide information on mouse and keyboard user input, including code examples that demonstrate how to perform specific tasks.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [User Input in a Windows Forms Application](user-input-in-a-windows-forms-application.md)  \n Provides an overview of user input events and the methods that process Windows messages.  \n  \n [Keyboard Input in a Windows Forms Application](keyboard-input-in-a-windows-forms-application.md)  \n Provides information on keyboard message handling, the different types of keys, and the keyboard events.  \n  \n [Mouse Input in a Windows Forms Application](mouse-input-in-a-windows-forms-application.md)  \n Provides information on the mouse events and other mouse-related features, including mouse cursors and mouse capture.  \n  \n [How to: Simulate Mouse and Keyboard Events in Code](how-to-simulate-mouse-and-keyboard-events-in-code.md)  \n Demonstrates several different ways to programmatically simulate mouse and keyboard input.  \n  \n [How to: Handle User Input Events in Windows Forms Controls](how-to-handle-user-input-events-in-windows-forms-controls.md)  \n Presents a code example that handles most user input events and reports information about each event.  \n  \n [User Input Validation in Windows Forms](user-input-validation-in-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes the methods to validate user input in Windows Forms applications.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n Also see [Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms](creating-event-handlers-in-windows-forms.md).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,332],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"User Input in Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
