connect to remote network services and as a server to listen for connections from remote clients.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Synchronous Client Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-client-socket-example.md)  \n Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  \n  \n [Synchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md)  \n Shows how to implement a synchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.  \n  \n [Asynchronous Client Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-client-socket-example.md)  \n Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> client that connects to a server and displays the data returned from the server.  \n  \n [Asynchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/asynchronous-server-socket-example.md)  \n Shows how to implement an asynchronous <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> server that accepts connections from a client and echoes back the data received from the client.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/sockets.md)  \n Provides basic information about the <xref:System.Net.Sockets> namespace and the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class.  \n  \n [Security in Network Programming](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/security-in-network-programming.md)  \n Describes how to use standard Internet security and authentication techniques.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,49],"content":"Socket Code Examples | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Socket Code Examples | Microsoft
