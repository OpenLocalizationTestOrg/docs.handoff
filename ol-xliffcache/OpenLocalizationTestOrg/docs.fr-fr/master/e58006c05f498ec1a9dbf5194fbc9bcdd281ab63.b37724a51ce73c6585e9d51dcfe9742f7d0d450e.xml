Each option is available in two interchangeable forms: `-``option` and `/``option`. This documentation shows only the `/``option` form.  \n  \n The following table lists some sample command lines you can modify for your own use.  \n  \n|To|Use|  \n|--------|---------|  \n|Compile File.vb and create File.exe|`vbc /reference:Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll File.vb`|  \n|Compile File.vb and create File.dll|`vbc /target:library File.vb`|  \n|Compile File.vb and create My.exe|`vbc /out:My.exe File.vb`|  \n|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] files in the current directory, with optimizations on and the `DEBUG` symbol defined, producing File2.exe|`vbc /define:DEBUG=1 /optimize /out:File2.exe *.vb`|  \n|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] files in the current directory, producing a debug version of File2.dll without displaying the logo or warnings|`vbc /target:library /out:File2.dll /nowarn /nologo /debug *.vb`|  \n|Compile all [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] files in the current directory to Something.dll|`vbc /target:library /out:Something.dll *.vb`|  \n  \n When compiling from the command line, you must explicitly reference the Microsoft [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] run-time library through the `/reference` compiler option.  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  When you build a project by using the Visual Studio IDE, you can display information about the associated **vbc** command with its compiler options in the output window.
