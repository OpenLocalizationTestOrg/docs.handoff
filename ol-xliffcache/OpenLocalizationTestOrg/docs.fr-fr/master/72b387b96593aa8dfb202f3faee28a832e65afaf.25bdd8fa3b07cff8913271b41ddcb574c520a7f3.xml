You can enable your control to appear in this dialog box by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure.  \n  \n### To display your control in the Choose Toolbox Items dialog box  \n  \n-   Install your control assembly to the global assembly cache. For more information, see [How to: Install an Assembly into the Global Assembly Cache](../../../../docs/framework/app-domains/how-to-install-an-assembly-into-the-gac.md)  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Register your control and its associated design-time assemblies by using the AssemblyFoldersEx registration procedure. AssemblyFoldersEx is a registry location where third-party vendors store paths for each version of the framework that they support. Design-time resolution can look in this registry location to find reference assemblies. The registry script can specify the controls you want to appear in the Toolbox.
