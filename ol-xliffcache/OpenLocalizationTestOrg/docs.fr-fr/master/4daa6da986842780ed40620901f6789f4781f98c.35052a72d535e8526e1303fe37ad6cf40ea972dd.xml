This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>. You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xml[Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation>   \n [Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)   \n [3-D Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/3-d-graphics-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,689],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,76]}]}],"pos":[6,85],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
