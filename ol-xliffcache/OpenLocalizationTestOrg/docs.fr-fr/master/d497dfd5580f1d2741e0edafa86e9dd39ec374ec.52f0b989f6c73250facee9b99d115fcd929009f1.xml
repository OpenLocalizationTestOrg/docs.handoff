This walkthrough shows how you can use data binding in hybrid applications that include both [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  \n  \n-   Creating the project.  \n  \n-   Defining the data template.  \n  \n-   Specifying the form layout.  \n  \n-   Specifying data bindings.  \n  \n-   Displaying data by using interoperation.  \n  \n-   Adding the data source to the project.  \n  \n-   Binding to the data source.  \n  \n For a complete code listing of the tasks illustrated in this walkthrough, see [Data Binding in Hybrid Applications Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159983).  \n  \n When you are finished, you will have an understanding of data binding features in hybrid applications.  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   Visual Studio.  \n  \n-   Access to the Northwind sample database running on Microsoft SQL Server.  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n  \n#### To create and set up the project  \n  \n1.  Create a WPF Application project named `WPFWithWFAndDatabinding`.  \n  \n2.  In Solution Explorer, add references to the following assemblies.  \n  \n    -   WindowsFormsIntegration  \n  \n    -   System.Windows.Forms  \n  \n3.  Open MainWindow.xaml in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n4.  In the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element, add the following [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] namespaces mapping.  \n  \n    ```xaml  \n    xmlns:wf=\"clr-namespace:System.Windows.Forms;assembly=System.Windows.Forms\"  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Name the default <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element `mainGrid` by assigning the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Name%2A> property.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#8)]  \n  \n## Defining the Data Template  \n The master list of customers is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The following code example defines a <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> object named `ListItemsTemplate` that controls the visual tree of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. This <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate> is assigned to the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control's <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ItemsControl.ItemTemplate%2A> property.  \n  \n#### To define the data template  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#3)]  \n  \n## Specifying the Form Layout  \n The layout of the form is defined by a grid with three rows and three columns. <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label> controls are provided to identify each column in the Customers table.  \n  \n#### To set up the Grid layout  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#4)]  \n  \n#### To set up the Label controls  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#5)]  \n  \n## Specifying Data Bindings  \n The master list of customers is displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> control. The attached `ListItemsTemplate` binds a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> control to the `ContactName` field from the database.  \n  \n The details of each customer record are displayed in several <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls.  \n  \n#### To specify data bindings  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     The <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> class binds the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> controls to the appropriate fields in the database.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#6)]  \n  \n## Displaying Data by Using Interoperation  \n The orders corresponding to the selected customer are displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView?displayProperty=nameWithType> control named `dataGridView1`. The `dataGridView1` control is bound to the data source in the code-behind file. A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control is the parent of this [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control.  \n  \n#### To display data in the DataGridView control  \n  \n-   Copy the following XAML into the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element's declaration.  \n  \n     [!code-xaml[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml#7)]  \n  \n## Adding the Data Source to the Project  \n With Visual Studio, you can easily add a data source to your project. This procedure adds a strongly typed data set to your project. Several other support classes, such as table adapters for each of the chosen tables, are also added.  \n  \n#### To add the data source  \n  \n1.  From the **Data** menu, select **Add New Data Source**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, create a connection to the Northwind database by using a dataset. For more information, see [How to: Connect to Data in a Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/fxk9yw1t(v=vs.120)).  \n  \n3.  When you are prompted by the **Data Source Configuration Wizard**, save the connection string as `NorthwindConnectionString`.  \n  \n4.  When you are prompted to choose your database objects, select the `Customers` and `Orders` tables, and name the generated data set `NorthwindDataSet`.  \n  \n## Binding to the Data Source  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource?displayProperty=nameWithType> component provides a uniform interface for the application's data source. Binding to the data source is implemented in the code-behind file.  \n  \n#### To bind to the data source  \n  \n1.  Open the code-behind file, which is named MainWindow.xaml.vb or MainWindow.xaml.cs.  \n  \n2.  Copy the following code into the `MainWindow` class definition.  \n  \n     This code declares the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component and associated helper classes that connect to the database.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#11)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#11)]\n\n3.  Copy the following code into the constructor.\n\n     This code creates and initializes the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.\n\n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#12)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#12](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#12)]\n\n4.  Open MainWindow.xaml.\n\n5.  In Design view or XAML view, select the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element.\n\n6.  In the Properties window, click the **Events** tab.\n\n7.  Double-click the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.\n\n8.  Copy the following code into the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event handler.\n\n     This code assigns the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component as the data context and populates the `Customers` and `Orders` adapter objects.\n\n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#13)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#13](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#13)]\n\n9. Copy the following code into the `MainWindow` class definition.\n\n     This method handles the <xref:System.Windows.Data.CollectionView.CurrentChanged> event and updates the current item of the data binding.\n\n     [!code-csharp[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/CSharp/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.cs#14)]\n     [!code-vb[WPFWithWFAndDatabinding#14](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/VisualBasic/WPFWithWFAndDatabinding/Window1.xaml.vb#14)]  \n  \n10.
