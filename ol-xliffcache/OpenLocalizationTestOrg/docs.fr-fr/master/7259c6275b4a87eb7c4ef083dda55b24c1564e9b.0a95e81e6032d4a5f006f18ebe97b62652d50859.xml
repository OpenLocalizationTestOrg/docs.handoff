The WPF Host (PresentationHost.exe) is registered as the shell and MIME handler for XBAP and XAML files. Therefore, Internet Explorer knows to start the WPF Host when an XBAP is launched. Firefox users can install Firefox add-ons that enable Firefox to host XBAPs as well. An XBAP can be hosted in other browsers or stand-alone applications by using the native browser hosting APIs provided by WPF.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)  \n   [WPF Host (PresentationHost.exe)](wpf-host-presentationhost-exe.md)  \n  [Firefox Add-ons to Support .NET Application Deployment](firefox-add-ons-to-support-net-application-deployment.md)  \n  [Native WPF Browser Hosting Support APIs](native-wpf-browser-hosting-support-apis.md)  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Application Management Overview](application-management-overview.md)  \n  [Windows in WPF](windows-in-wpf-applications.md)  \n  [Navigation Overview](navigation-overview.md)  \n  [Build and Deploy](building-and-deploying-wpf-applications.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,281],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Hosting WPF Applications\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"AutoGeneratedOrientationPage\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WPF application [WPF], hosting\"\n  - \"application hosting [WPF]\"\n  - \"hosting applications [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: 1f73067d-c60a-4e9a-b513-c817ee7da3a1","nodes":[{"content":"Hosting WPF Applications","nodes":[{"pos":[0,24],"content":"Hosting WPF Applications","nodes":[{"content":"Hosting WPF Applications","pos":[0,24]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[288,312],"content":"Hosting WPF Applications","linkify":"Hosting WPF Applications","nodes":[{"content":"Hosting WPF Applications","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"WPF XAML Browser Applications (XBAPs) are rich-client applications that can be deployed to a Web server and started in a browser.","pos":[313,442]},{"content":"The WPF Host (PresentationHost.exe) is registered as the shell and MIME handler for XBAP and XAML files.","pos":[443,547]},{"content":"Therefore, Internet Explorer knows to start the WPF Host when an XBAP is launched.","pos":[548,630]},{"content":"Firefox users can install Firefox add-ons that enable Firefox to host XBAPs as well.","pos":[631,715]},{"content":"An XBAP can be hosted in other browsers or stand-alone applications by using the native browser hosting APIs provided by WPF.","pos":[716,841]},{"pos":[850,865],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[869,952],"source":"[WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WPF Host (PresentationHost.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](wpf-host-presentationhost-exe.md)</ept>","pos":[958,1025],"source":"[WPF Host (PresentationHost.exe)](wpf-host-presentationhost-exe.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Firefox Add-ons to Support .NET Application Deployment<ept id=\"p1\">](firefox-add-ons-to-support-net-application-deployment.md)</ept>","pos":[1030,1144],"source":"[Firefox Add-ons to Support .NET Application Deployment](firefox-add-ons-to-support-net-application-deployment.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Native WPF Browser Hosting Support APIs<ept id=\"p1\">](native-wpf-browser-hosting-support-apis.md)</ept>","pos":[1149,1234],"source":"[Native WPF Browser Hosting Support APIs](native-wpf-browser-hosting-support-apis.md)"},{"pos":[1243,1259],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Application Management Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](application-management-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1263,1332],"source":"[Application Management Overview](application-management-overview.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Windows in WPF<ept id=\"p1\">](windows-in-wpf-applications.md)</ept>","pos":[1337,1385],"source":"[Windows in WPF](windows-in-wpf-applications.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Navigation Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](navigation-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1390,1435],"source":"[Navigation Overview](navigation-overview.md)"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Build and Deploy<ept id=\"p1\">](building-and-deploying-wpf-applications.md)</ept>","pos":[1440,1502],"source":"[Build and Deploy](building-and-deploying-wpf-applications.md)"}]}
