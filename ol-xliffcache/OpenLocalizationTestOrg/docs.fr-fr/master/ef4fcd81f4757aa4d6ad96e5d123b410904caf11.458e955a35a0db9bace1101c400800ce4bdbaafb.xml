These methods can be divided into two categories: **Write**, **WriteLine**, and **Fail** all emit output unconditionally, whereas **WriteIf**, **WriteLineIf**, and **Assert** test a Boolean condition, and write or do not write based on the value of the condition. **WriteIf** and **WriteLineIf** emit output if the condition is `true`, and **Assert** emits output if the condition is `false`.  \n  \n When designing your tracing and debugging strategy, you should think about how you want the output to look. Multiple **Write** statements filled with unrelated information will create a log that is difficult to read. On the other hand, using **WriteLine** to put related statements on separate lines may make it difficult to distinguish what information belongs together. In general, use multiple **Write** statements when you want to combine information from multiple sources to create a single informative message, and use the **WriteLine** statement when you want to create a single, complete message.  \n  \n### To write a complete line  \n  \n1.  Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineIf%2A> method.  \n  \n     A carriage return is appended to the end of the message this method returns, so that the next message returned by **Write**, **WriteIf**, **WriteLine**, or **WriteLineIf** will begin on the following line:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim errorFlag As Boolean = False  \n    Trace.WriteLine(\"Error in AppendData procedure.\")  \n    Trace.WriteLineIf(errorFlag, \"Error in AppendData procedure.\")  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    bool errorFlag = false;  \n    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLine (\"Error in AppendData procedure.\");  \n    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteLineIf(errorFlag,   \n       \"Error in AppendData procedure.\");  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n### To write a partial line  \n  \n1.  Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.Write%2A> or <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteIf%2A> method.  \n  \n     The next message put out by a **Write**, **WriteIf**, **WriteLine**, or **WriteLineIf** will begin on the same line as the message put out by the **Write** or **WriteIf** statement:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim errorFlag As Boolean = False  \n    Trace.WriteIf(errorFlag, \"Error in AppendData procedure.\")  \n    Debug.WriteIf(errorFlag, \"Transaction abandoned.\")  \n    Trace.Write(\"Invalid value for data request\")  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    bool errorFlag = false;  \n    System.Diagnostics.Trace.WriteIf(errorFlag,   \n       \"Error in AppendData procedure.\");  \n    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteIf(errorFlag, \"Transaction abandoned.\");  \n    Trace.Write(\"Invalid value for data request\");  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n### To verify that certain conditions exist either before or after you execute a method  \n  \n1.  Call the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Trace.Assert%2A> method.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim I As Integer = 4  \n    Trace.Assert(I = 5, \"I is not equal to 5.\")  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    int I = 4;  \n    System.Diagnostics.Trace.Assert(I == 5, \"I is not equal to 5.\");  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can use **Assert** with both tracing and debugging. This example outputs the call stack to any listener in the **Listeners** collection.
