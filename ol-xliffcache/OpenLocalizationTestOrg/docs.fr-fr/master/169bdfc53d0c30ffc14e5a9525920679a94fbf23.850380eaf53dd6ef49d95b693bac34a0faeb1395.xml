The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`. The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csProgGuideObjects#16](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csProgGuideObjects/CS/Objects.cs#16)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ICloneable>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)\n- [Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)\n- [Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,243],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Write a Copy Constructor - C# Programming Guide\"\nms.custom: seodec18\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"C# Language, copy constructor\"\n  - \"copy constructor [C#]\"\nms.assetid: fba899b5-fc41-428e-a745-3ebdbf37990a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"pos":[0,55],"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor - C# Programming Guide","pos":[0,55]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[250,305],"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write a Copy Constructor (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"C# doesn't provide a copy constructor for objects, but you can write one yourself.","pos":[306,388]},{"pos":[397,404],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Person`</ph><bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>class<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md)</ept> defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of <ph id=\"ph2\">`Person`</ph>.","pos":[408,588],"source":"In the following example, the `Person`[class](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md) defines a copy constructor that takes, as its argument, an instance of `Person`."},{"content":"The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Person`</ph>.","pos":[589,697],"source":" The values of the properties of the argument are assigned to the properties of the new instance of `Person`."},{"content":"The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Name`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Age`</ph> properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class.","pos":[698,870],"source":" The code contains an alternative copy constructor that sends the `Name` and `Age` properties of the instance that you want to copy to the instance constructor of the class."},{"pos":[1007,1015],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1046,1112],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1115,1200],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Classes and Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)"},{"pos":[1203,1288],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Constructors<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)</ept>","source":"[Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)"},{"pos":[1291,1373],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Finalizers<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)</ept>","source":"[Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)"}]}
