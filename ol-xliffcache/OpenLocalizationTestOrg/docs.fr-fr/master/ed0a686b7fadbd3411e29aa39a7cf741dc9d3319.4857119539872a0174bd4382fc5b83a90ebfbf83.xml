For integral types, `^` computes the bitwise exclusive-OR of its operands. For `bool` operands, `^` computes the logical exclusive-or of its operands; that is, the result is `true` if and only if exactly one of its operands is `true`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n User-defined types can overload the `^` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csRefOperators#30](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/xor-operator_1.cs)]  \n  \n The computation of `0xf8 ^ 0x3f` in the previous example performs a bitwise exclusive-OR of the following two binary values, which correspond to the hexadecimal values F8 and 3F:  \n  \n `1111 1000`  \n  \n `0011 1111`  \n  \n The result of the exclusive-OR is `1100 0111`, which is C7 in hexadecimal.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Operators](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,591],"nodes":[{"content":"^ Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"^ Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"^ Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,42]}]}],"pos":[6,51],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"^ Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-csharp\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"^_CSharpKeyword\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"CSharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"^ operator [C#]\"\n  - \"bitwise exclusive OR operator [C#]\"\nms.assetid: b09bc815-570f-4db6-a637-5b4ed99d014a\ncaps.latest.revision: 19\nauthor: \"BillWagner\"\nms.author: \"wiwagn\"\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[598,623],"content":"^ Operator (C# Reference)","linkify":"^ Operator (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"^ Operator (C# Reference)","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"Binary <ph id=\"ph1\">`^`</ph> operators are predefined for the integral types and <ph id=\"ph2\">`bool`</ph>.","pos":[624,694],"source":"Binary `^` operators are predefined for the integral types and `bool`."},{"content":"For integral types, <ph id=\"ph1\">`^`</ph> computes the bitwise exclusive-OR of its operands.","pos":[695,769],"source":" For integral types, `^` computes the bitwise exclusive-OR of its operands."},{"content":"For <ph id=\"ph1\">`bool`</ph> operands, <ph id=\"ph2\">`^`</ph> computes the logical exclusive-or of its operands;
