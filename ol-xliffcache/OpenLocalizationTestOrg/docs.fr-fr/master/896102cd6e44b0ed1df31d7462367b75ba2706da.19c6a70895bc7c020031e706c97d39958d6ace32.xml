Some writers may require a file name. However, you can always pass a file name to this method without any negative effect on writers that do not use the file name.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT Initialize(  \n    [in] IUnknown     *emitter,  \n    [in] const WCHAR  *filename,  \n    [in] IStream      *pIStream,  \n    [in] BOOL         fFullBuild);  \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `emitter`  \n [in] A pointer to the metadata emitter interface.  \n  \n `filename`  \n [in] The file name to which the debugging symbols are written. If a file name is specified for a writer that does not use file names, this parameter is ignored.  \n  \n `pIStream`  \n [in] If specified, the symbol writer will emit the symbols into the given <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream> rather than to the file specified in the `filename` parameter. The `pIStream` parameter is optional.  \n  \n `fFullBuild`  \n [in] `true` if this is a full rebuild; `false` if this is an incremental compilation.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ISymUnmanagedWriter Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-interface.md)   \n [Initialize2 Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-initialize2-method.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[752,790],"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize Method","linkify":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize Method","nodes":[{"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize Method","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"Sets the metadata emitter interface with which this writer will be associated, and sets the output file name to which the debugging symbols will be written.","pos":[791,947]},{"content":"This method can be called only once, and it must be called before any other writer methods.","pos":[954,1045]},{"content":"Some writers may require a file name.","pos":[1046,1083]},{"content":"However, you can always pass a file name to this method without any negative effect on writers that do not use the file name.","pos":[1084,1209]},{"pos":[1218,1224],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1413,1423],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to the metadata emitter interface.","pos":[1440,1489]},{"content":"[in] The file name to which the debugging symbols are written.","pos":[1510,1572]},{"content":"If a file name is specified for a writer that does not use file names, this parameter is ignored.","pos":[1573,1670]},{"content":"[in] If specified, the symbol writer will emit the symbols into the given <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream&gt;</ph> rather than to the file specified in the <ph id=\"ph2\">`filename`</ph> parameter.","pos":[1691,1882],"source":" [in] If specified, the symbol writer will emit the symbols into the given <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream> rather than to the file specified in the `filename` parameter."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`pIStream`</ph> parameter is optional.","pos":[1883,1920],"source":" The `pIStream` parameter is optional."},{"content":"[in] <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> if this is a full rebuild; <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph> if this is an incremental compilation.","pos":[1943,2028],"source":" [in] `true` if this is a full rebuild; `false` if this is an incremental compilation."},{"pos":[2037,2049],"content":"Return Value","linkify":"Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Return Value","pos":[0,12]}]},{"content":"S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.","pos":[2053,2125]},{"pos":[2134,2146],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[2150,2182],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorSym.idl, CorSym.h","source":"**Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h"},{"pos":[2191,2199],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ISymUnmanagedWriter Interface<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-interface.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2203,2322],"source":"[ISymUnmanagedWriter Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-interface.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Initialize2 Method<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-initialize2-method.md)</ept>","pos":[2325,2442],"source":" [Initialize2 Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-initialize2-method.md)"}]}
