Nonshared constants, properties, and procedures do not satisfy this requirement. In addition, if there are no nonshared variables and only one nonshared event, that event cannot be a `Custom` event.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30941  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Define at least one variable or event that is not `Shared`.
