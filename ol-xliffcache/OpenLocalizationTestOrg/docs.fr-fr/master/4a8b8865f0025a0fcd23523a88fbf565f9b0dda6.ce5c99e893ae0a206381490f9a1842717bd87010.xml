class enables you to easily include sounds in your applications.  \n  \n You can also use the <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds> class to play common system sounds, including a beep.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SoundPlayer Class Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/soundplayer-class-overview.md)  \n Introduces the class and its commonly used properties, methods, and events.  \n  \n [How to: Play a Sound from a Windows Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-play-a-sound-from-a-windows-form.md)  \n Provides code to play a sound specified via a file path, UNC path, or HTTP path.  \n  \n [How to: Play a Beep from a Windows Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-play-a-beep-from-a-windows-form.md)  \n Provides code to play the computer's
