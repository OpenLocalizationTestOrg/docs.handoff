For more information about its use in extension methods, see [Extension Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods.md).\n\nThe following are common uses of `this`:\n\n- To qualify members hidden by similar names, for example:\n\n  [!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsAccess#4](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsAccess/CS/csrefKeywordsAccess.cs#4)]  \n\n- To pass an object as a parameter to other methods, for example:\n\n  ```csharp\n  CalcTax(this);\n  ```\n\n- To declare indexers, for example:\n\n  [!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsAccess#5](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsAccess/CS/csrefKeywordsAccess.cs#5)]\n\nStatic member functions, because they exist at the class level and not as part of an object, do not have a `this` pointer. It is an error to refer to `this` in a static method.\n\n## Example\n\nIn this example, `this` is used to qualify the `Employee` class members, `name` and `alias`, which are hidden by similar names. It is also used to pass an object to the method `CalcTax`, which belongs to another class.\n\n[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsAccess#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsAccess/CS/csrefKeywordsAccess.cs#3)]\n\n## C# language specification\n\n[!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](~/includes/csharplangspec-md.md)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [C# Reference](../index.md)\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../programming-guide/index.md)\n- [C# Keywords](index.md)\n- [base](base.md)\n- [Methods](../../programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,267],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"this keyword - C# Reference\"\nms.custom: seodec18\n\ndescription: this keyword (C# Reference)\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"this\"\n  - \"this_CSharpKeyword\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"this keyword [C#]\"\nms.assetid: d4f827fe-4710-410b-89b8-867dad44b8a3","nodes":[{"content":"this keyword - C# Reference","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"this keyword - C# Reference","nodes":[{"content":"this keyword - C# Reference","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"this keyword (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"this keyword (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"this keyword (C# Reference)","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[274,293],"content":"this (C# Reference)","linkify":"this (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"this (C# Reference)","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[295,435],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`this`</ph> keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method.","source":"The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class and is also used as a modifier of the first parameter of an extension method."},{"pos":[439,669],"content":"[!NOTE]\nThis article discusses the use of `this` with class instances.
