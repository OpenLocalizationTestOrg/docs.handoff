You can improve the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> when the user scrolls by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n## Description  \nThe following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> and sets the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType> to improve performance during scrolling.  \n  \n## Code  \n [!code-xaml[RecycleItemContainerShippets#VirtualizationMode](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml#virtualizationmode)]  \n  \n The following example shows the data that the previous example uses.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[RecycleItemContainerShippets#ListBoxData](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#listboxdata)]\n [!code-vb[RecycleItemContainerShippets#ListBoxData](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/RecycleItemContainerShippets/visualbasic/window1.xaml.vb#listboxdata)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,308],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ListBox control [WPF], reusing item containers\"\n  - \"ListBox control [WPF], improving scrolling performance\"\nms.assetid: 1e2bf8f3-c8ce-47f7-a400-a7fe11d1a848","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[315,369],"content":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","linkify":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Improve the Scrolling Performance of a ListBox","pos":[0,54]}]},{"content":"If a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox&gt;</ph> contains many items, the user interface response can be slow when a user scrolls the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox&gt;</ph> by using the mouse wheel or dragging the thumb of a scrollbar.","pos":[370,600],"source":"If a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> contains many items, the user interface response can be slow when a user scrolls the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> by using the mouse wheel or dragging the thumb of a scrollbar."},{"content":"You can improve the performance of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox&gt;</ph> when the user scrolls by setting the <ph id=\"ph2\">`VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode`</ph> attached property to <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>.","pos":[601,870],"source":" You can improve the performance of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> when the user scrolls by setting the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType>."},{"pos":[879,886],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[895,906],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"pos":[909,1187],"content":"The following example creates a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox&gt;</ph> and sets the <ph id=\"ph2\">`VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode`</ph> attached property to <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> to improve performance during scrolling.","source":"The following example creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> and sets the `VirtualizingStackPanel.VirtualizationMode` attached property to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizationMode.Recycling?displayProperty=nameWithType> to improve performance during scrolling."},{"pos":[1196,1200],"content":"Code","linkify":"Code","nodes":[{"content":"Code","pos":[0,4]}]},{"content":"The following example shows the data that the previous example uses.","pos":[1383,1451]}]}
