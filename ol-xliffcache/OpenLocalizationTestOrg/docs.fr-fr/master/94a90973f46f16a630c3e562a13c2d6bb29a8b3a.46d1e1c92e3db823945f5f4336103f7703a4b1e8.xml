Some of these activities (such as `Switch` and `If`) implement flow control structures similar to those in programming environments such as [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], while others (such as `Pick`) model new programming structures.  \n  \n Note that while activities such as the `Parallel` and `ParallelForEach` activities schedule multiple child activities for execution simultaneously, only a single thread is used for a workflow. Each child activity of these activities executes sequentially and successive activities do not execute until previous activities either complete or go idle. As a result, these activities are most useful for applications in which several potentially blocking activities must execute in an interleaved fashion. If none of the child activities of these activities go idle, a `Parallel` activity executes just like a `Sequence` activity, and a `ParallelForEach` activity executes just like a `ForEach` activity. If, however, asynchronous activities (such as activities that derive from <xref:System.Activities.AsyncCodeActivity>) or messaging activities are used, control will pass to the next branch while the child activity waits for its message to be received or its asynchronous work to be completed.  \n  \n## Flow control activities  \n  \n|Activity|Description|  \n|--------------|-----------------|
