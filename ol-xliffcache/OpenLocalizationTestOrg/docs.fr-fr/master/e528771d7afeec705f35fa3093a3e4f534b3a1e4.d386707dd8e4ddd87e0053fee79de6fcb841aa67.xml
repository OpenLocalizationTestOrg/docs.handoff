For example:\n\n```csharp\nClass1 obj  = new Class1();\n```\n\nIt is also used to create instances of anonymous types:\n\n```csharp\nvar query = from cust in customers\n            select new { Name = cust.Name, Address = cust.PrimaryAddress };\n```\n\nThe `new` operator is also used to invoke the default constructor for value types. For example:\n\n```csharp\nint i = new int();\n```\n\nIn the preceding statement, `i` is initialized to `0`, which is the default value for the type `int`. The statement has the same effect as the following:\n\n```csharp\nint i = 0;\n```\n\nFor a complete list of default values, see [Default Values Table](default-values-table.md).\n\nRemember that it is an error to declare a default constructor for a [struct](struct.md) because every value type implicitly has a public default constructor. It is possible to declare parameterized constructors on a struct type to set its initial values, but this is only necessary if values other than the default are required.\n\nBoth value-type objects such as structs and reference-type objects such as classes are destroyed automatically, but value-type objects are destroyed when their containing context is destroyed, whereas reference-type objects are destroyed by the garbage collector at an unspecified time after the last reference to them is removed. For types that contain resources such as file handles, or network connections, it is desirable to employ deterministic cleanup to ensure that the resources they contain are released as soon as possible. For more information, see [using Statement](using-statement.md).\n\nThe `new` operator cannot be overloaded.\n\nIf the `new` operator fails to allocate memory, it throws the exception, <xref:System.OutOfMemoryException>.\n\n## Example\n\nIn the following example, a `struct` object and a class object are created and initialized by using the `new` operator and then assigned values. The default and the assigned values are displayed.\n\n[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsOperator#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsOperator/CS/csrefKeywordsOperators.cs#7)]\n\nNotice in the example that the default value of a string is `null`. Therefore, it is not displayed.\n\n## C# language specification\n\n[!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](~/includes/csharplangspec-md.md)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [C# Reference](../../language-reference/index.md)\n-
