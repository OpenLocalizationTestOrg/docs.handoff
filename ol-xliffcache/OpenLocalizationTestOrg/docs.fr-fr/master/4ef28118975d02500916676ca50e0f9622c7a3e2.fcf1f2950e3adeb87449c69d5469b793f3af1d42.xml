The ellipse geometry's <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry.Center%2A> property, which takes a <xref:System.Windows.Point> value, specifies its position; to move the ellipse geometry, you animate its <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry.Center%2A> property. The example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.PointAnimationUsingPath> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry> object's <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry.Center%2A> property.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[PathAnimationGallery_snippet#PointAnimationUsingPathWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_snippet/CS/pointanimationusingpathexample.xaml#pointanimationusingpathwholepage)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip#PointAnimationUsingPathWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/PointAnimationUsingPathExample.cs#pointanimationusingpathwholepage)]\n [!code-vb[PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip#PointAnimationUsingPathWholePage](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/PointAnimationUsingPathExample.vb#pointanimationusingpathwholepage)]  \n  \n For the complete sample, see [Path Animation Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160028).  \n  \n The code version of the preceding sample used a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry>, even though only one animation was applied. A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> is often the easiest way to apply multiple animations because these animations can be controlled by the same <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard>. However, an easier way to apply a single animation to a property when using code is to use the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Animatable.BeginAnimation%2A> method. For an example, see [Animate a Property Without Using a Storyboard](how-to-animate-a-property-without-using-a-storyboard.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Path Animation Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160028)\n- [Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)\n- [Path Animation How-to Topics](path-animation-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,285],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"animation [WPF], objects along paths (point animation)\"\n  - \"point animation [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: 1fa3f817-35bc-41a1-b366-f5a20b70da0c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","pos":[0,56]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[292,348],"content":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","linkify":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate an Object Along a Path (Point Animation)","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[349,511],"content":"This example shows how to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.PointAnimationUsingPath&gt;</ph> object to animate a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Point&gt;</ph> along a curved path.","source":"This example shows how to use a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.PointAnimationUsingPath> object to animate a <xref:System.Windows.Point> along a curved path."},{"pos":[520,527],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example moves an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry&gt;</ph> along a path defined by a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.PathGeometry&gt;</ph>.","pos":[531,673],"source":"The following example moves an <xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry> along a path defined by a <xref:System.Windows.Media.PathGeometry>."},{"content":"The ellipse geometry's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.EllipseGeometry.Center%2A&gt;</ph> property, which takes a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Point&gt;</ph> value, specifies its position;
