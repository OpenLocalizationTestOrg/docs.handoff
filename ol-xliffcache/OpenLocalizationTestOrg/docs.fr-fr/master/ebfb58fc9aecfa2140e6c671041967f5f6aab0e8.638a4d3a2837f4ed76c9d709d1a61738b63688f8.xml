The following code illustrates these two invalid references.  \n  \n```vb  \nStructure Structure1  \n  \n    Public InstanceMember As Integer  \n  \n    Public Function ExampleFun() As Integer  \n        '' The error is caused by use of InstanceMember.  \n        'Dim fun1 = Function() InstanceMember  \n        '' The error is caused by use of Me.  \n        'Dim fun2 = Function() Me.InstanceMember  \n        'Return fun1()  \n    End Function  \n  \nEnd Structure  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36638  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Assign the instance member to a local variable, and use the local variable in your statement.  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Function ExampleFunFix() As Integer  \n    Dim temp = InstanceMember  \n    Dim fun1 = Function() temp  \n    Return fun1()  \nEnd Function  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Lambda Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)   \n [Me](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2)   \n [Structure Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,118],"content":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,106],"source":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[634,723],"content":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","linkify":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","nodes":[{"content":"Instance members and &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures","pos":[0,89],"source":"Instance members and &#39;Me&#39; cannot be used within a lambda expression in structures"}]},{"content":"From within a structure, you have defined a lambda expression that refers to an instance member of the structure or uses <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph>.","pos":[724,850],"source":"From within a structure, you have defined a lambda expression that refers to an instance member of the structure or uses `Me`."},{"content":"The following code illustrates these two invalid references.","pos":[851,911]},{"pos":[1317,1338],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36638","source":"**Error ID:** BC36638"},{"pos":[1347,1368],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Assign the instance member to a local variable, and use the local variable in your statement.","pos":[1378,1471]},{"pos":[1642,1650],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1654,1764],"source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1767,1843],"source":" [Me](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/a65973c7-cf06-4547-9b25-9fba885525c2) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Structure Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1846,1941],"source":" [Structure Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/structure-statement.md)"}]}
