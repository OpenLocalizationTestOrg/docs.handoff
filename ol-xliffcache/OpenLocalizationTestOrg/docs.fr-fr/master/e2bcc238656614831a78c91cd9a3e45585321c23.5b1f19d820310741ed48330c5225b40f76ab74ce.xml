The sample demonstrates how to host a control endpoint and write clients that call the control endpoint to create and run the instance of a workflow. The workflow is not a service.  \n  \n On the service side of the sample a workflow is hosted with WorkflowServiceHost and a WorkflowControlEndpoint is added so that clients can perform control operations (Suspend, Start, etc). A user-defined CreationEndpoint is also added to allow the workflow to be created. The service then uses these endpoints to start the workflow in a suspended state and then resume the workflow. The client performs the same operations but from the client code. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] these interfaces see, [Workflow Control Endpoint](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-control-endpoint.md) and [How to: Host a non-service workflow in IIS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-host-a-non-service-workflow-in-iis.md)  \n  \n#### To run the sample  \n  \n1.  Run [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] with administrator privileges.  \n  \n2.  Open the ManagementEndpoint.sln solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n3.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B or select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu.  \n  \n4.  Start the ManagementEndpoint.exe application.  \n  \n5.  Start the Client.exe application.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer.
