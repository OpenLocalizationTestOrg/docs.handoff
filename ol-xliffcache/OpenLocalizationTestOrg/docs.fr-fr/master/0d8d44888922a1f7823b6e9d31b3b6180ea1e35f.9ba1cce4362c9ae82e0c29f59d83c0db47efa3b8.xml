New folders can also be created from within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To select files, instead of folders, use the [OpenFileDialog](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/openfiledialog-component-windows-forms.md) component.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component is displayed at run time using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method. Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.RootFolder%2A> property to determine the top-most folder and any subfolders that will appear within the tree view of the dialog box. Once the dialog box has been shown, you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog.SelectedPath%2A> property to get the path of the folder that was selected.  \n  \n When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FolderBrowserDialog>   \n [How to: Choose Folders with the Windows Forms FolderBrowserDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-choose-folders-with-the-windows-forms-folderbrowserdialog-component.md)   \n [FolderBrowserDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/folderbrowserdialog-component-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,688],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"FolderBrowserDialog Component Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
