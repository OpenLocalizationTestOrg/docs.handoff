This sample shows how to create the appropriate <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> and how to add it to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer>.  \n  \n## Sample details  \n <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> differs from <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> in one important way: <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> includes CLR type information in the serialized XML, whereas <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> does not. Therefore, <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> can be used only if both the serializing and deserializing ends share the same CLR types. However, it is recommended to use <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> because its performance is better than <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer>. You can change the information that is serialized in <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> by adding a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> to it.  \n  \n This sample consists of two projects. The first project uses <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.NetDataContractSerializer> to serialize an object. The second project uses <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> with a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> to provide the same functionality as the first project.  \n  \n The following code example shows the implementation of a custom <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractResolver> named `MyDataContractResolver` that is added to the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> in the DCSwithDCR project.  \n  \n```  \nclass MyDataContractResolver : DataContractResolver  \n{  \n    private XmlDictionary dictionary = new XmlDictionary();  \n  \n    public MyDataContractResolver()  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    // Used at deserialization  \n    // Allows users to map xsi:type name to any Type   \n    public override Type ResolveName(string typeName, string typeNamespace, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver)  \n    {  \n        Type type = knownTypeResolver.ResolveName(typeName, typeNamespace, null);  \n        if (type == null)  \n        {  \n            type = Type.GetType(typeName + \", \" + typeNamespace);  \n        }  \n        return type;  \n    }  \n  \n    // Used at serialization  \n    // Maps any Type to a new xsi:type representation  \n    public override void ResolveType(Type dataContractType, DataContractResolver knownTypeResolver, out XmlDictionaryString typeName, out XmlDictionaryString typeNamespace)  \n    {  \n        knownTypeResolver.ResolveType(dataContractType, null, out typeName, out typeNamespace);  \n        if (typeName == null || typeNamespace == null)  \n        {  \n            XmlDictionary dictionary = new XmlDictionary();  \n            typeName = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.FullName);  \n            typeNamespace = dictionary.Add(dataContractType.Assembly.FullName);  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.  Using [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)], open the DCRSample.sln solution file.  \n  \n2.  Right-click the solution file and choose **Properties**.  \n  \n3.  In the **Solution Property Pages** dialog, under **Common Properties**, **Startup Project**, select **Multiple startup projects:**.  \n  \n4.  Next to the **DCSwithDCR** project, select **Start** from the **Action** dropdown.  \n  \n5.  Next to the **NetDCS** project, select **Start** from the **Action** dropdown.  \n  \n6.  Click **OK** to close the dialog.  \n  \n7.  To build the solution, press CTRL+SHIFT+B.  \n  \n8.  To run the solution, press CTRL+F5.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
