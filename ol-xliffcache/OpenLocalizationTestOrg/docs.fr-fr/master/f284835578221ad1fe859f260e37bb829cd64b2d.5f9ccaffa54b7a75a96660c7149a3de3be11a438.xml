To implement virtual mode, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.VirtualMode%2A> property to `true` and handle one or more of the events described in this topic. You will typically handle at least the `CellValueNeeded` event, which enables the control look up values in the data cache.  \n  \n## Bound Mode and Virtual Mode  \n Virtual mode is necessary only when you need to supplement or replace bound mode. In bound mode, you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.DataSource%2A> property and the control automatically loads the data from the specified source and submits user changes back to it. You can control which of the bound columns are displayed, and the data source itself typically handles operations such as sorting.  \n  \n## Supplementing Bound Mode  \n You can supplement bound mode by displaying unbound columns along with the bound columns. This is sometimes called \"mixed mode\" and is useful for displaying things like calculated values or user-interface (UI) controls.  \n  \n Because unbound columns are outside the data source, they are ignored by the data source's sorting operations. Therefore, when you enable sorting in mixed mode, you must manage the unbound data in a local cache and implement virtual mode to let the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control interact with it.  \n  \n For more information about using virtual mode to maintain the values in unbound columns, see the examples in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn.ThreeState%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> property and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewComboBoxColumn?displayProperty=nameWithType> class reference topics.  \n  \n## Replacing Bound Mode  \n If bound mode does not meet your performance needs, you can manage all your data in a custom cache through virtual-mode event handlers. For example, you can use virtual mode to implement a just-in-time data loading mechanism that retrieves only as much data from a networked database as is necessary for optimal performance. This scenario is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data over a slow network connection or with client machines that have a limited amount of RAM or storage space.  \n  \n For more information about using virtual mode in a just-in-time scenario, see [Implementing Virtual Mode with Just-In-Time Data Loading in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](implementing-virtual-mode-jit-data-loading-in-the-datagrid.md).  \n  \n## Virtual-Mode Events  \n If your data is read-only, the `CellValueNeeded` event may be the only event you will need to handle. Additional virtual-mode events let you enable specific functionality like user edits, row addition and deletion, and row-level transactions.  \n  \n Some standard <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> events (such as events that occur when users add or delete rows, or when cell values are edited, parsed, validated, or formatted) are useful in virtual mode, as well. You can also handle events that let you maintain values not typically stored in a bound data source, such as cell ToolTip text, cell and row error text, cell and row shortcut menu data, and row height data.  \n  \n For more information about implementing virtual mode to manage read/write data with a row-level commit scope, see [Walkthrough: Implementing Virtual Mode in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](implementing-virtual-mode-wf-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n For an example that implements virtual mode with a cell-level commit scope, see the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.VirtualMode%2A> property reference topic.  \n  \n The following events occur only when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.VirtualMode%2A> property is set to `true`.  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellValueNeeded>|Used by the control to retrieve a cell value from the data cache for display.
