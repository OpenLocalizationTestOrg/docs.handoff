For example, in a fork/join scenario, you can just create a <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent> that has a signal count of 5, and then start five work items on the thread pool and have each work item call <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent.Signal%2A> when it completes. Each call to <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent.Signal%2A> decrements the signal count by 1. On the main thread, the call to <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent.Wait%2A> will block until the signal count is zero.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For code that does not have to interact with legacy .NET Framework synchronization APIs, consider using <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task?displayProperty=fullName> objects or the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.Invoke%2A> method for an even easier approach to expressing fork-join parallelism.  \n  \n <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent> has these additional features:  \n  \n-   The wait operation can be canceled by using cancellation tokens.  \n  \n-   Its signal count can be incremented after the instance is created.  \n  \n-   Instances can be reused after <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent.Wait%2A> has returned by calling the <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent.Reset%2A> method.  \n  \n-   Instances expose a <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle> for integration with other .NET Framework synchronization APIs such as <xref:System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitAll%2A>.  \n  \n## Basic Usage  \n The following example demonstrates how to use a <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent> with <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> work items.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CDS_CountdownEvent#01](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_countdownevent/cs/countdownevent.cs#01)]\n [!code-vb[CDS_CountdownEvent#01](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_countdownevent/vb/module1.vb#01)]  \n  \n## CountdownEvent With Cancellation  \n The following example shows how to cancel the wait operation on <xref:System.Threading.CountdownEvent> by using a cancellation token. The basic pattern follows the model for unified cancellation, which is introduced in [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)]. For more information, see [Cancellation in Managed Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads.md).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CDS_CountdownEvent#02](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_countdownevent/cs/countdownevent.cs#02)]\n [!code-vb[CDS_CountdownEvent#02](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/cds_countdownevent/vb/canceleventwait.vb#02)]  \n  \n Note that the wait operation does not cancel the threads that are signaling it. Typically, cancellation is applied to a logical operation, and that can include waiting on the event as well as all the work items that the wait is synchronizing. In this example, each work item is passed a copy of the same cancellation token so that it can respond to the cancellation request.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [EventWaitHandle, AutoResetEvent,
