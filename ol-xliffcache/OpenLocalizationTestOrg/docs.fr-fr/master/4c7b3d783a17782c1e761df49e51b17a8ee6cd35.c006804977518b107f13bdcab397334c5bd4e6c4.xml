This operation can be done using a recursive procedure (recursive method in C# and C++) that iterates through each node in each collection of the tree.  \n  \n Each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> object in a tree view has properties that you can use to navigate the tree view: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.FirstNode%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.LastNode%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.NextNode%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.PrevNode%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Parent%2A>. The value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Parent%2A> property is the parent node of the current node. The child nodes of the current node, if there are any, are listed in its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Nodes%2A> property. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control itself has the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.TopNode%2A> property, which is the root node of the entire tree view.  \n  \n### To iterate through all nodes of the TreeView control  \n  \n1.  Create a recursive procedure (recursive method in C# and C++) that tests each node.  \n  \n2.  Call the procedure.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to print each <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> object's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode.Text%2A> property:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintRecursive(ByVal n As TreeNode)  \n       System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(n.Text)  \n       MessageBox.Show(n.Text)  \n       Dim aNode As TreeNode  \n       For Each aNode In n.Nodes  \n          PrintRecursive(aNode)  \n       Next  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ' Call the procedure using the top nodes of the treeview.  \n    Private Sub CallRecursive(ByVal aTreeView As TreeView)  \n       Dim n As TreeNode  \n       For Each n In aTreeView.Nodes  \n          PrintRecursive(n)  \n       Next  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void PrintRecursive(TreeNode treeNode)  \n    {  \n       // Print the node.  \n       System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(treeNode.Text);  \n       MessageBox.Show(treeNode.Text);  \n       // Print each node recursively.  \n       foreach (TreeNode tn in treeNode.Nodes)  \n       {  \n          PrintRecursive(tn);  \n       }  \n    }  \n  \n    // Call the procedure using the TreeView.  \n    private void CallRecursive(TreeView treeView)  \n    {  \n       // Print each node recursively.  \n       TreeNodeCollection nodes = treeView.Nodes;  \n       foreach (TreeNode n in nodes)  \n       {  \n          PrintRecursive(n);  \n       }  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void PrintRecursive( TreeNode^ treeNode )  \n       {  \n          // Print the node.  \n          System::Diagnostics::Debug::WriteLine( treeNode->Text );  \n          MessageBox::Show( treeNode->Text );  \n  \n          // Print each node recursively.  \n          System::Collections::IEnumerator^ myNodes = (safe_cast<System::Collections::IEnumerable^>(treeNode->Nodes))->GetEnumerator();  \n          try  \n          {  \n             while ( myNodes->MoveNext() )  \n             {  \n                TreeNode^ tn = safe_cast<TreeNode^>(myNodes->Current);  \n                PrintRecursive( tn );  \n             }  \n          }  \n          finally  \n          {  \n             IDisposable^ disposable = dynamic_cast<System::IDisposable^>(myNodes);  \n             if ( disposable != nullptr )  \n                      disposable->Dispose();  \n          }  \n       }  \n  \n       // Call the procedure using the TreeView.  \n       void CallRecursive( TreeView^ treeView )  \n       {  \n          // Print each node recursively.  \n          TreeNodeCollection^ nodes = treeView->Nodes;  \n          System::Collections::IEnumerator^ myNodes = (safe_cast<System::Collections::IEnumerable^>(nodes))->GetEnumerator();  \n          try  \n          {  \n             while ( myNodes->MoveNext() )  \n             {  \n                TreeNode^ n = safe_cast<TreeNode^>(myNodes->Current);  \n                PrintRecursive( n );  \n             }  \n          }  \n          finally  \n          {  \n             IDisposable^ disposable = dynamic_cast<System::IDisposable^>(myNodes);  \n             if ( disposable != nullptr )  \n                      disposable->Dispose();  \n          }  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [Recursive Procedures](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/recursive-procedures.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,620],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,86],"content":"How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,86]}]}],"pos":[6,95],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
