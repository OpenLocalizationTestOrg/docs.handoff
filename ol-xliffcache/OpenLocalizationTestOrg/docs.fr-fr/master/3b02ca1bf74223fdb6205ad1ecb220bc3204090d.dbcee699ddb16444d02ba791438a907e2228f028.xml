In both examples, when you create the instance of the <xref:System.IO.StreamReader> class, you provide the relative or absolute path to the file. The following examples assume that the file named TestFile.txt is in the same folder as the application.  \n  \n These code examples do not apply developing for Windows Store Apps because the Windows Runtime provides different streams types reading and writing to files. For an example that shows how to read text from a file within the context of a Windows Store app, see [Quickstart: Reading and writing files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh758325.aspx). For examples that show how to convert between .NET Framework streams and Windows runtime streams see [How to: Convert Between .NET Framework Streams and Windows Runtime Streams](../../../docs/standard/io/how-to-convert-between-dotnet-streams-and-winrt-streams.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The first example shows a synchronous read operation within a console application. In this example, the text file is opened using a stream reader, the contents are copied to a string and string is output to the console.  \n  \n
