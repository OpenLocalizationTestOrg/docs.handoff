Association ends are defined as part of an association; an association must have exactly two association ends. [Navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) allow for navigation from one association end to the other.  \n  \n An association end definition contains the following information:  \n  \n-   One of the entity types involved in the association. (Required)  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  For a given association, the entity type specified for each association end can be the same. This creates a self-association.  \n  \n-   An [association end multiplicity](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-end-multiplicity.md) that indicates the number of entity type instances that can be at one end of the association. An association end multiplicity can have a value of one (1), zero or one (0..1), or many (*).  \n  \n-   A name for the association end. (Optional)  \n  \n-   Information about operations that are performed on the association end, such as cascade on delete. (Optional)  \n  \n## Example  \n The diagram below shows a conceptual model with two associations: `PublishedBy` and `WrittenBy`. The association ends for the `PublishedBy` association are the `Book` and `Publisher` entity types. The multiplicity of the `Publisher` end is one (1) and the multiplicity of the `Book` end is many (*), indicating that a publisher publishes many books and a book is published by one publisher.  \n  \n ![Example Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/media/examplemodel.gif \"ExampleModel\")  \n  \n The ADO.NET Entity Framework uses a domain-specific language (DSL) called conceptual schema definition language ([CSDL](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/csdl-specification.md)) to define conceptual models. The CSDL below defines the `PublishedBy` association shown in the diagram above. Note that the type, name, and multiplicity of each association end are specified by XML attributes (the `Type`, `Role`, and `Multiplicity` attributes, respectively). Optional information about operations performed on an end is specified in an XML element (the `OnDelete` element). In this case, if a publisher is deleted, so are all associated books.  \n  \n [!code-xml[EDM_Example_Model#AssociationEnd](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Data/edm_example_model/xml/books3.edmx#associationend)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity Data Model Key Concepts](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model-key-concepts.md)   \n [Entity Data Model](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-data-model.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,346],"nodes":[{"content":"association end | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"association end | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"association end | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,32]}]}],"pos":[6,41],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"association end | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: 2c345213-0296-4d90-ac6d-cef179798a75\ncaps.latest.revision: 3\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[353,368],"content":"association end","linkify":"association end","nodes":[{"content":"association end","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>association end<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> identifies the <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>entity type<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md)</ept> on one end of an <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>association<ept id=\"p3\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md)</ept> and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association.","pos":[369,650],"source":"An *association end* identifies the [entity type](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md) on one end of an [association](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/association-type.md) and the number of entity type instances that can exist at that end of an association."},{"content":"Association ends are defined as part of an association; an association must have exactly two association ends.","pos":[651,761]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Navigation properties<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md)</ept> allow for navigation from one association end to the other.","pos":[762,908],"source":"[Navigation properties](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/navigation-property.md) allow for navigation from one association end to the other."},{"content":"An association end definition contains the following information:","pos":[915,980]},{"content":"One of the entity types involved in the association.","pos":[990,1042]},{"content":"(Required)","pos":[1043,1053]},{"pos":[1065,1205],"content":"[!NOTE]\nFor a given association, the entity type specified for each association end can be the same.
