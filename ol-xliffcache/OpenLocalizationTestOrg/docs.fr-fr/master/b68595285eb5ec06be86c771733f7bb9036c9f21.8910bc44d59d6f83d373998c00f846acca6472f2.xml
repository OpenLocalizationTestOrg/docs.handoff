You can execute queries by using one of these methods:  \n  \n-   Executing a LINQ query against the named <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> that you obtain from the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> that the `Add Data Service Reference` tool generates.  \n  \n-   Implicitly, by enumerating over the named <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601> that you obtain from the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext> that the `Add Data Service Reference` tool generates.  \n  \n-   Explicitly, by calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceContext.Execute%2A> method on the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601>, or the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A> method for asynchronous execution.  \n  \n For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to define and execute a LINQ query that returns all `Customers` against the Northwind data service.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#GetAllCustomersLinq](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#getallcustomerslinq)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#GetAllCustomersLinq](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#getallcustomerslinq)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use the context that the `Add Data Service Reference` tool generates to implicitly execute a query that returns all `Customers` against the Northwind data service. The URI of the requested `Customers` entity set is determined automatically by the context. The query is executed implicitly when the enumeration occurs.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#GetAllCustomers](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind
