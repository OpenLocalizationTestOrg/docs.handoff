When you use <xref:System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions> methods in LINQ to Entities queries, the corresponding database functions are executed in the database.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Database functions that perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value (also known as aggregate database functions) can be directly invoked. Other canonical functions can only be called as part of a LINQ to Entities query. To call an aggregate function directly, you must pass an <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601> to the function. For more information, see the second example below.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The methods in the <xref:System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions> class are specific to SQL Server functions. Similar classes that expose database functions may be available through other providers.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=msftdbprodsamples). The example executes a LINQ to Entities query that uses the <xref:System.Data.Objects.SqlClient.SqlFunctions.CharIndex%2A> method to return all contacts whose last name starts with \"Si\":  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP L2E CanonicalAndStoreFunctions#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp l2e canonicalandstorefunctions/cs/program.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[DP L2E CanonicalAndStoreFunctions#3](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/dp l2e canonicalandstorefunctions/vb/module1.vb#3)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example uses the [AdventureWorks Sales Model](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=msftdbprodsamples).
