This can prevent the preparation of some run-time resources ahead of time.  \n  \n In particular, methods with generic type variables can lazily allocate resources in the background. These are referred to as generic dictionary entries. For instance, for the statement `List<T> list = new List<T>();` where `T` is a generic type variable the runtime must look up and possibly create the exact instantiation at run time, for example, `List<Object>, List<String>`,and so forth. This can fail for a variety of reasons beyond the developer's control, such as running out of memory.  \n  \n This MDA should only be activated at JIT-compilation time, not when there is an exact instantiation.  \n  \n When this MDA is activated, the likely symptoms are that CERs are not functional for the bad instantiations. In fact, the runtime has not attempted to implement a CER under the circumstances that caused the MDA to be activated. So if the developer uses a shared instantiation of the CER, then JIT-compilation errors, generics type loading errors, or thread aborts within the region of the intended CER are not caught.  \n  \n## Resolution  \n Do not use generic type variables that are of object reference type for methods that may contain a CER.  \n  \n## Effect on the Runtime  \n This MDA has no effect on the CLR.  \n  \n## Output  \n The following is a sample of output from this MDA.  \n  \n `Method 'GenericMethodWithCer', which contains at least one constrained execution region, cannot be prepared automatically since it has one or more unbound generic type parameters.`  \n  \n `The caller must ensure this method is prepared explicitly at run time prior to execution.`  \n  \n `method name=\"GenericMethodWithCer\"`  \n  \n `declaringType name=\"OpenGenericCERCall\"`  \n  \n## Configuration  \n  \n```  \n<mdaConfig>  \n  <assistants>  \n    <openGenericCERCall/>  \n  </assistants>  \n</mdaConfig>  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The CER code is not executed.  \n  \n```  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;  \n  \nclass Program  \n{  \n    static void Main(string[] args)  \n    {  \n        CallGenericMethods();  \n    }  \n    static void CallGenericMethods()  \n    {  \n        // This call is correct. The instantiation of the method  \n        // contains only nonreference types.  \n        MyClass.GenericMethodWithCer<int>();  \n  \n        // This call is incorrect.
