A class or struct may have multiple constructors that take different arguments. Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read. For more information and examples, see [Using Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors.md) and [Instance Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors.md).  \n\n## Default constructors\n  \nIf you don't provide a constructor for your class, C# creates one by default that instantiates the object and sets member variables to the default values as listed in the [Default Values Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/default-values-table.md). If you don't provide a constructor for your struct, C# replies on an *implicit default constructor* to automatically initialize each field of a value type to its default value as listed in the [Default Values Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/default-values-table.md). For more information and examples, see [Instance Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors.md).  \n\n## Constructor syntax\n\nA constructor is a method whose name is the same as the name of its type. Its method signature includes only the method name and its parameter list; it does not include a return type. The following example shows the constructor for a class named `Person`.\n\n[!code-cs[constructors](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors1.cs#1)]  \n\nIf a constructor can be implemented as a single statement, you can use an [expression body definition](../statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members.md). The following example defines a `Location` class whose constructor has a single string parameter named *name*. The expression body definition assigns the argument to the `Name` property.\n\n[!code-cs[expression-bodied-constructor](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/expr-bodied-ctor.cs#1)]  \n\n## Static constructors\n\nThe previous examples have all shown instance constructors, which create a new object. A class or struct can also have a static constructor, which initializes static members of the type.  Static constructors are parameterless. If you don't provide a static constructor to initialize static fields, the C# compiler will supply a default static constructor that initializes fields to their default value as listed in the [Default Values Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/default-values-table.md). \n\nThe following example uses a static constructor to initialize a static field.\n\n[!code-cs[constructors](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors1.cs#2)]  \n\nYou can also define a static constructor with an expression body definition, as the following example shows. \n\n[!code-cs[constructors](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors1.cs#3)]  \n\nFor more information and examples, see [Static Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-constructors.md).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Using Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/using-constructors.md)  \n  \n [Instance Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors.md)  \n  \n [Private Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/private-constructors.md)  \n  \n [Static Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/static-constructors.md)  \n  \n [How to: Write a Copy Constructor](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/how-to-write-a-copy-constructor.md)  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)   \n [Finalizers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/destructors.md)   \n [static](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/static.md)   \n [Why Do Initializers Run In The Opposite Order As Constructors?
