This tool retrieves metadata from a web service in the current solution, on a network location, or from a WSDL file, and generates a source file compatible with .NET Core, defining a WCF proxy class with methods that you can use to access the web service operations.\n\n## [WCF dotnet-svcutil tool](dotnet-svcutil-guide.md)\n\nThe WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) dotnet-svcutil tool is a .NET Core CLI tool that retrieves metadata from a web service on a network location or from a WSDL file, and generates a source file compatible with .NET Core, defining a WCF proxy class with methods that you can use to access the web service operations.\nThe **dotnet-svcutil** tool is an alternative option to the [**WCF Web Service Reference**](wcf-web-service-reference-guide.md) Visual Studio connected service provider which first shipped with Visual Studio 2017 v15.5. The **dotnet-svcutil** tool as a .NET Core CLI tool, is available cross-platform on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n## [WCF dotnet-svcutil.xmlserializer tool](dotnet-svcutil.xmlserializer-guide.md)\n\nOn the .NET Framework, you can pre-generate a serialization assembly using the svcutil tool. The dotnet-svcutil.xmlserializer NuGet package provides similar functionality on .NET Core. It pre-generates C# serialization code for the types in the client application that are used by the WCF Service Contract and that can be serialized by the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>. This improves the startup performance of XML serialization when serializing or deserializing objects of those types.\n\n## [XML Serializer Generator](xml-serializer-generator.md)\n\nLike the [Xml Serializer Generator (sgen.exe)](../../standard/serialization/xml-serializer-generator-tool-sgen-exe.md) for the .NET Framework, the [Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.XmlSerializer.Generator) is the solution for .NET Core and .NET Standard libraries. It creates an XML serialization assembly for types contained in an assembly to improve the startup performance of XML serialization when serializing or de-serializing objects of those types using <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer>.","nodes":[{"pos":[4,221],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: .NET Core additional CLI tools\ndescription: An overview of the additional
