Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. LINQ makes a *query* a first-class language construct in C#. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators.  \n  \n You can write LINQ queries in C# for SQL Server databases, XML documents, ADO.NET Datasets, and any collection of objects that supports <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable> or the generic <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> interface. LINQ support is also provided by third parties for many Web services and other database implementations.  \n  \n You can use LINQ queries in new projects, or alongside non-LINQ queries in existing projects. The only requirement is that the project target .NET Framework 3.5 or later.  \n  \n The following illustration from Visual Studio shows a partially-completed LINQ query against a SQL Server database in both C# and Visual Basic with full type checking and IntelliSense support.  \n  \n ![LINQ query with Intellisense](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/media/query_intell.png \"Query_Intell\")  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n To learn more details about LINQ, start by becoming familiar with some basic concepts in the Getting Started section [Getting Started with LINQ in C#](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/getting-started-with-linq.md), and then read the documentation for the LINQ technology in which you are interested:  \n  \n-   SQL Server
