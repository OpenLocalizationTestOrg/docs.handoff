An expression that represents a condition to test elements for. The expression must return a `Boolean` value or a functional equivalent, such as an `Integer` to be evaluated as a `Boolean`.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `Skip While` clause bypasses elements from the beginning of a query result until the supplied `expression` returns `false`. After `expression` returns `false`, the query returns all the remaining elements. The `expression` is ignored for the remaining results.  \n  \n The `Skip While` clause differs from the `Where` clause in that the `Where` clause can be used to exclude all elements from a query that do not meet a particular condition. The `Skip While` clause excludes elements only until the first time that the condition is not satisfied. The `Skip While` clause is most useful when you are working with an ordered query result.  \n  \n You can bypass a specific number of results from the beginning of a query result by using the `Skip` clause.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example uses the `Skip While` clause to bypass results until the first customer from the United States is found.  \n  \n
