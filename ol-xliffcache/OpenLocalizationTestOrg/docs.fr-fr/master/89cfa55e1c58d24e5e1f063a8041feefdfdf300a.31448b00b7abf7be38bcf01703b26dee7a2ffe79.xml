The data type of the property is inferred from the value assigned to it. For example, the following declarations are not valid.  \n  \n```vb  \n'' Not valid.  \n'Dim anon1 = New With {.ID$ = \"abc\"}  \n'Dim anon2 = New With {.ID$ = 42}  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36560  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the type character from the initializer list. You can explicitly convert the assigned value if this is necessary to establish the data type you want for the property.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Valid.  \nDim anon1 = New With {.ID = \"abc\"}  \nDim anon2 = New With {.ID = CStr(42)}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)\n- [How to: Infer Property Names and Types in Anonymous Type Declarations](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations.md)\n- [Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,222],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc36560\"\n  - \"vbc36560\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36560\"\nms.assetid: 70eee559-d6fc-409b-b835-2c84511b160e","nodes":[{"content":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","nodes":[{"content":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[229,290],"content":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","linkify":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","nodes":[{"content":"Type characters cannot be used in anonymous type declarations","pos":[0,61]}]},{"content":"You cannot use a type character on a property name when you declare an instance of an anonymous type.","pos":[291,392]},{"content":"The data type of the property is inferred from the value assigned to it.","pos":[393,465]},{"content":"For example, the following declarations are not valid.","pos":[466,520]},{"pos":[635,656],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36560","source":"**Error ID:** BC36560"},{"pos":[665,686],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the type character from the initializer list.","pos":[696,748]},{"content":"You can explicitly convert the assigned value if this is necessary to establish the data type you want for the property.","pos":[749,869]},{"pos":[983,991],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[995,1107],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Anonymous Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Anonymous Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)"},{"pos":[1110,1329],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Infer Property Names and Types in Anonymous Type Declarations<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Infer Property Names and Types in Anonymous Type Declarations](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/how-to-infer-property-names-and-types-in-anonymous-type-declarations.md)"},{"pos":[1332,1471],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Implicit and Explicit Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)</ept>","source":"[Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)"}]}
