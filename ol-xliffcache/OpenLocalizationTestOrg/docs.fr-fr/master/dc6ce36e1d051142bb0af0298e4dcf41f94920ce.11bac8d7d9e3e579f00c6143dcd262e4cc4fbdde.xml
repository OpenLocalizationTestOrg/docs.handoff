One way to limit this problem is to use a \"bitblt\" process on the graphic. Bitblt is the \"bit-block transfer\" of the color data from an origin rectangle of pixels to a destination rectangle of pixels.  \n  \n With Windows Forms, bitblt is accomplished using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class. In the parameters of the method, you specify the source and destination (as points), the size of the area to be copied, and the graphics object used to draw the new shape.  \n  \n In the example below, a shape is drawn on the form in its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler. Then, the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method is used to duplicate the shape.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Setting the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleBuffered%2A> property to `true` will make graphics-based code in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event be double-buffered. While this will not have any discernable performance gains when using the code below, it is something to keep in mind when working with more complex graphics-manipulation code.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate Sub Form1_Paint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As _  \n    System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Handles MyBase.Paint  \n    ' Draw a circle with a bar on top.  \n        e.Graphics.FillEllipse(Brushes.DarkBlue, New Rectangle _  \n             (10, 10, 60, 60))  \n        e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Khaki, New Rectangle _  \n             (20, 30, 60, 10))  \n    ' Copy the graphic to a new location.  \n        e.Graphics.CopyFromScreen(New Point(10, 10), New Point _  \n             (100, 100), New Size(70, 70))  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nprivate void Form1_Paint(System.Object sender,  \n    System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs e)  \n        {  \n        e.Graphics.FillEllipse(Brushes.DarkBlue, new  \n            Rectangle(10,10,60,60));  \n        e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Khaki, new  \n            Rectangle(20,30,60,10));  \n        e.Graphics.CopyFromScreen(new Point(10, 10), new Point(100, 100),   \n            new Size(70, 70));  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The code above is run in the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler so that the graphics persist when the form is redrawn. As such, do not call graphics-related methods in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler, because the drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.CopyPixelOperation>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillRectangle%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)   \n [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,86],"content":"How to: Copy Pixels for Reducing Flicker in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Copy Pixels for Reducing Flicker in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,74]}]},{"pos":[618,675],"content":"How to: Copy Pixels for Reducing Flicker in Windows Forms","linkify":"How to: Copy Pixels for Reducing Flicker in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Copy Pixels for Reducing Flicker in Windows Forms","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"When you animate a simple graphic, users can sometimes encounter flicker or other undesirable visual effects.","pos":[676,785]},{"content":"One way to limit this problem is to use a \"bitblt\" process on the graphic.","pos":[786,860]},{"content":"Bitblt is the \"bit-block transfer\" of the color data from an origin rectangle of pixels to a destination rectangle of pixels.","pos":[861,986]},{"content":"With Windows Forms, bitblt is accomplished using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[993,1146],"source":"With Windows Forms, bitblt is accomplished using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"content":"In the parameters of the method, you specify the source and destination (as points), the size of the area to be copied, and the graphics object used to draw the new shape.","pos":[1147,1318]},{"content":"In the example below, a shape is drawn on the form in its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint&gt;</ph> event handler.","pos":[1325,1439],"source":"In the example below, a shape is drawn on the form in its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler."},{"content":"Then, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A&gt;</ph> method is used to duplicate the shape.","pos":[1440,1537],"source":" Then, the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method is used to duplicate the shape."},{"pos":[1545,1929],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Setting the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleBuffered%2A> property to `true` will make graphics-based code in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event be double-buffered.
