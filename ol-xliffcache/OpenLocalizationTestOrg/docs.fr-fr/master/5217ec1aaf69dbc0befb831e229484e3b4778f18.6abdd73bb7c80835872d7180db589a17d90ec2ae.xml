The following illustration shows the string \"Hello\" clipped to a heart-shaped region.  \n  \n ![Restricted Drawing Surface](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art30.gif \"AboutGdip02_Art30\")  \n  \n## Clipping with Regions  \n Regions can be constructed from paths, and paths can contain the outlines of strings, so you can use outlined text for clipping.
