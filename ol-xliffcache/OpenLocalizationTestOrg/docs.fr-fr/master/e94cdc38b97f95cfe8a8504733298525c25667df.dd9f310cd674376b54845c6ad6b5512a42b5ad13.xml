Or, you may want to create a basic form with settings such as a watermark or certain control layout that you will then use again within a project, with each iteration containing modifications to the original form template. Form inheritance enables you to create a base form and then inherit from it and make modifications while preserving whatever original settings you need.  \n  \n You can create derived-class forms programmatically or by using the Visual Inheritance picker.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Inherit Windows Forms](how-to-inherit-windows-forms.md)  \n Gives directions for creating inherited forms in code.  \n  \n [How to: Inherit Forms Using the Inheritance Picker Dialog Box](how-to-inherit-forms-using-the-inheritance-picker-dialog-box.md)  \n Gives directions for creating inherited forms with the Inheritance Picker.  \n  \n [Effects of Modifying a Base Form's Appearance](effects-of-modifying-base-form-appearance.md)  \n Gives directions for changing a base form's controls and their properties.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Demonstrating Visual Inheritance](walkthrough-demonstrating-visual-inheritance.md)  \n Describes how to create a base Windows Form and compile it into a class library. You will import this class library into another project, and create a new form that inherits from the base form.  \n  \n [How to: Use the Modifiers and GenerateMember Properties](how-to-use-the-modifiers-and-generatemember-properties.md)  \n Gives directions for using the `GenerateMember` and `Modifiers` properties, which are relevant when the Windows Forms Designer generates a member variable for a component.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)  \n Describes how to define Visual Basic classes that serve as the basis for other classes.  \n  \n [class](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class.md)  \n Describes the C# approach of classes, in which single inheritance is allowed.  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Inherited Event Handlers in Visual Basic](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/events/troubleshooting-inherited-event-handlers.md)  \n Lists common issues that arise with event handlers in inherited
