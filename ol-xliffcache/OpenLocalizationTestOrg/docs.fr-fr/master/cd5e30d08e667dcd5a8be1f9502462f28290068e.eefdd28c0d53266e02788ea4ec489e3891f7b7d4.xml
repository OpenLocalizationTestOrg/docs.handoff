A debugger may also wish to hide this thread from the user. If no helper thread exists in the process yet, the `GetHelperThreadID` method returns zero in *`pThreadID`.  \n  \n You cannot cache the thread ID of the helper thread, because it may change over time. You must re-query the thread ID at every stopping event.  \n  \n The thread ID of the debugger's helper thread will be correct on every unmanaged [ICorDebugManagedCallback::CreateThread](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugmanagedcallback-createthread-method.md) event, thus allowing a debugger to determine the thread ID of its helper thread and hide it from the user. A thread that is identified as a helper thread during an unmanaged `ICorDebugManagedCallback::CreateThread` event will never run managed user code.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl.
