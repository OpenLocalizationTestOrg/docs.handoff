Use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A> properties to set its start point; and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A> properties to set its end point. Finally, set its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> because a line without a stroke is invisible.  \n  \n Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior.  \n  \n The following example draws three lines inside a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>element.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xml[drawingwithshapeelements#LineExample1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/lineexample.xaml#lineexample1)]  \n  \n This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>   \n [Shape Elements Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,440],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Line | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-wpf\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"drawing, lines\"\n  - \"graphics [WPF], lines\"\n  - \"lines, drawing\"\nms.assetid: 0513ee01-6b27-4bb3-85f3-3a3e6710d80e\ncaps.latest.revision: 7\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"How to: Draw a Line | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[447,466],"content":"How to: Draw a Line","linkify":"How to: Draw a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line","pos":[0,19]}]},{"content":"This example shows you how to draw lines by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[467,563],"source":"This example shows you how to draw lines by using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> element."},{"content":"To draw a line, create a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[570,637],"source":"To draw a line, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> element."},{"content":"Use its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A&gt;</ph> properties to set its start point; and use its <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A&gt;</ph> properties to set its end point.","pos":[638,893],"source":" Use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A> properties to set its start point; and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A> properties to set its end point."},{"content":"Finally, set its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A&gt;</ph> because a line without a stroke is invisible.","pos":[894,1059],"source":" Finally, set its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> because a line without a stroke is invisible."},{"content":"Setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A&gt;</ph> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior.","pos":[1066,1186],"source":"Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior."},{"content":"The following example draws three lines inside a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas&gt;</ph>element.","pos":[1193,1287],"source":"The following example draws three lines inside a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>element."},{"pos":[1296,1303],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1475,1616],"content":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>.","source":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)."},{"pos":[1625,1633],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph>","pos":[1637,1670],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>","pos":[1675,1745],"source":"[Shape Elements Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)"}]}
