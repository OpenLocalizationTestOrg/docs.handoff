It can be used in conjunction with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component to be in command of all aspects of document printing.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PrintDocument Component Overview](printdocument-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintDocument` component, which allows you to set properties describing what to print and launches printing in a Windows-based application.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Windows Forms Print Support](../advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)  \n Presents a list of printing topics related to Windows Forms.  \n  \n [PrintDialog Component](printdialog-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings.  \n  \n [PrintPreviewControl Control](printpreviewcontrol-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl>, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog box or component.  \n  \n [PrintPreviewDialog Control](printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to see a version of their document as it will look when it prints.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,233],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"PrintDocument Component (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
