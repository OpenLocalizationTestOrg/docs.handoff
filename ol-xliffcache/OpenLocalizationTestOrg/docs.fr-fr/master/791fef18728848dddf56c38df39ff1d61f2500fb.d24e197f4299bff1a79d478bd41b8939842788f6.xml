The reply must be sent and correlated to the request under the terms of this contract. Even if the method returns no reply (`void` in C#, or a `Sub` in Visual Basic), the infrastructure creates and sends an empty message to the caller. To prevent the sending of an empty reply message, use a one-way contract for the operation.  \n  \n### To create a request-reply contract  \n  \n1.  Create an interface in the programming language of your choice.  \n  \n2.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute to the interface.  \n  \n3.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute to each method that clients can invoke.  \n  \n4.  Optional. Set the value of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property to `true` to prevent the sending of an empty reply message. By default, all operations are request-reply contracts.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample defines a contract for a calculator service that provides `Add` and `Subtract` methods. The `Multiply` method is not part of the contract because it is not marked by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class and so it is not accessible to clients.  \n  \n```  \nusing System.ServiceModel;   \n  \n[ServiceContract]   \npublic interface ICalculator   \n{   \n[OperationContract]   \n// It would be equivalent to write explicitly:  \n// [OperationContract(IsOneWay=false)]   \nint Add(int a, int b);   \n  \n[OperationContract]   \nint Subtract(int a, int b);   \n  \nint Multiply(int a, int b)  \n}  \n```  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how to specify operation contracts, see the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.IsOneWay%2A> property.  \n  \n-   Applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attributes causes the automatic generation of service contract definitions in a Web Services Description Language (WSDL) document once the service is deployed. The document is downloaded by appending `?wsdl` to the HTTP base address for the service. For example, `http://microsoft/CalculatorService?wsdl`  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute>   \n [Designing Service
