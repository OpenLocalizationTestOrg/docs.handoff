The service exposes one operation that takes a string argument and echoes the input back to the client. The sample shows how to set up the parameters for these messaging activities.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples. This sample is located in the following directory.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples\\WF\\Basic\\Services\\SendReceiveParameters`  \n  \n#### Using this sample  \n  \n1.  Load the project solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] and build the project.  \n  \n2.  First run the EchoWorkflowService application generated in [solution base directory]\\EchoWorkflowService\\bin\\debug.  \n  \n3.  Second, run the EchoWorkflowClient application generated in [solution base directory]\\EchoWorkflowClient\\bin\\debug.  \n  \n4.  The client calls Echo operation on the service and prints the results. When complete, press ENTER to exit the client and then the service.  \n  \n## See Also","nodes":[{"pos":[12,91],"content":"Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,79]}]},{"pos":[356,418],"content":"Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities","linkify":"Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities","nodes":[{"content":"Basic Usage of SendParameters and ReceiveParameters Activities","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"This sample shows the use of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendParametersContent&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParametersContent&gt;</ph> activities.","pos":[419,586],"source":"This sample shows the use of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.SendParametersContent> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.ReceiveParametersContent> activities."},{"content":"The service exposes one operation that takes a string argument and echoes the input back to the client.","pos":[587,690]},{"content":"The sample shows how to set up the parameters for these messaging activities.","pos":[691,768]},{"pos":[776,908],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The samples may already be installed on your machine.
