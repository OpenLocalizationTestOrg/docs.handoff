This topic shows how to stream fragments using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>.  \n  \n One of the most effective ways to use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to read <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> objects is to write your own custom axis method. An axis method typically returns a collection such as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%601> of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, as shown in the example in this topic. In the custom axis method, after you create the XML fragment by calling the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom%2A> method, return the collection using `yield return`. This provides deferred execution semantics to your custom axis method.  \n  \n When you create an XML tree from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> object, the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> must be positioned on an element. The <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom%2A> method does not return until it has read the close tag of the element.  \n  \n If you want to create a partial tree, you can instantiate an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>, position the reader on the node that you want to convert to an <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> tree, and then create the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> object.  \n  \n The topic [How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information.md) contains information and an example on how to stream a more complex document.  \n  \n The topic [How to: Perform Streaming Transform of Large XML Documents (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-perform-streaming-transform-of-large-xml-documents.md) contains an example of using LINQ to XML to transform extremely large XML documents while maintaining a small memory footprint.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example creates a custom axis method. You can query it by using a [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query. The custom axis method, `StreamRootChildDoc`, is a method that is designed specifically to read a document that has a repeating `Child` element.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic IEnumerable<XElement> StreamRootChildDoc(StringReader stringReader)  \n{  \n    using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(stringReader))  \n    {  \n        reader.MoveToContent();  \n        // Parse the file and display each of the nodes.  \n        while (reader.Read())  \n        {  \n            switch (reader.NodeType)  \n            {  \n                case XmlNodeType.Element:  \n                    if (reader.Name == \"Child\") {  \n                        XElement el = XElement.ReadFrom(reader) as XElement;  \n                        if (el != null)  \n                            yield return el;  \n                    }  \n                    break;  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nstatic void Main(string[] args)  \n{  \n    string markup = @\"<Root>  \n      <Child Key=\"\"01\"\">  \n        <GrandChild>aaa</GrandChild>  \n      </Child>  \n      <Child Key=\"\"02\"\">  \n        <GrandChild>bbb</GrandChild>  \n      </Child>  \n      <Child Key=\"\"03\"\">  \n        <GrandChild>ccc</GrandChild>  \n      </Child>  \n    </Root>\";  \n  \n    IEnumerable<string> grandChildData =  \n        from el in StreamRootChildDoc(new StringReader(markup))  \n        where (int)el.Attribute(\"Key\") > 1  \n        select (string)el.Element(\"GrandChild\");  \n  \n    foreach (string str in grandChildData) {  \n        Console.WriteLine(str);  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```  \nbbb  \nccc  \n```  \n  \n In this example, the source document is very small. However, even if there were millions of `Child` elements, this example would still have a small memory footprint.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Parsing XML
