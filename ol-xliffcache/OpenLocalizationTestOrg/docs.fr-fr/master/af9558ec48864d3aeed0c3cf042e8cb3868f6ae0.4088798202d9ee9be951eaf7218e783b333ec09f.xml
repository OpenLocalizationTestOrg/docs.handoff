This sample shows how to build an activity designer that surfaces such a \"drop zone.\"  \n  \n This sample demonstrates:  \n  \n## Demonstrates  \n  \n-   Creating a custom activity designer with a <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowItemPresenter>.  \n  \n-   Registering the custom designer using the metadata store.  \n  \n-   Programming the rehosted toolbox declaratively and imperatively.  \n  \n## Sample Details  \n The code for this sample shows:  \n  \n-   The custom activity designer is built for the `SimpleNativeActivity` class.  \n  \n-   The creation of a custom activity designer with a <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.WorkflowItemPresenter>.  \n  \n```xaml  \n<sap:ActivityDesigner x:Class=\"Microsoft.Samples.UsingWorkflowItemPresenter.SimpleNativeDesigner\"  \n    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"  \n    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"  \n    xmlns:sap=\"clr-namespace:System.Activities.Presentation;assembly=System.Activities.Presentation\"  \n    xmlns:sapv=\"clr-namespace:System.Activities.Presentation.View;assembly=System.Activities.Presentation\">  \n    <sap:ActivityDesigner.Resources>  \n        <DataTemplate x:Key=\"Collapsed\">  \n            <StackPanel>  \n                <TextBlock>This is the collapsed view</TextBlock>  \n            </StackPanel>  \n        </DataTemplate>  \n        <DataTemplate x:Key=\"Expanded\">  \n            <StackPanel>  \n                <TextBlock>Custom Text</TextBlock>  \n                <sap:WorkflowItemPresenter Item=\"{Binding Path=ModelItem.Body, Mode=TwoWay}\"  \n                                        HintText=\"Please drop an activity here\" />  \n            </StackPanel>  \n        </DataTemplate>  \n        <Style x:Key=\"ExpandOrCollapsedStyle\" TargetType=\"{x:Type ContentPresenter}\">  \n            <Setter Property=\"ContentTemplate\" Value=\"{DynamicResource Collapsed}\"/>  \n            <Style.Triggers>  \n                <DataTrigger Binding=\"{Binding Path=ShowExpanded}\" Value=\"true\">  \n                    <Setter Property=\"ContentTemplate\" Value=\"{DynamicResource Expanded}\"/>  \n                </DataTrigger>  \n            </Style.Triggers>  \n        </Style>  \n    </sap:ActivityDesigner.Resources>  \n    <Grid>  \n        <ContentPresenter Style=\"{DynamicResource ExpandOrCollapsedStyle}\" Content=\"{Binding}\" />  \n    </Grid>  \n</sap:ActivityDesigner>  \n```  \n  \n Note the use of WPF data binding to bind to `ModelItem.Body`. `ModelItem` is the property on <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ActivityDesigner> that refers to the underlying object the designer is being used for, in this case, **SimpleNativeActivity**.  \n  \n#### To setup, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.
