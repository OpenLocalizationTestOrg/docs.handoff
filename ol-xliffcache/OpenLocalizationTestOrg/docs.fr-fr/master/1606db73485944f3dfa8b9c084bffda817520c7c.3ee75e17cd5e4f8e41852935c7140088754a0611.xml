The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar> control has two parts: the thumb, also known as a slider, and the tick marks. The thumb is the part that can be adjusted. Its position corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Value%2A> property. The tick marks are visual indicators that are spaced at regular intervals. The trackbar moves in increments that you specify and can be aligned horizontally or vertically. For example, you might use the track bar to control the cursor blink rate or mouse speed for a system.  \n  \n## Key Properties  \n The key properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar> control are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Value%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.TickFrequency%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Minimum%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Maximum%2A>. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.TickFrequency%2A> is the spacing of the ticks. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Minimum%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Maximum%2A> are the smallest and largest values that can be represented on the track bar.  \n  \n Two other important properties are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.SmallChange%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.LargeChange%2A>. The value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.SmallChange%2A> property is the number of positions the thumb moves in response to having the LEFT or RIGHT ARROW key pressed. The value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.LargeChange%2A> property is the number of positions the thumb moves in response to having the PAGE UP or PAGE DOWN key pressed, or in response to mouse clicks on the track bar on either side of the thumb.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar>\n- [TrackBar
