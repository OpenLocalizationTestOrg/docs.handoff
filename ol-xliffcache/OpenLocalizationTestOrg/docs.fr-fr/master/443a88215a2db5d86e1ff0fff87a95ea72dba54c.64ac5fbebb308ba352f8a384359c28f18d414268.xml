The type must be qualified by a namespace.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A collection of objects that are of type `test_type`, or a base type or derived type of `test_type`. If ONLY is specified, only instances of the `test_type` or an empty collection will be returned.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n An `OFTYPE` expression specifies a type expression that is issued to perform a type test against each element of a collection.  The `OFTYPE` expression produces a new collection of the specified type containing only those elements that were either equivalent to that type or a sub-type of it.  \n  \n An `OFTYPE` expression is an abbreviation of the following query expression:  \n  \n```  \nselect value treat(t as T) from ts as t where t is of (T)  \n```  \n  \n Given that a Manager is a subtype of Employee, the following expression produces a collection of only managers from a collection of employees:  \n  \n```  \nOfType(employees, NamespaceName.Manager)  \n```  \n  \n It is also possible to up cast a collection using the type filter:  \n  \n```  \nOfType(executives, NamespaceName.Manager)  \n```  \n  \n Since all executives are managers, the resulting collection still contains all the original executives, though the collection is now typed as a collection of managers.  \n  \n The following table shows the behavior of the `OFTYPE` operator over some patterns. All exceptions are thrown from the client side before the provider is invoked:  \n  \n|Pattern|Behavior|  \n|-------------|--------------|  \n|OFTYPE(Collection(EntityType), EntityType)|Collection(EntityType)|  \n|OFTYPE(Collection(ComplexType), ComplexType)|Throws|  \n|OFTYPE(Collection(RowType), RowType)|Throws|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query uses the OFTYPE operator to return a collection of OnsiteCourse objects from a collection of Course objects. The query is based on the [School Model](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/859a9587-81ea-4a45-9bc0-f8d330e1adac).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts
