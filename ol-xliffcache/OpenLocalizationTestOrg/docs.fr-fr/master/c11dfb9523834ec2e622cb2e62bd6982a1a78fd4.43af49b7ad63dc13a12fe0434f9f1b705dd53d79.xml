Use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A> properties to set its start point; and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A> properties to set its end point. Finally, set its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> because a line without a stroke is invisible.  \n  \n Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior.  \n  \n The following example draws three lines inside a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> element.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[drawingwithshapeelements#LineExample1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/DrawingWithShapeElements/CS/lineexample.xaml#lineexample1)]  \n  \n This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line>\n- [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,207],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Line\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"drawing [WPF], lines\"\n  - \"graphics [WPF], lines\"\n  - \"lines [WPF], drawing\"\nms.assetid: 0513ee01-6b27-4bb3-85f3-3a3e6710d80e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line","nodes":[{"pos":[0,19],"content":"How to: Draw a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line","pos":[0,19]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[214,233],"content":"How to: Draw a Line","linkify":"How to: Draw a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw a Line","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[234,330],"content":"This example shows you how to draw lines by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph> element.","source":"This example shows you how to draw lines by using the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> element."},{"content":"To draw a line, create a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line&gt;</ph> element.","pos":[337,404],"source":"To draw a line, create a <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line> element."},{"content":"Use its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A&gt;</ph> properties to set its start point; and use its <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A&gt;</ph> properties to set its end point.","pos":[405,660],"source":" Use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X1%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y1%2A> properties to set its start point; and use its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.X2%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Line.Y2%2A> properties to set its end point."},{"content":"Finally, set its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A&gt;</ph> because a line without a stroke is invisible.","pos":[661,826],"source":" Finally, set its <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Stroke%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.StrokeThickness%2A> because a line without a stroke is invisible."},{"pos":[833,953],"content":"Setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A&gt;</ph> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior.","source":"Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Shape.Fill%2A> element for a line has no effect, because a line has no interior."},{"pos":[960,1055],"content":"The following example draws three lines inside a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas&gt;</ph> element.","source":"The following example draws three lines inside a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas> element."},{"pos":[1064,1071],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1234,1376],"content":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>.","source":"This example is part of a larger sample; for the complete sample, see [Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)."},{"pos":[1385,1393],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1433,1504],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shape Elements Sample<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)</ept>","source":"[Shape Elements Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160037)"}]}
