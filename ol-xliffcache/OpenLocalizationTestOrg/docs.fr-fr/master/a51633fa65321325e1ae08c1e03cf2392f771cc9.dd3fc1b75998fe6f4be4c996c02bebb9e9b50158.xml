Its parameters provide the ability to overwrite existing files, rename the file, show the progress of the operation, and allow the user to cancel the operation.  \n  \n### To copy a text file to another folder  \n  \n-   Use the `CopyFile` method to copy a file, specifying a source file and the target directory. The`overwrite` parameter allows you to specify whether or not to overwrite existing files. The following code examples demonstrate how to use `CopyFile`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOMisc#24](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-create-a-copy-of-a-file-in-a-different-directory_1.vb)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception to be thrown:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\\\\\.\\\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The system could not retrieve the absolute path (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The source file is not valid or does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   The combined path points to an existing directory (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The destination file exists and `overwrite` is set to `False` (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have sufficient permissions to access the file (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   A file in the target folder with the same name is in use (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   A file or folder name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   `ShowUI` is set to `True`, `onUserCancel` is set to `ThrowException`, and the user has cancelled the operation (<xref:System.OperationCanceledException>).  \n  \n-   `ShowUI` is set to `True`, `onUserCancel` is set to `ThrowException`, and an unspecified I/O error occurs (<xref:System.OperationCanceledException>).  \n  \n-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have required permission (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the
