Often localizers need to resize and reposition elements in addition to translating text. In the past each language that a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment. Now with the capabilities of              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment. The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called              `automatic layout`.  \n  \n The following two              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] examples create applications that instantiate a button; one with English text and one with Spanish text. Notice that the code is the same except for the text; the button adjusts to fit the text.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationBtn_snip#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn_snip/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n [!code-xml[LocalizationBtn#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizationBtn/CS/Pane1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n The following graphic shows the output of the code samples.  \n  \n ![The same button with text in different languages](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/media/globalizationbutton.png \"GlobalizationButton\")  \nAuto Resizable Button  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Use Automatic Layout Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/use-automatic-layout-overview.md)   \n [Use a Grid for Automatic Layout](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-use-a-grid-for-automatic-layout.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,540],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-wpf\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Button controls, creating with automatic layout\"\n  - \"creating, buttons with automatic layout\"\n  - \"automatic layout, creating buttons\"\nms.assetid: 96c206d0-9e77-4784-9d2d-5045aed2021c\ncaps.latest.revision: 15\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[547,594],"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","linkify":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Automatic Layout to Create a Button","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"This example describes how to use the automatic layout approach to create a button in a localizable application.","pos":[595,707]},{"content":"Localization of a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> can be a time consuming process.","pos":[714,843],"source":"Localization of a              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] can be a time consuming process."},{"content":"Often localizers need to resize and reposition elements in addition to translating text.","pos":[844,932]},{"content":"In the past each language that a              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)]</ph> was adapted for required adjustment.","pos":[933,1083],"source":" In the past each language that a              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] was adapted for required adjustment."},{"content":"Now with the capabilities of              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment.","pos":[1084,1266],"source":" Now with the capabilities of              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] you can design elements that reduce the need for adjustment."},{"content":"The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called              <ph id=\"ph1\">`automatic layout`</ph>.","pos":[1267,1395],"source":" The approach to writing applications that can be more easily resized and repositioned is called              `automatic layout`."},{"content":"The following two              <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> examples create applications that instantiate a button;
