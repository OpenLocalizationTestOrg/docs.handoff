A switch statement filters on the cursor name and sets the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is named *DisplayArea*.  \n  \n If the cursor change is set to \"Entire Application\", the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.OverrideCursor%2A> property is set to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> control.  This forces the cursor to change for the whole application.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[cursors#ChangeCursorsSample](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/cursors/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#changecursorssample)]\n [!code-vb[cursors#ChangeCursorsSample](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/cursors/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#changecursorssample)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Input Overview](input-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Change the Cursor Type\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"mouse pointer [WPF], cursor type\"\n  - \"cursor (mouse pointer)\"\nms.assetid: 08c945a7-8ab0-4320-acf3-0b4955a344c2","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,30],"content":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","pos":[0,30]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[245,275],"content":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","linkify":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the Cursor Type","pos":[0,30]}]},{"pos":[276,416],"content":"This example shows how to change the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor&gt;</ph> of the mouse pointer for a specific element and for the application.","source":"This example shows how to change the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor> of the mouse pointer for a specific element and for the application."},{"pos":[423,548],"content":"This example consists of a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> file and a code behind file.","source":"This example consists of a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] file and a code behind file."},{"pos":[557,564],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[568,982],"content":"The user interface is created, which consists of a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox&gt;</ph> to select the desired <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor&gt;</ph>, a pair of <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton&gt;</ph> objects to determine if the cursor change applies to only a single element or applies to the entire application, and a <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border&gt;</ph> which is the element that the new cursor is applied to.","source":"The user interface is created, which consists of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox> to select the desired <xref:System.Windows.Input.Cursor>, a pair of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton> objects to determine if the cursor change applies to only a single element or applies to the entire application, and a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is the element that the new cursor is applied to."},{"content":"The following code behind creates a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Selector.SelectionChanged&gt;</ph> event handler which is called when the cursor type is changed in the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1124,1337],"source":"The following code behind creates a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Selector.SelectionChanged> event handler which is called when the cursor type is changed in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>."},{"content":"A switch statement filters on the cursor name and sets the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A&gt;</ph> property on the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border&gt;</ph> which is named <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>DisplayArea<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[1339,1530],"source":"  A switch statement filters on the cursor name and sets the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is named *DisplayArea*."},{"content":"If the cursor change is set to \"Entire Application\", the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.OverrideCursor%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A&gt;</ph> property of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1537,1780],"source":"If the cursor change is set to \"Entire Application\", the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.OverrideCursor%2A> property is set to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> control."},{"content":"This forces the cursor to change for the whole application.","pos":[1782,1841]},{"pos":[2139,2147],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2151,2186],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Input Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](input-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Input Overview](input-overview.md)"}]}
