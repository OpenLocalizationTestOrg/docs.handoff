This topic show how to create a client application that imports metadata from the service and then calls the `Add` method on the service.  \n  \n### To import metadata into service endpoints  \n  \n1.  Declare an <xref:System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress> object and initialize it with the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for the metadata exchange (MEX) address of the service.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[UE_ImportMetadata#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/ue_importmetadata/cs/client.cs#0)]  \n  \n2.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExchangeClient>, passing in the MEX address, and call <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataExchangeClient.GetMetadata%2A>. This retrieves the metadata from the service.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[UE_ImportMetadata#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/ue_importmetadata/cs/client.cs#1)]  \n  \n3.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter>, passing in the metadata previously retrieved, and call <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter.ImportAllContracts%2A>. This generates a collection of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ContractDescription> objects. You could also call <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter.ImportAllEndpoints%2A> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WsdlImporter.ImportAllBindings%2A>, depending upon your needs.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[UE_ImportMetadata#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/ue_importmetadata/cs/client.cs#2)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  After you have imported the metadata, you will not be able to create a client channel or export the metadata. This is because no type information is available at this point. Type information is required to actually interact with the service or export metadata. To generate the type information, you need to generate code, shown in steps 4 and 5. Alternatively, you could use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.MetadataResolver> helper class.

Generate type information for each contract.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[UE_ImportMetadata#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/ue_importmetadata/cs/client.cs#3)]  \n  \n5.  Now you can use this information.
