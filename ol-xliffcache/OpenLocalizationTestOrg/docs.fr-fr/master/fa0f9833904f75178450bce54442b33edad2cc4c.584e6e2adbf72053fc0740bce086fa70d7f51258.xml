The `ThrottleParallelForEach` activity derives from <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity>, because it needs to schedule other activities (the child activities) and this is only accessible through the <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivityContext> class.  \n  \n## Projects  \n  \n|**ProjectName**|**Description**|**Main Files**|  \n|-|-|-|  \n|ThrottledParallelForEach|Contains `ThrottledParallelForEach` activity and its designer.|ThrottledParallelForEach.cs<br /><br /> The `ThrottledParallelForEach` activity definition.|  \n|CodeTestClient|Sample client application that configures and runs a workflow with a `ThrottledParallelForEach` using imperative code.|Program.cs<br /><br /> Defines and runs an instance of the sample workflow.|  \n  \n#### To use this sample  \n  \n1.
