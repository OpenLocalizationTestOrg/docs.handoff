Inequality operators are predefined for all types, including string and object. User-defined types can overload the `!=` operator.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n For predefined value types, the inequality operator (`!=`) returns true if the values of its operands are different, false otherwise. For reference types other than `string`, `!=` returns true if its two operands refer to different objects. For the `string` type, `!=` compares the values of the strings.  \n  \n User-defined value types can overload the `!=` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). So can user-defined reference types, although by default `!=` behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types. If `!=` is overloaded, [==](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-comparison-operator.md) must also be overloaded. Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csRefOperators#33](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/not-equal-operator_1.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [C# Operators](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,55],"content":"!= Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"!= Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,43]}]},{"pos":[632,658],"content":"!= Operator (C# Reference)","linkify":"!= Operator (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"!= Operator (C# Reference)","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"The inequality operator (<ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph>) returns false if its operands are equal, true otherwise.","pos":[659,746],"source":"The inequality operator (`!=`) returns false if its operands are equal, true otherwise."},{"content":"Inequality operators are predefined for all types, including string and object.","pos":[747,826]},{"content":"User-defined types can overload the <ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph> operator.","pos":[827,877],"source":" User-defined types can overload the `!=` operator."},{"pos":[886,893],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"For predefined value types, the inequality operator (<ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph>) returns true if the values of its operands are different, false otherwise.","pos":[897,1030],"source":"For predefined value types, the inequality operator (`!=`) returns true if the values of its operands are different, false otherwise."},{"content":"For reference types other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`string`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`!=`</ph> returns true if its two operands refer to different objects.","pos":[1031,1137],"source":" For reference types other than `string`, `!=` returns true if its two operands refer to different objects."},{"content":"For the <ph id=\"ph1\">`string`</ph> type, <ph id=\"ph2\">`!=`</ph> compares the values of the strings.","pos":[1138,1201],"source":" For the `string` type, `!=` compares the values of the strings."},{"content":"User-defined value types can overload the <ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph> operator (see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)</ept>).","pos":[1208,1338],"source":"User-defined value types can overload the `!=` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md))."},{"content":"So can user-defined reference types, although by default <ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph> behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types.","pos":[1339,1481],"source":" So can user-defined reference types, although by default `!=` behaves as described above for both predefined and user-defined reference types."},{"content":"If <ph id=\"ph1\">`!=`</ph> is overloaded, <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph2\">==</ph><ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-comparison-operator.md)</ept> must also be overloaded.","pos":[1482,1612],"source":" If `!=` is overloaded, [==](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/equality-comparison-operator.md) must also be overloaded."},{"content":"Operations on integral types are generally allowed on enumeration.","pos":[1613,1679]},{"pos":[1688,1695],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1699,1817],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csRefOperators#33<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/not-equal-operator_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csRefOperators#33](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/not-equal-operator_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[1826,1834],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1838,1898],"source":"[C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1901,1969],"source":" [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>C# Operators<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1972,2042],"source":" [C# Operators](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)"}]}
