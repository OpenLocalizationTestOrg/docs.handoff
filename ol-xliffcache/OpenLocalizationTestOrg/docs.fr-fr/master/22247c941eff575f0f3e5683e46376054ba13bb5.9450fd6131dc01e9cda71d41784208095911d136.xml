For more information about using print preview with the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Print in Windows Forms Using Print Preview](../advanced/how-to-print-in-windows-forms-using-print-preview.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control at run time, users must have a printer installed on their computer, either locally or through a network, as this is partly how the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> component determines how a document will look when printed.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control uses the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> class. Additionally, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control uses the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings> class, just as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> component does. The print document specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl.Document%2A> property refers to instances of both the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings> classes, and these are used to render the document in the preview window.  \n  \n### To view pages using the PrintPreviewDialog control  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CommonDialog.ShowDialog%2A> method to display the dialog box, specifying the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> to use.  \n  \n     In the following code example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event handler opens an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control. The print document is specified in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog.Document%2A> property. In the example below, no print document is specified.  \n  \n     The example requires that your form has a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control, a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component named `myDocument`, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n       ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n       ' The print document 'myDocument' used below  \n       ' is merely for an example.  \n       ' You will have to specify your own print document.  \n       PrintPreviewDialog1.Document = myDocument  \n       PrintPreviewDialog1.ShowDialog()  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       // The print document 'myDocument' used below  \n       // is merely for an example.  \n       // You will have to specify your own print document.  \n       printPreviewDialog1.Document = myDocument;  \n       printPreviewDialog1.ShowDialog();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void button1_Click(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::EventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          // The print document 'myDocument' used below  \n          // is merely for an example.  \n          // You will have to specify your own print document.  \n          printPreviewDialog1->Document = myDocument;  \n          printPreviewDialog1->ShowDialog();  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     (Visual C#, [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->button1->Click += gcnew  \n       System::EventHandler(this, &Form1::button1_Click);  \n    ```  \n  \n## See
