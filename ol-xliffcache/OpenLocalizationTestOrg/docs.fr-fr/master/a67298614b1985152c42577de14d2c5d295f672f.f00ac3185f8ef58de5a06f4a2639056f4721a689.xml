MDI forms can also <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls.  \n  \n There is extensive support for this feature in Visual Studio.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Creating an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls](walkthrough-creating-an-mdi-form-with-menu-merging-and-toolstrip-controls.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> controls with an MDI form. The form also supports menu merging with child menus.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.MdiForm/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This code example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ToolStrip Control](toolstrip-control-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,363],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"toolbars [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"ToolStripPanel control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"ToolStrip control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"MenuStrip control [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 64992ed9-44af-4baf-b45f-863e6ab35711","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","nodes":[{"pos":[0,67],"content":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","pos":[0,67]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[370,437],"content":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","linkify":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> namespace supports multiple document interface (MDI) applications, and the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip&gt;</ph> control supports menu merging.","pos":[438,642],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace supports multiple document interface (MDI) applications, and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control supports menu merging."},{"content":"MDI forms can also <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip&gt;</ph> controls.","pos":[643,709],"source":" MDI forms can also <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> controls."},{"content":"There is extensive support for this feature in Visual Studio.","pos":[716,777]},{"pos":[784,948],"content":"Also see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Walkthrough: Creating an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](walkthrough-creating-an-mdi-form-with-menu-merging-and-toolstrip-controls.md)</ept>.","source":"Also see [Walkthrough: Creating an MDI Form with Menu Merging and ToolStrip Controls](walkthrough-creating-an-mdi-form-with-menu-merging-and-toolstrip-controls.md)."},{"pos":[957,964],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example demonstrates how to use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel&gt;</ph> controls with an MDI form.","pos":[968,1088],"source":"The following code example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripPanel> controls with an MDI form."},{"content":"The form also supports menu merging with child menus.","pos":[1089,1142]},{"pos":[1475,1493],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This code example requires:","pos":[1497,1524]},{"content":"References to the System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.","pos":[1534,1603]},{"content":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md)</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Command-line Building With csc.exe<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)</ept>.","pos":[1610,1964],"source":"For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)."},{"content":"You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.","pos":[1965,2053]},{"pos":[2062,2070],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2074,2129],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ToolStrip Control<ept id=\"p1\">](toolstrip-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[ToolStrip Control](toolstrip-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
