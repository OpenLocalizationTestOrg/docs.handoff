This count can be included either along with the query result or as an integer value. For more information, see [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This example executes a query after calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.IncludeTotalCount%2A> method. The <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.QueryOperationResponse%601.TotalCount%2A> property returns the number of entities in the `Customers` entity set.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#CountAllCustomers](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#countallcustomers)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#CountAllCustomers](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#countallcustomers)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example calls the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Count%2A> method to return only an integer value that is the number of entities in the `Customers` entity set.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#CountAllCustomersValueOnly](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#countallcustomersvalueonly)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#CountAllCustomersValueOnly](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#countallcustomersvalueonly)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Querying the Data Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/querying-the-data-service-wcf-data-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,255],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Determine the Number of Entities Returned by a Query (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
