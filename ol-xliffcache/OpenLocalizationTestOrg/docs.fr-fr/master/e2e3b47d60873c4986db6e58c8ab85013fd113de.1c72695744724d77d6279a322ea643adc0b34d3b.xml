You can provide this functionality in your Windows Forms by handling the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  \n  \n The following procedure requires that you have created a Windows-based application with a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component on it, which is the standard way of enabling printing from a Windows-based application. For more information about printing from Windows Forms using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md).  \n  \n### To complete a print job  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    PrintDocument1.DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\"  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    printDocument1.DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\";  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    printDocument1->DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\";  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event.  \n  \n     In the following code example, a message box is displayed, indicating that the document has finished printing.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_EndPrint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.EndPrint  \n       MessageBox.Show(PrintDocument1.DocumentName + \" has finished printing.\")  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void printDocument1_EndPrint(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       MessageBox.Show(printDocument1.DocumentName +   \n          \" has finished printing.\");  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_EndPrint(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          MessageBox::Show(String::Concat(printDocument1->DocumentName,  \n             \" has finished printing.\"));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.EndPrint += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_EndPrint);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->printDocument1->EndPrint += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_EndPrint);  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>   \n [Windows Forms Print Support](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[519,560],"content":"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs","linkify":"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"Frequently, word processors and other applications that involve printing will provide the option to display a message to users that a print job is complete.","pos":[561,717]},{"content":"You can provide this functionality in your Windows Forms by handling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint&gt;</ph> event of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[718,913],"source":" You can provide this functionality in your Windows Forms by handling the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component."},{"content":"The following procedure requires that you have created a Windows-based application with a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component on it, which is the standard way of enabling printing from a Windows-based application.","pos":[920,1152],"source":"The following procedure requires that you have created a Windows-based application with a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component on it, which is the standard way of enabling printing from a Windows-based application."},{"content":"For more information about printing from Windows Forms using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md)</ept>.","pos":[1153,1426],"source":" For more information about printing from Windows Forms using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md)."},{"pos":[1436,1459],"content":"To complete a print job","linkify":"To complete a print job","nodes":[{"content":"To complete a print job","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A&gt;</ph> property of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[1469,1609],"source":"Set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component."},{"content":"Write code to handle the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint&gt;</ph> event.","pos":[1855,1940],"source":"Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event."},{"content":"In the following code example, a message box is displayed, indicating that the document has finished printing.","pos":[1951,2061]},{"pos":[2899,3094],"content":"(<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]</ph>) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.","source":"([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler."},{"pos":[3445,3453],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Windows Forms Print Support<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)</ept>","pos":[3505,3612],"source":" [Windows Forms Print Support](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)"}]}
