The decision to use SSL is made by the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> class, based on the URI it is given. If the URI begins with \"https:\", SSL is used; if the URI begins with \"http:\", an unencrypted connection is used.  \n  \n To use SSL with File Transfer Protocol (FTP), set the <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.EnableSsl> property to true prior to calling <xref:System.Net.FtpWebRequest.GetResponse>. Similarly, to use SSL with Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP), set the <xref:System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.EnableSsl> property to true prior to sending the email.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Net.Security.SslStream> class provides a stream-based abstraction for SSL, and offers many ways to configure the SSL handshake.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```vb  \nDim MyURI As String = \"https://www.contoso.com/\"  \nDim Wreq As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(MyURI)  \n  \nDim serverUri As String = \"ftp://ftp.contoso.com/file.txt\"  \nDim request As FtpWebRequest = CType(WebRequest.Create(serverUri), FtpWebRequest)  \nrequest.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DeleteFile  \nrequest.EnableSsl = True  \nDim response As FtpWebResponse = CType(request.GetResponse(), FtpWebResponse)  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nString MyURI = \"https://www.contoso.com/\";  \nWebRequest WReq = WebRequest.Create(MyURI);  \n  \nString serverUri = \"ftp://ftp.contoso.com/file.txt\"  \nFtpWebRequest request = (FtpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(serverUri);  \nrequest.EnableSsl = true;  \nrequest.Method = WebRequestMethods.Ftp.DeleteFile;  \nFtpWebResponse response = (FtpWebResponse)request.GetResponse();  \n```  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the **System.Net** namespace.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Security in Network Programming](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/security-in-network-programming.md)\n- [Network Programming in the .NET Framework](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/index.md)\n- [Certificate Selection and Validation](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/certificate-selection-and-validation.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,465],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using Secure Sockets Layer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Networking\"\n  - \"SSL\"\n  - \"Secure Sockets Layer\"\n  - \"requesting data from Internet, Secure Sockets Layer\"\n  - \"sending data, Secure Sockets Layer\"\n  - \"Network Resources\"\n  - \"data requests, Secure Sockets Layer\"\n  - \"receiving data, Secure Sockets Layer\"\n  - \"Internet, Secure Sockets Layer\"\nms.assetid: 6e4289e6-d1b7-4e82-ab0d-e83e3b6063ed","nodes":[{"content":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,26],"content":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","nodes":[{"content":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","pos":[0,26]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[472,498],"content":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","linkify":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","nodes":[{"content":"Using Secure Sockets Layer","pos":[0,26]}]},{"pos":[499,620],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net&gt;</ph> classes use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the connection for several network protocols.","source":"The <xref:System.Net> classes use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt the connection for several network protocols."},{"content":"For http connections, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebResponse&gt;</ph> classes use SSL to communicate with web hosts that support SSL.","pos":[627,779],"source":"For http connections, the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> and <xref:System.Net.WebResponse> classes use SSL to communicate with web hosts that support SSL."},{"content":"The decision to use SSL is made by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.WebRequest&gt;</ph> class, based on the URI it is given.","pos":[780,884],"source":" The decision to use SSL is made by the <xref:System.Net.WebRequest> class, based on the URI it is given."},{"content":"If the URI begins with \"https:\", SSL is used;
