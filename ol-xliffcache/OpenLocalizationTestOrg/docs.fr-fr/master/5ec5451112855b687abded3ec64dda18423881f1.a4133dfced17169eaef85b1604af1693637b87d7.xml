It retrieves the text from the paragraph, and then deletes all text runs in the paragraph. It creates a new text run that consists of the first paragraph text that has been converted to upper case. It then serializes the changed XML into the Open XML package and closes it.  \n  \n This example uses classes found in the WindowsBase assembly. It uses types in the <xref:System.IO.Packaging?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports <xmlns:w=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\">  \n  \nModule Module1  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As String In source  \n            sb.Append(s)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String)) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item))  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each s As T In source  \n            sb.Append(s).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    <System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Extension()> _  \n    Public Function StringConcatenate(Of T)(ByVal source As IEnumerable(Of T), _  \n    ByVal func As Func(Of T, String), ByVal separator As String) As String  \n        Dim sb As StringBuilder = New StringBuilder()  \n        For Each item As T In source  \n            sb.Append(func(item)).Append(separator)  \n        Next  \n        Return sb.ToString()  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Public Function ParagraphText(ByVal e As XElement) As String  \n        Dim w As XNamespace = e.Name.Namespace  \n        Return (e.<w:r>.<w:t>).StringConcatenate(Function(element) CStr(element))  \n    End Function  \n  \n    ' Following function is required because VB does not support short circuit evaluation  \n    Private Function GetStyleOfParagraph(ByVal styleNode As XElement, _  \n                                         ByVal defaultStyle As String) As String  \n        If (styleNode Is Nothing) Then  \n            Return defaultStyle  \n        Else  \n            Return styleNode.@w:val  \n        End If  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim fileName = \"SampleDoc.docx\"  \n  \n        Dim documentRelationshipType = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/officeDocument\"  \n        Dim stylesRelationshipType = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships/styles\"  \n        Dim wordmlNamespace = _  \n          \"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main\"  \n  \n        Using wdPackage As Package = Package.Open(fileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.ReadWrite)  \n            Dim docPackageRelationship As PackageRelationship = wdPackage _  \n                    .GetRelationshipsByType(documentRelationshipType).FirstOrDefault()  \n            If (docPackageRelationship IsNot Nothing) Then  \n                Dim documentUri As Uri = PackUriHelper.ResolvePartUri(New Uri(\"/\", _  \n                            UriKind.Relative), docPackageRelationship.TargetUri)  \n                Dim documentPart As PackagePart = wdPackage.GetPart(documentUri)  \n  \n                '  Load the document XML in the part into an XDocument instance.  \n                Dim xDoc As XDocument = XDocument.Load(XmlReader.Create(documentPart.GetStream()))  \n  \n                '  Find the styles part.
