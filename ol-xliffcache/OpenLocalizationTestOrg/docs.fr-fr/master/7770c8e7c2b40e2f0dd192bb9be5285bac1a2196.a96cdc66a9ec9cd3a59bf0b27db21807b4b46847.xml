Assume that the variable `point` holds the location of the most recent click. The code checks to see whether `point` is in the plus-shaped region. If the point is in the region (a hit), the region is filled with an opaque red brush. Otherwise, the region is filled with a semitransparent red brush.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Region>   \n [Regions in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/regions-in-gdi.md)   \n [How to: Use Clipping with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[484,521],"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","linkify":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The purpose of hit testing is to determine whether the cursor is over a given object, such as an icon or a button.","pos":[522,636]},{"pos":[645,652],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates a plus-shaped region by forming the union of two rectangular regions.","pos":[656,755]},{"content":"Assume that the variable <ph id=\"ph1\">`point`</ph> holds the location of the most recent click.","pos":[756,833],"source":" Assume that the variable `point` holds the location of the most recent click."},{"content":"The code checks to see whether <ph id=\"ph1\">`point`</ph> is in the plus-shaped region.","pos":[834,902],"source":" The code checks to see whether `point` is in the plus-shaped region."},{"content":"If the point is in the region (a hit), the region is filled with an opaque red brush.","pos":[903,988]},{"content":"Otherwise, the region is filled with a semitransparent red brush.","pos":[989,1054]},{"pos":[1061,1376],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#31)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept> <bpt id=\"p3\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p4\">[</bpt>System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31<ept id=\"p4\">](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#31)</ept><ept id=\"p3\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#31)]"},{"pos":[1385,1403],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1407,1603],"content":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`e`</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1612,1620],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Regions in GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/regions-in-gdi.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1656,1739],"source":" [Regions in GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/regions-in-gdi.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Use Clipping with a Region<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)</ept>","pos":[1742,1862],"source":" [How to: Use Clipping with a Region](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)"}]}
