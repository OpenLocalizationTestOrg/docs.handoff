A search for all matching elements is then performed with the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A> method that incorporates a series of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AndCondition> boolean operations to limit the number of matching elements.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When searching from the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.RootElement%2A>, you should try to obtain only direct children. A search for descendants might iterate through hundreds or even thousands of elements, possibly resulting in a stack overflow. If you are attempting to obtain a specific element at a lower level, you should start your search from the application window or from a container at a lower level.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[InvokePatternApp#1100](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InvokePatternApp/CSharp/InvokePatternApp.cs#1100)]\n [!code-vb[InvokePatternApp#1100](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InvokePatternApp/VisualBasic/Client.vb#1100)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [InvokePattern and ExpandCollapsePattern Menu Item Sample](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b7fa141c-e2d1-4da2-a27f-81a7d1172210)   \n [Obtaining UI Automation Elements](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/obtaining-ui-automation-elements.md)   \n [Use the AutomationID Property](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-the-automationid-property.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,87],"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,75]}]},{"pos":[517,575],"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","linkify":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","nodes":[{"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[578,1040],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
