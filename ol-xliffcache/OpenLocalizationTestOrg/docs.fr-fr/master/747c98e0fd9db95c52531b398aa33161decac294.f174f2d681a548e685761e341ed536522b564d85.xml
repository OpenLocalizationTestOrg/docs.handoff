For example, on the Macintosh, it creates a set of files whose filename concatenates the directory path, along with any backslash (\"\\\\\") characters, and the filename. As a result, the directory structure of decompressed files is not preserved.  \n  \n The impact of this change on .ZIP files that are decompressed on the Windows operating system by APIs in the .NET Framework <xref:System.IO> namespace should be minimal, since these APIs can seamlessly handle either a slash (\"/\") or a backslash (\"\\\\\") as the path separator character.  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n If this behavior is undesirable, you can opt out of by adding a configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of your application configuration file. The following shows both the `<runtime>` section and the opt-out switch.  \n  \n```  \n  \n<runtime>  \n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.UseBackslash=true\" />  \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n In addition, apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework but are running on the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and later versions can opt in to this behavior by adding a configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the application configuration file. The following shows both the `<runtime>` section and the opt-in switch.  \n  \n```  \n  \n<runtime>  \n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IO.Compression.ZipFile.UseBackslash=false\"
