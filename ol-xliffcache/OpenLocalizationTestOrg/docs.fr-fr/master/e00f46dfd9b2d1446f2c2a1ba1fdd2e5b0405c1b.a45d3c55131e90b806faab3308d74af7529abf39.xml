This custom logic is provided as methods, referenced as <xref:System.Func%602> delegates, that return a value of `false` when the default behavior should still be performed when the custom method completes and `true` when subsequent processing of the event should be stopped.  \n  \n The examples in this topic supply custom methods for both the `entityChanged` and `entityCollectionChanged` parameters of <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601>. The examples in this topic use the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code-behind page for the XAML file creates a <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceCollection%601> with custom methods that are called when changes occur to data that is bound to the binding collection. When the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601.CollectionChanged> event occurs, the supplied method prevents an item that has been removed from the binding collection from being deleted from the data service. When the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601.PropertyChanged> event occurs, the `ShipDate` value is validated to ensure that changes are not made to orders that have already shipped.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#WpfDataBindingCustom](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind
