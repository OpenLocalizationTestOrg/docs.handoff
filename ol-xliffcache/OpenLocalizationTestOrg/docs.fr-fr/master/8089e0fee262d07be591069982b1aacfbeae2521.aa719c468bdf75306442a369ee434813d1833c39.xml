Make the following change:\n\n   1. In the **Solution Explorer** window, select the **GettingStartedHost** folder, and then select **Properties** from the shortcut menu.\n    a. In the **GettingStartedHost** window, for **Startup object**, select **Service.Program** (or the entry point for your particular application) from the list. \n    b. From the main menu, select **File** > **Save All**.\n\n### Run the service application \n\n**HTTP could not register URL 'http:\\//+:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService'. Your process does not have access rights to this namespace.** \n\n For proper access, start the process hosting the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service with administrative privileges:\n- For Visual Studio: Select the Visual Studio program in the **Start** menu, and then select **More** > **Run as administrator** from the shortcut menu.\n- For a console window: Select **Command Prompt** in the **Start** menu, and then select **More** > **Run As administrator** from the shortcut menu.\n- For Windows Explorer: Select the executable, and then select **Run as administrator** from the shortcut menu.\n\n### Compile the client application\n\n**'CalculatorClient', does not contain a definition for '\\<method name>' and no extension method '\\<method name>' accepting a first argument of type 'CalculatorClient' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)**  \n\nOnly those methods that you mark with the `ServiceOperationAttribute` attribute are publically exposed. If you omit the `ServiceOperationAttribute` attribute from a method in the `ICalculator` interface, you receive this error message during compilation.  \n\n**The type or namespace name 'CalculatorClient' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)**\n\n You receive this error if you don't add the *generatedProxy.cs* (or *generatedProxy.vb*) file to your client project when you generated them with the *Svcutil.exe* tool.  \n\n### Run the client application\n\n**Unhandled Exception: System.ServiceModel.EndpointNotFoundException: Could not connect to 'http:\\//localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService'. TCP error code 10061: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.**\n\nThis error occurs if you run the client application without first starting the service. First, run the host application to start the service, and then run the client application.\n\n### Use the Svcutil.exe tool\n   \n**'Svcutil' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.**\n\n *Svcutil.exe* must be in the system path. The easiest solution is to use the Visual Studio command prompt. From the **Start** menu, select the **Visual Studio \\<version>** directory, then select **Developer Command Prompt for VS \\<version>**. This command prompt sets the system path to the correct locations for all tools shipped as part of Visual Studio.  \n  \n### Run the service and client applications\n\n**System.ServiceModel.Security.SecurityNegotiationException: SOAP security negotiation with 'http:\\//localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService' for target 'http:\\//localhost:8000/GettingStarted/CalculatorService' failed**  \n\nThis error occurs on a domain-joined computer that doesn't have network connectivity. Connect your computer to the network or turn off security for both the service and the client. \n\nTo turn off security:\n\n- For the service, replace the code that creates the `WSHttpBinding` with the following code:  \n  \n    ```csharp\n    // Step 3: Add a service endpoint.\n    selfhost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculator), new WSHttpBinding(SecurityMode.None), \"CalculatorService\");  \n    ```\n\n- For the client, in the configuration file, update the **\\<security>** element under the **\\<binding>** element as follows:  \n  \n    ```xml\n    <binding name=\"WSHttpBinding_ICalculator\" security mode=\"None\" />\n    ```  \n\n## See also  \n [Get started with WCF applications](getting-started-tutorial.md)  \n [WCF troubleshooting quickstart](wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md)  \n [Troubleshooting setup issues](troubleshooting-setup-issues.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,156],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials\nms.date: 01/25/2019\nms.assetid: 69a21511-0871-4c41-9a53-93110e84d7fd","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","pos":[0,76]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[163,239],"content":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","linkify":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshoot the Get started with Windows Communication Foundation tutorials","pos":[0,76]}]},{"pos":[241,465],"content":"This article provides solutions for the most common problems and errors you might face when you follow the steps in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications<ept id=\"p1\">](getting-started-tutorial.md)</ept>.","source":"This article provides solutions for the most common problems and errors you might face when you follow the steps in the [Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications](getting-started-tutorial.md)."},{"pos":[473,488],"content":"Common problems","linkify":"Common problems","nodes":[{"content":"Common problems","pos":[0,15]}]},{"pos":[490,542],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>I can't find the project files on my hard drive.<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**I can't find the project files on my hard drive.**"},{"pos":[545,625],"content":"Visual Studio saves project files in <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>C:\\Users<ph id=\"ph1\">\\\\</ph><ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;lt;</ph>user name<ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;gt;</ph>\\source\\repos<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","source":"Visual Studio saves project files in *C:\\Users\\\\&lt;user name&gt;\\source\\repos*."},{"pos":[629,695],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>I can't find the <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>App.config<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept> file generated by <bpt id=\"p3\">*</bpt>Svcutil.exe<ept id=\"p3\">*</ept>.<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**I can't find the *App.config* file generated by *Svcutil.exe*.**"},{"pos":[698,810],"content":"In Visual Studio, the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add Existing Item<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> window only displays files with the following extensions by default:","source":"In Visual Studio, the **Add Existing Item** window only displays files with the following extensions by default:"},{"pos":[814,819],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>.cs<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>","source":"*.cs*"},{"pos":[823,830],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>.resx<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>","source":"*.resx*"},{"pos":[834,845],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>.settings<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>","source":"*.settings*"},{"pos":[848,854],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>.xsd<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>","source":"*.xsd*"},{"pos":[858,865],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>.wsdl<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>","source":"*.wsdl*"},{"pos":[867,1007],"content":"To display all file types, select <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>All Files (<ph id=\"ph1\">\\*</ph>.<ph id=\"ph2\">\\*</ph>)<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in the drop-down list in the lower-right corner of the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Add Existing Item<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> window.","source":"To display all file types, select **All Files (\\*.\\*)** in the drop-down list in the lower-right corner of the **Add Existing Item** window."},{"pos":[1016,1029],"content":"Common errors","linkify":"Common errors","nodes":[{"content":"Common errors","pos":[0,13]}]},{"pos":[1035,1066],"content":"Compile the service application","linkify":"Compile the service application","nodes":[{"content":"Compile the service application","pos":[0,31]}]},{"pos":[1069,1144],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error BC30420 'Sub Main' was not found in 'GettingStartedHost.Module1'.<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Error BC30420 'Sub Main' was not found in 'GettingStartedHost.Module1'.**"},{"content":"The entry point is incorrect for the Visual Basic application.","pos":[1146,1208]},{"content":"Make the following change:","pos":[1209,1235]},{"pos":[1243,1600],"content":"In the **Solution Explorer** window, select the **GettingStartedHost** folder, and then select **Properties** from the shortcut menu.\na.
