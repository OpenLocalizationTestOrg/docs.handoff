A binding contains the following elements:  \n  \n-   The protocol stack determines the security, reliability, and context flow settings to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint.  \n  \n-   The transport determines the underlying transport protocol to use when sending messages to the endpoint, for example, TCP or HTTP.  \n  \n-   The encoding determines the wire encoding to use for messages that are sent to the endpoint, for example, text/XML, binary, or Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM).  \n  \n This topic presents all of the system-provided [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] bindings. If none of these meets the exact criteria for your application, you can create a custom binding. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] creating custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n A secure and interoperable binding that supports the WS-Federation protocol enables organizations that are in a federation to efficiently authenticate and authorize users.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Always select a binding that includes security. By default, all bindings except the [\\<basicHttpBinding>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md) element have security enabled. If you do not select a secure binding or disable security, be sure to protect your data in some other manner, such as storing in a secured data center or on an isolated network.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Never use duplex contracts with bindings that do not support security or that have security disabled unless you secure the data by some other means.  \n  \n## System-Provided Bindings  \n The following bindings ship with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n|Binding|Configuration Element|Description|  \n|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>|[\\<basicHttpBinding>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md)|A binding that is suitable for communicating with WS-Basic Profile conformant Web services, for example, ASP.NET Web services (ASMX)-based services.
