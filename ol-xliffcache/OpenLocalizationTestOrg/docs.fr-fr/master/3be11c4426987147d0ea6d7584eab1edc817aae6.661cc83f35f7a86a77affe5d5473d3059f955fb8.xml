The `TrackBar` control has two parts: the thumb, also known as a slider, and the tick marks. The thumb is the part that can be adjusted. Its position corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Value%2A> property. The tick marks are visual indicators that are spaced at regular intervals. The track bar moves in increments that you specify and can be aligned horizontally or vertically. An example use of a track bar would be for setting cursor blink rate or mouse speed.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [TrackBar Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/trackbar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `TrackBar` control, which allows users to navigate through information by visually adjusting a numeric setting.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar> class  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"TrackBar Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"TrackBar Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[495,527],"content":"TrackBar Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"TrackBar Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"TrackBar Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`TrackBar`</ph> control (also sometimes called a \"slider\" control) is used for navigating through a large amount of information or for visually adjusting a numeric setting.","pos":[528,713],"source":"The Windows Forms `TrackBar` control (also sometimes called a \"slider\" control) is used for navigating through a large amount of information or for visually adjusting a numeric setting."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`TrackBar`</ph> control has two parts: the thumb, also known as a slider, and the tick marks.","pos":[714,806],"source":" The `TrackBar` control has two parts: the thumb, also known as a slider, and the tick marks."},{"content":"The thumb is the part that can be adjusted.","pos":[807,850]},{"content":"Its position corresponds to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Value%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[851,938],"source":" Its position corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar.Value%2A> property."},{"content":"The tick marks are visual indicators that are spaced at regular intervals.","pos":[939,1013]},{"content":"The track bar moves in increments that you specify and can be aligned horizontally or vertically.","pos":[1014,1111]},{"content":"An example use of a track bar would be for setting cursor blink rate or mouse speed.","pos":[1112,1196]},{"pos":[1205,1220],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>TrackBar Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/trackbar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1224,1340],"source":"[TrackBar Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/trackbar-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Introduces the general concepts of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`TrackBar`</ph> control, which allows users to navigate through information by visually adjusting a numeric setting.","pos":[1344,1494],"source":" Introduces the general concepts of the `TrackBar` control, which allows users to navigate through information by visually adjusting a numeric setting."},{"pos":[1503,1512],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar&gt;</ph> class","pos":[1516,1558],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar> class"},{"content":"Provides reference information on the class and its members.","pos":[1562,1622]},{"pos":[1631,1647],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1651,1767],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1771,1862]}]}
