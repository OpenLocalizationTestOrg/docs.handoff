\n## In This Section  \n [ADO.NET](../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/index.md)  \n Describes the ADO.NET architecture and how to use the ADO.NET classes to manage application data and interact with data sources, including Microsoft SQL Server, OLE DB data sources, and XML.  \n  \n [LINQ Portal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/6eb15c76-4ee6-4146-981e-b3429a945e6f)  \n Provides links to relevant documentation for Language Integrated Query (LINQ).  \n  \n [Transaction Processing](../../../docs/framework/data/transactions/index.md)  \n Discusses the .NET Framework support for transactions.  \n  \n [WCF Data Services 4.5](../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/index.md)  \n Provides information about how to use WCF Data Services to deploy data services on the Web or an intranet.  \n  \n [XML Documents and Data](../../../docs/standard/data/xml/index.md)  \n Provides an overview to a comprehensive and integrated set of classes that work with XML documents and data in the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [XML Standards Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/79c78508-c9d0-423a-a00f-672e855de401)  \n Provides reference information on XML standards that Microsoft supports.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Microsoft SQL Server Modeling Technologies](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=193039)  \n Describes a set of technologies that enable rapid and customized data-based application design and development.  \n  \n [Development Guide](../../../docs/framework/development-guide.md)  \n Provides a guide to all key technology areas and tasks for application development, including creating, configuring, debugging, securing, and deploying your application, and information about dynamic programming, interoperability, extensibility, memory management, and threading.  \n  \n [Security](../../../docs/standard/security/index.md)  \n Provides links to more information on the classes and services in the common language runtime and the .NET Framework that facilitate secure application development.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Data and Modeling in the .NET Framework | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Data and Modeling in the
