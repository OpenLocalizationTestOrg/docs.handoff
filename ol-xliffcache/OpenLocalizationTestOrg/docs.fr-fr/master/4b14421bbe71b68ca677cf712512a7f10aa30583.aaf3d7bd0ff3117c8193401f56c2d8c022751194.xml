When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The host typically calls `GetMonitorOwner` as part of a deadlock-detection mechanism. The cookie is associated with a monitor when it is created by using a call to [IHostSyncManager::CreateMonitorEvent](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsyncmanager-createmonitorevent-method.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  A call to release the event underlying the monitor might block—but will not deadlock—if a call to this method is currently in effect on the cookie associated with that monitor. Other tasks might also block if they attempt to acquire this monitor.  \n  \n `GetMonitorOwner` always returns immediately and can be called any time after a call to `CreateMonitorEvent`. The host does not need to wait until a task is waiting on the event.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ICLRSyncManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrsyncmanager-interface.md)\n- [IHostSyncManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostsyncmanager-interface.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,492],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ICLRSyncManager::GetMonitorOwner Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  -
