This distinction is designed to allow hosts to set different policies depending on where a failure occurs in the code.  \n  \n A *critical region of code* is any space where the CLR cannot guarantee that aborting a task or failing to complete a request for resources will affect only the current task. For example, if a task is holding a lock and receives an HRESULT that indicates failure upon making a memory allocation request, it is insufficient simply to abort that task to ensure the stability of the <xref:System.AppDomain>, because the <xref:System.AppDomain> might contain other tasks waiting for the same lock. To abandon the current task might cause those other tasks to stop responding (or hang) indefinitely. In such a case, the host needs the ability to unload the entire <xref:System.AppDomain> rather than risk potential instability.  \n  \n A *non-critical region of code*, on the other hand, is a region where the CLR can guarantee that an abort or a failure will affect only the task upon which the error occurs.  \n  \n The CLR also distinguishes between graceful and non-graceful (rude) aborts. In general, a normal or graceful abort makes every effort to run exception-handling routines and finalizers before aborting a task, while a rude abort makes no such guarantees.  \n  \n## Requirements
