The value must be in the range of 1 to 65535.|Correct the `-port:<portNum>`<br /><br /> command line option as indicated in the error message.|  \n|6|An invalid endpoint certificate was specified on the command line.  The certificate could not be found, or it did not pass verification.|Correct the `-endpointCert` command line option. Ensure that the certificate has a private key, is intended to be used for both ClientAuthentication and ServerAuthentication, is installed in the LocalMachine\\MY certificate store, and is fully trusted.|  \n|7|An invalid accounts certificate was specified on the command line.|Correct the `-accountsCerts` command line option. The certificate specified was either improperly specified or it could not be found.|  \n|8|A default timeout was specified outside the range of 1 to 3600 seconds.|Enter a correct default timeout value as indicated.|  \n|10|An unexpected error occurred while trying to access the registry.|Check the error message and error code for actionable items|  \n|11|Cannot write to the registry.|Ensure that the key listed in the error message is capable of supporting registry access from the account WsatConfig.exe was executed under.|  \n|12|An unexpected error occurred while trying to access the certificate store.|Use the error code returned to map to the appropriate system error.|  \n|13|Configuration of http.sys failed.
