Typically, when you draw on a form, you handle the form’s  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event and perform the drawing using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, as shown in this example  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.UsingAPen#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.UsingAPen/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n You should always call <xref:System.IDisposable.Dispose%2A> on any objects that consume system resources, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> objects.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>\n- [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)\n- [Using a Pen to Draw Lines and Shapes](using-a-pen-to-draw-lines-and-shapes.md)\n- [Graphics and Drawing in Windows Forms](graphics-and-drawing-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,364],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw a Line on a Windows Form\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
