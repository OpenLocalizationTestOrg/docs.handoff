Additional information is considered that was not looked at in the past. This warning indicates that the delegate is now bound to a different overload of the method than it was previously bound to. You may wish to verify that the delegate really should be bound to 'MethodName1' instead of 'MethodName2'.  \n  \n For a description of how the compiler determines which method to bind a delegate to, see [Using Variance in Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6acad03-93e0-4efb-a158-8696d5eb4ecf).","nodes":[{"pos":[12,62],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]},{"pos":[577,610],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 1) CS1707","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"Delegate 'DelegateName' bound to 'MethodName1' instead of 'MethodName2' because of new language rules","pos":[611,712]},{"content":"C# 2.0 implements new rules for binding a delegate to a method.","pos":[719,782]},{"content":"Additional information is considered that was not looked at in the past.","pos":[783,855]},{"content":"This warning indicates that the delegate is now bound to a different overload of the method than it was previously bound to.","pos":[856,980]},{"content":"You may wish to verify that the delegate really should be bound to 'MethodName1' instead of 'MethodName2'.","pos":[981,1087]},{"pos":[1094,1285],"content":"For a description of how the compiler determines which method to bind a delegate to, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Variance in Delegates<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6acad03-93e0-4efb-a158-8696d5eb4ecf)</ept>.","source":"For a description of how the compiler determines which method to bind a delegate to, see [Using Variance in Delegates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e6acad03-93e0-4efb-a158-8696d5eb4ecf)."}]}
