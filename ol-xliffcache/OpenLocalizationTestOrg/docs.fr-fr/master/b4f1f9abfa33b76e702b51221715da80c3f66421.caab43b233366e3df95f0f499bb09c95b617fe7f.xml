The following example loads books.xml and outputs the XML tree to the console.  \n  \n This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md).  \n  \n```vb  \nDim booksFromFile As XElement = XElement.Load(\"books.xml\")  \nConsole.WriteLine(booksFromFile)  \n```  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Catalog>  \n  <Book id=\"bk101\">  \n    <Author>Garghentini, Davide</Author>  \n    <Title>XML Developer's Guide</Title>  \n    <Genre>Computer</Genre>  \n    <Price>44.95</Price>  \n    <PublishDate>2000-10-01</PublishDate>  \n    <Description>An in-depth look at creating applications   \n      with XML.</Description>  \n  </Book>  \n  <Book id=\"bk102\">  \n    <Author>Garcia, Debra</Author>  \n    <Title>Midnight Rain</Title>  \n    <Genre>Fantasy</Genre>  \n    <Price>5.95</Price>  \n    <PublishDate>2000-12-16</PublishDate>  \n    <Description>A former architect battles corporate zombies,   \n      an evil sorceress, and her own childhood to become queen   \n      of the world.</Description>  \n  </Book>  \n</Catalog>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Parsing XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/parsing-xml.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,125],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: e2d337ad-8ac8-4671-b694-30e5ca1413b7","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[132,175],"content":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","linkify":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Load XML from a File (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,43]}]},{"pos":[176,309],"content":"This topic shows how to load XML from a URI by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Load%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> method.","source":"This topic shows how to load XML from a URI by using the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Load%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method."},{"pos":[318,325],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to load an XML document from a file.","pos":[329,397]},{"content":"The following example loads books.xml and outputs the XML tree to the console.","pos":[398,476]},{"pos":[483,663],"content":"This example uses the following XML document: <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>.","source":"This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Books (LINQ to XML)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/sample-xml-file-books-linq-to-xml.md)."},{"content":"This code produces the following output:","pos":[783,823]},{"pos":[1563,1571],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1575,1676],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Parsing XML (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/parsing-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Parsing XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/parsing-xml.md)"}]}
