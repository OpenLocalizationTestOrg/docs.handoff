starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)], a custom <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IMessageFilter.PreFilterMessage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation can safely filter messages when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.FilterMessage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called if the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IMessageFilter.PreFilterMessage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> implementation:  \n  \n-   Does one or both of the following:  \n  \n    -   Adds a message filter by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.AddMessageFilter%2A> method.  \n  \n    -   Removes a message filter by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.RemoveMessageFilter%2A>method. method.  \n  \n-   **And** pumps messages by calling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.DoEvents%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n## Impact  \n This change only affects Windows Forms apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)].  \n  \n For Windows Forms apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework, such implementations in some cases throw an <xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException> exception when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.FilterMessage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is called  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n If this change is undesirable, apps that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] or a later version can opt out of it by adding the following configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>  \n    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Windows.Forms.DontSupportReentrantFilterMessage=true\" />   \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n In addition, apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework but are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] or a later version can opt in to this behavior by adding the following configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>  \n    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.Windows.Forms.DontSupportReentrantFilterMessage=false\" />   \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Retargeting
