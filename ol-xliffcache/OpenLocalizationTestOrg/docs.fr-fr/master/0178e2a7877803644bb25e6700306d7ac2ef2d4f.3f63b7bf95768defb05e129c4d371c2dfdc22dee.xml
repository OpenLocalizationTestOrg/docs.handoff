The garbage collector currently uses three generations, numbered 0, 1, and 2, plus a special heap segment that is used for large objects. Objects whose size is larger than a particular value are stored in the large-object heap. Other allocated objects start out belonging to generation 0. All objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 0 are promoted to generation 1. Objects that exist after garbage collection occurs in generation 1 move into generation 2.  \n  \n The use of generations means that the garbage collector has to work with only a subset of the allocated objects at any one time.  \n  \n The `COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION` enumeration is used by the [COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION_RANGE](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/cor-prf-gc-generation-range-structure.md) structure.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Profiling Enumerations](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-enumerations.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,407],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"COR_PRF_GC_GENERATION Enumeration\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  -
