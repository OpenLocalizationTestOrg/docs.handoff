[!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] throws an exception if these methods are called in an override method.  \n  \n-   Override methods cannot be used to start, commit, or stop a transaction. The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> operation is performed under a transaction. An inner nested transaction can interfere with the outer transaction. Load override methods can start a transaction only after they determine that the operation is not being performed in a <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction>.  \n  \n-   Override methods are expected to follow the applicable optimistic concurrency mapping. The override method is expected to throw a <xref:System.Data.Linq.ChangeConflictException> when an optimistic concurrency conflict occurs. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] catches this exception so that you can correctly process the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A> option provided on <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A>.  \n  \n-   Create (`Insert`) and `Update` override methods are expected to flow back the values for database-generated columns to corresponding object members when the operation is successfully completed.  \n  \n     For example, if `Order.OrderID` is mapped to an identity column (*autoincrement* primary key), then the `InsertOrder()` override method must retrieve the database-generated ID and set the `Order.OrderID` member to that ID. Likewise, timestamp members must be updated to the database-generated timestamp values to make sure that the updated objects are consistent. Failure to propagate the database-generated values can cause an inconsistency between the database and the objects tracked by the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext>.  \n  \n-   It is the user's responsibility to invoke the correct dynamic API. For example, in the update override method, only the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.ExecuteDynamicUpdate%2A> can be called. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] does not detect or verify whether the invoked dynamic method matches the applicable operation. If an inapplicable method is called (for example, <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.ExecuteDynamicDelete%2A> for an object to be updated), the results are undefined.  \n  \n-   Finally, the overriding method is expected to perform the stated operation. The semantics of [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] operations such as eager loading, deferred loading, and <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A>) require the overrides to provide the stated service. For example, a load override that just returns an empty collection without checking the contents in the database will likely lead to inconsistent data.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Customizing Insert,
