If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times. Both issues can drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,144],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: ada4baa5-b60d-46b8-ad46-4d69f8d8a9fa","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","pos":[0,60]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[151,211],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","linkify":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"A prepare message retry was sent to an unresponsive participant.","pos":[212,276]},{"pos":[285,296],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Traced if the local Transaction Manager needed to resend a Prepare message to a subordinate participant because it did not receive a response in a given amount of time.","pos":[300,468]},{"pos":[477,492],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Investigate potential network or product issues that prevent the response from being delivered on time.","pos":[496,599]},{"content":"If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times.","pos":[601,711]},{"content":"Both issues can drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.","pos":[712,796]},{"pos":[805,813],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[817,890],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[893,1046],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[1049,1137],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
