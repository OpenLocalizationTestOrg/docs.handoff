This error is generated when you try to use empty parentheses to call something other than a method or delegate.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Remove the parentheses from the expression.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code generates CS1955 because the code is trying to invoke a field and a property by using the method call operator [()](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/invocation-operator.md). You cannot call a field or property, but you can access the value it stores by using the member access operator ( [.](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operator.md) ).  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs1955.cs  \nclass A  \n{  \n    public int x = 0;  \n    public int X  \n    {  \n        get { return x; }  \n        set { x = value; }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    static int Main()  \n    {  \n        A a = new A();  \n        a.x(); // CS1955  \n        a.X(); // CS1955  \n        // Try this line instead:  \n        // int num = a.x;  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1955\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1955\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1955\"\nms.assetid: 38a8542d-da53-4739-b807-46c8c077363c","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1955","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1955","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1955","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1955","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1955","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1955","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Non-invocable member 'name' cannot be used like a method.","pos":[194,251]},{"content":"Only methods and delegates can be invoked.","pos":[258,300]},{"content":"This error is generated when you try to use empty parentheses to call something other than a method or delegate.","pos":[301,413]},{"pos":[422,443],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the parentheses from the expression.","pos":[453,496]},{"pos":[505,512],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code generates CS1955 because the code is trying to invoke a field and a property by using the method call operator <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>()<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/invocation-operator.md)</ept>.","pos":[516,717],"source":"The following code generates CS1955 because the code is trying to invoke a field and a property by using the method call operator [()](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/invocation-operator.md)."},{"content":"You cannot call a field or property, but you can access the value it stores by using the member access operator ( <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>.<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operator.md)</ept>","pos":[718,904],"source":" You cannot call a field or property, but you can access the value it stores by using the member access operator ( [.](../../csharp/language-reference/operators/member-access-operator.md)"},{"content":").","pos":[905,907]}]}
