For example, one click usually selects an item, and a double-click edits the selected item. However, the Windows Forms click events do not easily accommodate a scenario where a click and a double-click perform incompatible actions, because an action tied to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseClick> event is performed before the action tied to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.DoubleClick> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDoubleClick> event. This topic demonstrates two solutions to this problem. One solution is to handle the double-click event and roll back the actions in the handling of the click event. In rare situations you may need to simulate click and double-click behavior by handling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event and by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DoubleClickTime%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DoubleClickSize%2A> properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class. You measure the time between clicks and if a second click occurs before the value of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DoubleClickTime%2A> is reached and the click is within a rectangle defined by <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DoubleClickSize%2A>, perform the double-click action; otherwise, perform the click action.  \n  \n### To roll back a click action  \n  \n-   Ensure that the control you are working with has standard double-click behavior. If not, enable the control with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.SetStyle%2A> method. Handle the double-click event and roll back the click action as well as the double-click action. The following code example demonstrates a how to create a custom button with double-click enabled, as well as how to roll back the click action in the double-click event handling code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ButtonDoubleClick#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ButtonDoubleClick/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ButtonDoubleClick#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ButtonDoubleClick/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n### To distinguish between clicks in the MouseDown event  \n  \n-   Handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event and determine the location and time span between clicks using the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> properties and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component. Perform the appropriate action depending on whether a click or double-click takes place.
