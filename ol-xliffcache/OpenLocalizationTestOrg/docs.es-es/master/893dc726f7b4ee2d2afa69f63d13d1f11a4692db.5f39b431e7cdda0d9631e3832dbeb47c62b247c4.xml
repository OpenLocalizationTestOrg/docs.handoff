When you create a new project, the wizards put some starter /// lines in for you. The processing of these comments has some restrictions:\n\n- The documentation must be well-formed XML. If the XML is not well-formed, a warning is generated and the documentation file will contain a comment that says that an error was encountered.\n\n- Developers are free to create their own set of tags. There is a recommended set of tags (see [Recommended tags for documentation comments](recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments.md)). Some of the recommended tags have special meanings:\n\n  - The \\<param> tag is used to describe parameters. If used, the compiler verifies that the parameter exists and that all parameters are described in the documentation. If the verification failed, the compiler issues a warning.\n\n  - The `cref` attribute can be attached to any tag to provide a reference to a code element. The compiler verifies that this code element exists. If the verification failed, the compiler issues a warning. The compiler respects any `using` statements when it looks for a type described in the `cref` attribute.\n\n  - The \\<summary> tag is used by IntelliSense inside Visual Studio to display additional information about a type or member.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > The XML file does not provide full information about the type and members (for example, it does not contain any type information). To get full information about a type or member, the documentation file must be used together with reflection on the actual type or member.\n\n## See also\n\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [/doc (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/doc-compiler-option.md)\n- [XML Documentation Comments](../../../csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/xml-documentation-comments.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,264],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use the XML documentation features - C# Programming Guide\"\nms.custom: seodec18\nms.date: 06/01/2018\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"XML documentation [C#]\"\n  - \"C# language, XML documentation features\"\nms.assetid: 8f33917b-9577-4c9a-818a-640dbbb0b399","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the XML documentation features - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"How to: Use the XML documentation features - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the XML documentation features - C# Programming Guide","pos":[0,65]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[271,313],"content":"How to: Use the XML documentation features","linkify":"How to: Use the XML documentation features","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the XML documentation features","pos":[0,42]}]},{"content":"The following sample provides a basic overview of a type that has been documented.","pos":[315,397]},{"pos":[402,409],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The example generates an .xml file with the following contents:","pos":[546,609]},{"pos":[3363,3381],"content":"Compiling the code","linkify":"Compiling the code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"To compile the example, type the following command line:","pos":[3383,3439]},{"pos":[3480,3595],"content":"This command creates the XML file <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>XMLsample.xml<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, which you can view in your browser or by using the TYPE command.","source":"This command creates the XML file *XMLsample.xml*, which you can view in your browser or by using the TYPE command."},{"pos":[3600,3618],"content":"Robust programming","linkify":"Robust programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"XML documentation starts with ///.","pos":[3620,3654]},{"content":"When you create a new project, the wizards put some starter /// lines in for you.","pos":[3655,3736]},{"content":"The processing of these comments has some restrictions:","pos":[3737,3792]},{"content":"The documentation must be well-formed XML.","pos":[3796,3838]},{"content":"If the XML is not well-formed, a warning is generated and the documentation file will contain a comment that says that an error was encountered.","pos":[3839,3983]},{"content":"Developers are free to create their own set of tags.","pos":[3987,4039]},{"content":"There is a recommended set of tags (see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Recommended tags for documentation comments<ept id=\"p1\">](recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments.md)</ept>).","pos":[4040,4175],"source":" There is a recommended set of tags (see [Recommended tags for documentation comments](recommended-tags-for-documentation-comments.md))."},{"content":"Some of the recommended tags have special meanings:","pos":[4176,4227]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>param&gt; tag is used to describe parameters.","pos":[4233,4281],"source":"The \\<param> tag is used to describe parameters."},{"content":"If used, the compiler verifies that the parameter exists and that all parameters are described in the documentation.","pos":[4282,4398]},{"content":"If the verification failed, the compiler issues a warning.","pos":[4399,4457]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`cref`</ph> attribute can be attached to any tag to provide a reference to a code element.","pos":[4463,4552],"source":"The `cref` attribute can be attached to any tag to provide a reference to a code element."},{"content":"The compiler verifies that this code element exists.","pos":[4553,4605]},{"content":"If the verification failed, the compiler issues a warning.","pos":[4606,4664]},{"content":"The compiler respects any <ph id=\"ph1\">`using`</ph> statements when it looks for a type described in the <ph id=\"ph2\">`cref`</ph> attribute.","pos":[4665,4769],"source":" The compiler respects any `using` statements when it looks for a type described in the `cref` attribute."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>summary&gt; tag is used by IntelliSense inside Visual Studio to display additional information about a type or member.","pos":[4775,4896],"source":"The \\<summary> tag is used by IntelliSense inside Visual Studio to display additional information about a type or member."},{"pos":[4904,5187],"content":"[!NOTE]\nThe XML file does not provide full information about the type and members (for example, it does not contain any type information).
