By declaring a constant, you assign a meaningful name to a value. Once a constant is declared, it cannot be modified or assigned a new value.  \n  \n You declare a constant within a procedure or in the declarations section of a module, class, or structure. Class or structure-level constants are `Private` by default, but may also be declared as `Public`, `Friend`, `Protected`, or `Protected Friend` for the appropriate level of code access.  \n  \n The constant must have a valid symbolic name (the rules are the same as those for creating variable names) and an expression composed of numeric or string constants and operators (but no function calls).  \n  \n[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](~/includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  \n  \n### To declare a constant  \n  \n-   Write a declaration that includes an access specifier, the `Const` keyword, and an expression, as in the following examples:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbEnumsTask#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbEnumsTask/VB/Class2.vb#8)]  \n  \n     When [Option Infer](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-infer-statement.md) is `Off` and [Option Strict](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement.md) is `On`, you must declare a constant explicitly by specifying a data type (`Boolean`, `Byte`, `Char`, `DateTime`, `Decimal`, `Double`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Short`, `Single`, or `String`).  \n  \n     When `Option Infer` is `On` or `Option Strict` is `Off`, you can declare a constant without specifying a data type with an `As` clause. The compiler determines the type of the constant from the type of the expression. For more information, see [Constant and Literal Data Types](constant-and-literal-data-types.md).  \n  \n### To declare a constant that has an explicitly stated data type  \n  \n-   Write a declaration that includes the `As` keyword and an explicit data type, as in the following examples:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbEnumsTask#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbEnumsTask/VB/Class2.vb#9)]  \n  \n     You can declare multiple constants on a single line, although your code is more readable if you declare only a single constant per line. If you declare multiple constants on a single line, they must all have the same access level (`Public`, `Private`, `Friend`, `Protected`, or `Protected Friend`).  \n  \n### To declare multiple constants on a single line  \n  \n-   Separate the declarations with a comma and a space, as in the following example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Public Const Four As Integer = 4, Five As Integer = 5, Six As Integer = 44  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Const Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/const-statement.md)\n- [Constant and Literal Data
