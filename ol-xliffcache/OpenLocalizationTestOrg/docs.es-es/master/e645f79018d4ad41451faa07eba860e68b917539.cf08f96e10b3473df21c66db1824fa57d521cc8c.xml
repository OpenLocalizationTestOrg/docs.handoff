This method also lets you set the final location of the program database (PDB) file.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nHRESULT Initialize2(  \n    [in] IUnknown     *emitter,  \n    [in] const WCHAR  *tempfilename,  \n    [in] IStream      *pIStream,  \n    [in] BOOL         fFullBuild,  \n    [in] const WCHAR  *finalfilename);  \n```  \n  \n## Parameters  \n `emitter`  \n [in] A pointer to the metadata emitter interface.  \n  \n `tempfilename`  \n [in] A pointer to a `WCHAR` that contains the file name to which the debugging symbols are written. If a file name is specified for a writer that does not use file names, this parameter is ignored.  \n  \n `pIStream`  \n [in] If specified, the symbol writer emits the symbols into the given <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream> rather than to the file specified in the `filename` parameter. The `pIStream` parameter is optional.  \n  \n `fFullBuild`  \n [in] `true` if this is a full rebuild; `false` if this is an incremental compilation.  \n  \n `finalfilename`  \n [in] A pointer to a `WCHAR` that is the path string to the final location of the PDB file.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n S_OK if the method succeeds; otherwise, E_FAIL or some other error code.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Header:** CorSym.idl, CorSym.h  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ISymUnmanagedWriter Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-interface.md)\n- [Initialize Method](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/diagnostics/isymunmanagedwriter-initialize-method.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,494],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  - \"ISymUnmanagedWriter.Initialize2\"\napi_location: \n  - \"diasymreader.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\n  - \"Initialize2 method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\nms.assetid: 93de56b6-4ae8-4cca-acdc-25a434623509\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"","nodes":[{"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","nodes":[{"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[501,540],"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","linkify":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","nodes":[{"content":"ISymUnmanagedWriter::Initialize2 Method","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Sets the metadata emitter interface with which this writer will be associated, and sets the output file name to which the debugging symbols will be written.","pos":[541,697]},{"content":"This method also lets you set the final location of the program database (PDB) file.","pos":[698,782]},{"pos":[791,797],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1029,1039],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to the metadata emitter interface.","pos":[1056,1105]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to a <ph id=\"ph1\">`WCHAR`</ph> that contains the file name to which the debugging symbols are written.","pos":[1130,1229],"source":"[in] A pointer to a `WCHAR` that contains the file name to which the debugging symbols are written."},{"content":"If a file name is specified for a writer that does not use file names, this parameter is ignored.","pos":[1230,1327]},{"content":"[in] If specified, the symbol writer emits the symbols into the given <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream&gt;</ph> rather than to the file specified in the <ph id=\"ph2\">`filename`</ph> parameter.","pos":[1348,1535],"source":"[in] If specified, the symbol writer emits the symbols into the given <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IStream> rather than to the file specified in the `filename` parameter."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`pIStream`</ph> parameter is optional.","pos":[1536,1573],"source":" The `pIStream` parameter is optional."},{"content":"[in] <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph> if this is a full rebuild;
