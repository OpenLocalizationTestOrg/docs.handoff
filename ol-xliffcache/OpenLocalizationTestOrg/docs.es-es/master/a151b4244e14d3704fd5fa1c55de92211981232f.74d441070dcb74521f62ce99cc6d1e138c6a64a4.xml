You can add several types of curves (ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines) to a path, but each curve is converted to a Bézier spline before it is stored in the path. Flattening a path consists of converting each Bézier spline in the path to a sequence of straight lines. The following illustration shows a path before and after flattening.  \n  \n ![Straight Lines and Curves](./media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"AboutGdip02_Art32A\")  \n  \n### To Flatten a Path  \n  \n-   call the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](lines-curves-and-shapes.md)\n- [Constructing and Drawing Paths](constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,364],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"graphics [Windows Forms], flattening curves into lines\"\n  - \"curves [Windows Forms], flattening\"\n  - \"GraphicsPath object\"\n  - \"paths [Windows Forms], flattening\"\n  - \"drawing [Windows Forms], flattening curves\"\nms.assetid: e654b8de-25f4-4735-9208-42e4514a589c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[371,412],"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","linkify":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> object stores a sequence of lines and Bézier splines.","pos":[413,513],"source":"A <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object stores a sequence of lines and Bézier splines."},{"content":"You can add several types of curves (ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines) to a path, but each curve is converted to a Bézier spline before it is stored in the path.","pos":[514,675]},{"content":"Flattening a path consists of converting each Bézier spline in the path to a sequence of straight lines.","pos":[676,780]},{"content":"The following illustration shows a path before and after flattening.","pos":[781,849]},{"pos":[856,937],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Straight Lines and Curves<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(./media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"</bpt>AboutGdip02_Art32A<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Straight Lines and Curves](./media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"AboutGdip02_Art32A\")"},{"pos":[947,964],"content":"To Flatten a Path","linkify":"To Flatten a Path","nodes":[{"content":"To Flatten a Path","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A&gt;</ph> method of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[974,1103],"source":"call the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A&gt;</ph> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path.","pos":[1104,1285],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path."},{"pos":[1294,1302],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1382,1437],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lines, Curves, and Shapes<ept id=\"p1\">](lines-curves-and-shapes.md)</ept>","source":"[Lines, Curves, and Shapes](lines-curves-and-shapes.md)"},{"pos":[1440,1507],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Constructing and Drawing Paths<ept id=\"p1\">](constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)</ept>","source":"[Constructing and Drawing Paths](constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)"}]}
