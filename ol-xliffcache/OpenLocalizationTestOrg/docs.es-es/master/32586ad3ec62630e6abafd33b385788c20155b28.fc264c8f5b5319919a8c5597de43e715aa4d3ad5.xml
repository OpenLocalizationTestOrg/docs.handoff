This topic outlines the tasks that are required to build a WCF application. For a working sample application, see [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  \n  \n## The Basic Tasks  \n The basic tasks to perform are, in order:  \n  \n1.  Define the service contract. A service contract specifies the signature of a service, the data it exchanges, and other contractually required data. For more information, see [Designing Service Contracts](../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-service-contracts.md).  \n  \n2.  Implement the contract. To implement a service contract, create a class that implements the contract and specify custom behaviors that the runtime should have. For more information, see [Implementing Service Contracts](../../../docs/framework/wcf/implementing-service-contracts.md).  \n  \n3.  Configure the service by specifying endpoints and other behavior information. For more information, see [Configuring Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuring-services.md).  \n  \n4.  Host the service. For more information, see [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md).  \n  \n5.  Build a client application. For more information, see [Building Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/building-clients.md).  \n  \n Although the topics in this section follow this order, some scenarios do not start at the beginning. For example, if you want to build a client for a pre-existing service, you start at step 5. Or if you are building a service that others will use, you may skip step 5.  \n  \n Once you are familiar with developing service contracts, you can also read [Introduction to Extensibility](../../../docs/framework/wcf/introduction-to-extensibility.md). If you have problems with your service, check [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md) to see whether others have the same or similar problems.
