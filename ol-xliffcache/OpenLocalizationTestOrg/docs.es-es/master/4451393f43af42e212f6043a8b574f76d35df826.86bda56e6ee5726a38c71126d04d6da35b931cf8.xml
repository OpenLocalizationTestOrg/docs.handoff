This topic steps through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity, and the custom activities from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic. The workflow models a number guessing game.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Each topic in the Getting Started tutorial depends on the previous topics. To complete this topic, you must first complete [How to: Create an Activity](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-an-activity.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To download a completed version of the tutorial, see [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF45) - Getting Started Tutorial](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248976).  \n  \n### To create the workflow  \n  \n1.  Right-click **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities** in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add**, **New Item**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Installed**, **Common Items** node, select **Workflow**. Select **Activity** from the **Workflow** list.  \n  \n3.  Type `SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow` into the **Name** box and click **Add**.  \n  \n4.  Drag a **Sequence** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it onto the **Drop activity here** label on the workflow design surface.  \n  \n### To create the workflow variables and arguments  \n  \n1.  Double-click **SequentialNumberGuessWorkflow.xaml** in **Solution Explorer** to display the workflow in the designer, if it is not already displayed.  \n  \n2.  Click **Arguments** in the lower-left side of the workflow designer to display the **Arguments** pane.  \n  \n3.  Click **Create Argument**.  \n  \n4.  Type `MaxNumber` into the **Name** box, select **In** from the **Direction** drop-down list, select **Int32** from the **Argument type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the argument.  \n  \n5.  Click **Create Argument**.  \n  \n6.  Type `Turns` into the **Name** box that is below the newly added `MaxNumber` argument, select **Out** from the **Direction** drop-down list, select **Int32** from the **Argument type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER.  \n  \n7.  Click **Arguments** in the lower-left side of the activity designer to close the **Arguments** pane.  \n  \n8.  Click **Variables** in the lower-left side of the workflow designer to display the **Variables** pane.  \n  \n9. Click **Create Variable**.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If no **Create Variable** box is displayed, click the **Sequence** activity on the workflow designer surface to select it.  \n  \n10. Type `Guess` into the **Name** box, select **Int32** from the **Variable type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the variable.  \n  \n11. Click **Create Variable**.  \n  \n12. Type `Target` into the **Name** box, select **Int32** from the **Variable type** drop-down list, and then press ENTER to save the variable.  \n  \n13. Click **Variables** in the lower-left side of the activity designer to close the **Variables** pane.  \n  \n### To add the workflow activities  \n  \n1.  Drag an **Assign** activity from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it onto the **Sequence** activity. Type `Target` into the **To** box and the following expression into the **Enter a C# expression** or **Enter a VB expression** box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    New System.Random().Next(1, MaxNumber + 1)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    new System.Random().Next(1, MaxNumber + 1)  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If the **Toolbox** window is not displayed, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu.  \n  \n2.  Drag a **DoWhile** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it on the workflow so that it is below the **Assign** activity.  \n  \n3.  Type the following expression into the **DoWhile** activity’s **Condition** property value box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Guess <> Target  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    Guess != Target  \n    ```  \n  \n     A <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> activity executes its child activities and then evaluates its <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile.Condition%2A>. If the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile.Condition%2A> evaluates to `True`, then the activities in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> execute again. In this example, the user’s guess is evaluated and the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.DoWhile> continues until the guess is correct.  \n  \n4.  Drag a **Prompt** activity from the **NumberGuessWorkflowActivities** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **DoWhile** activity from the previous step.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties Window**, type `\"EnterGuess\"` including the quotes into the **BookmarkName** property value box for the **Prompt** activity. Type `Guess` into the **Result** property value box, and type the following expression into the **Text** property box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    \"Please enter a number between 1 and \" & MaxNumber  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    \"Please enter a number between 1 and \" + MaxNumber  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If the **Properties Window** is not displayed, select **Properties Window** from the **View** menu.  \n  \n6.  Drag an **Assign** activity from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **DoWhile** activity so that it follows the **Prompt** activity.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  When you drop the **Assign** activity, note how the workflow designer automatically adds a **Sequence** activity to contain both the **Prompt** activity and the newly added **Assign** activity.  \n  \n7.  Type `Turns` into the **To** box and `Turns + 1` into the **Enter a C# expression** or **Enter a VB expression** box.  \n  \n8.  Drag an **If** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **Sequence** activity so that it follows the newly added **Assign** activity.  \n  \n9. Type the following expression into the **If** activity’s **Condition** property value box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Guess <> Target  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    Guess != Target  \n    ```  \n  \n10. Drag another **If** activity from the **Control Flow** section of the **Toolbox** and drop it in the **Then** section of the first **If** activity.  \n  \n11. Type the following expression into the newly added **If** activity’s **Condition** property value box.  \n  \n    ```vb-c#  \n    Guess < Target  \n    ```  \n  \n12. Drag two **WriteLine** activities from the **Primitives** section of the **Toolbox** and drop them so that one is in the **Then** section of the newly added **If** activity, and one is in the **Else** section.  \n  \n13. Click the **WriteLine** activity in the **Then** section to select it, and type the following expression into the **Text** property value box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    \"Your guess is too low.\"  \n    ```  \n  \n14. Click the **WriteLine** activity in the **Else** section to select it, and type the following expression into the **Text** property value box.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    \"Your guess is too high.\"  \n    ```  \n  \n     The following example illustrates the completed workflow.  \n  \n     ![Completed Sequential Workflow](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/media/wfsequentialgettingstartedtutorialcomplete.JPG \"WFSequentialGettingStartedTutorialComplete\")  \n  \n### To build the workflow  \n  \n1.
