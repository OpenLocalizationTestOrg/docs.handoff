The supported views are determined by the control developer and are specific to each control.  \n  \n<a name=\"Implementation_Guidelines_and_Conventions\"></a>   \n## Implementation Guidelines and Conventions  \n When implementing the Multiple View control pattern, note the following guidelines and conventions:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider> should also be implemented on a container that manages the current view if it is different from a control that provides the current view. For example, Windows Explorer contains a List control for the current folder content while the view for the control is managed from the Windows Explorer application.  \n  \n-   A control that is able to sort its content is not considered to support multiple views.  \n  \n-   The collection of views must be identical across instances.  \n  \n-   View names must be suitable for use in Text to Speech, Braille, and other human-readable applications.  \n  \n<a name=\"Required_Members_for_IMultipleViewProvider\"></a>   \n## Required Members for IMultipleViewProvider  \n The following properties and methods are required for implementing IMultipleViewProvider.  \n  \n|Required members|Member type|Notes|  \n|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.CurrentView%2A>|Property|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetSupportedViews%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A>|Method|None|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A>|Method|None|  \n  \n There are no events associated with this control pattern.  \n  \n<a name=\"Exceptions\"></a>   \n## Exceptions  \n Provider must throw the following exceptions.  \n  \n|Exception type|Condition|  \n|--------------------|---------------|  \n|<xref:System.ArgumentException>|When either <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.SetCurrentView%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Automation.Provider.IMultipleViewProvider.GetViewName%2A> is called with a parameter that is not a member of the supported views collection.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [UI Automation Control Patterns Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-overview.md)   \n [Support Control Patterns in a UI Automation Provider](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/support-control-patterns-in-a-ui-automation-provider.md)   \n [UI Automation Control Patterns for Clients](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-control-patterns-for-clients.md)   \n [UI Automation Tree Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-tree-overview.md)   \n [Use Caching in UI Automation](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-caching-in-ui-automation.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,88],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,76]}]},{"pos":[532,591],"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","linkify":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","nodes":[{"content":"Implementing the UI Automation MultipleView Control Pattern","pos":[0,59]}]},{"pos":[594,1056],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
