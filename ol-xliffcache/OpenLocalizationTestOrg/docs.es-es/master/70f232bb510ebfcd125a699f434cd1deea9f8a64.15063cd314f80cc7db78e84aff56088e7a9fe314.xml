For more information, see [Data Services Providers](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-services-providers-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example defines a data model that includes `Orders` and `Items`. The entity container class `OrderItemData` has two public methods that return <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> interfaces. These interfaces are the entity sets of the `Orders` and `Items` entity types. An `Order` can include multiple `Items`, so the `Orders` entity type has an `Items` navigation property that returns a collection of `Items` objects. The `OrderItemData` entity container class is the generic type of the <xref:System.Data.Services.DataService%601> class from which the `OrderItems` data service is derived.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Because this example demonstrates an in-memory data provider and changes are not persisted outside of the current object instances, there is no benefit derived from implementing the <xref:System.Data.Services.IUpdatable> interface. For an example that implements the <xref:System.Data.Services.IUpdatable> interface, see [How to: Create a Data Service Using a LINQ to SQL Data Source](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-linq-to-sql-wcf.md).  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Reflection Provider#CustomIQueryable](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria reflection provider/cs/orderitems.svc.cs#customiqueryable)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Reflection Provider#CustomIQueryable](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria reflection provider/vb/orderitems.svc.vb#customiqueryable)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Create a Data Service Using a LINQ to SQL Data Source](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-linq-to-sql-wcf.md)\n- [Data Services Providers](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/data-services-providers-wcf-data-services.md)\n- [How to: Create a Data Service Using an ADO.NET Entity Framework Data Source](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-an-adonet-ef-data-wcf.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,254],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Data Service Using the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
