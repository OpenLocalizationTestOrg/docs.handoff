By default, [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] translates your actions to SQL and submits the changes to the database.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] offers maximum flexibility in manipulating and persisting changes that you made to your objects. As soon as entity objects are available (either by retrieving them through a query or by constructing them anew), you can change them as typical objects in your application. That is, you can change their values, you can add them to your collections, and you can remove them from your collections. [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] tracks your changes and is ready to transmit them back to the database when you call <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.SubmitChanges%2A>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../../../../includes/vbtecdlinq-md.md)] does not support or recognize cascade-delete operations. If you want to delete a row in a table that has constraints against it, you must either set the `ON DELETE CASCADE` rule in the foreign-key constraint in the database, or use your own code to first delete the child objects that prevent the parent object from being deleted. Otherwise, an exception is thrown. For more information, see [How to: Delete Rows From the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/how-to-delete-rows-from-the-database.md).  \n  \n The following excerpts use the `Customer` and `Order` classes from the Northwind sample database.
