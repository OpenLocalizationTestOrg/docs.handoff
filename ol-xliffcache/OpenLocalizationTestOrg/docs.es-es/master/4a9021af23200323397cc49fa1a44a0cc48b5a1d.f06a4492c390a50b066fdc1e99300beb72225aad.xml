For example, you can access the application's culture-specific resource files. The following example sets the icon of the form to the icon named `Form1Icon` stored in the application's resource file.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnMy#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMy/VB/Class1.vb#7)]  \n  \n The `My.Resources` object exposes only global resources. It does not provide access to resource files associated with forms. You must access the form resources from the form.  \n  \n Similarly, the `My.Settings` object provides access to the application's settings and allows you to dynamically store and retrieve property settings and other information for your application. For more information, see [My.Resources Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-resources-object.md) and [My.Settings Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [My.Resources Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-resources-object.md)\n- [My.Settings Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-settings-object.md)\n- [Accessing Application Settings](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,424],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Rapid Application Development with My.Resources and My.Settings (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
