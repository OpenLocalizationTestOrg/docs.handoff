Consequently, the transaction was aborted.  \n  \n## Description  \n Traced if a Replay message is received while a Durable participant is still Preparing. This is an illegal message for this state and the transaction is going to be aborted.  \n  \n## Troubleshooting  \n Receiving this error can indiate that a Durable participant (including Subordinate TransactionManagers) has recovered from failure, however it is unsure of the transaction outcome and request its status.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,108],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,96]}]},{"pos":[406,485],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","linkify":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"The WS-AT protocol service received a Replay message from a durable participant, which did not respond to Prepare.","pos":[486,600]},{"content":"Consequently, the transaction was aborted.","pos":[601,643]},{"pos":[652,663],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Traced if a Replay message is received while a Durable participant is still Preparing.","pos":[667,753]},{"content":"This is an illegal message for this state and the transaction is going to be aborted.","pos":[754,839]},{"pos":[848,863],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Receiving this error can indiate that a Durable participant (including Subordinate TransactionManagers) has recovered from failure, however it is unsure of the transaction outcome and request its status.","pos":[867,1070]},{"pos":[1079,1087],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1091,1165],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1168,1323],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1326,1415],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
