See the Remarks section for the distinction between catch-up and non-catch-up events.|  \n|`CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_DEBUGGER_LAUNCH`|The managed event that is pending is a <xref:System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Launch%2A?displayProperty=fullName> request.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Catch-up events include process, application domain, assembly, module, and thread creation notifications that bring the debugger up to the current state after it has attached to a process. Non-catch-up events, which are indicated by the `CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_PENDING` flag, include all other debugger events, such as exceptions and managed debugging assistant (MDA) notifications.  \n  \n The `CLR_DEBUGGING_MANAGED_EVENT_DEBUGGER_LAUNCH` flag enables the runtime to differentiate between a terminating exception and a request to attach a managed debugger that can be canceled.  \n
