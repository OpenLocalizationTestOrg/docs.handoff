For more information, see [Differences Between the Windows Forms DataGridView and DataGrid Controls](differences-between-the-windows-forms-datagridview-and-datagrid-controls.md).  \n  \n After you have created a Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> using the design-time features, you may also wish to dynamically change elements of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object of the grid at run time. This can include changes to either individual values of the table or changing which data source is bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control. Changes to individual values are done through the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object, not the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control.  \n  \n### To change data programmatically  \n  \n1.  Specify the desired table from the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> object and the desired row and field from the table and set the cell equal to the new value.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  To specify the first table of the <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or the first row of the table, use 0.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to change the second entry of the first row of the first table of a dataset by clicking `Button1`. The <xref:System.Data.DataSet> (`ds`) and Tables (`0` and `1`) were previously created.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Protected Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n       ds.tables(0).rows(0)(1) = \"NewEntry\"  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       ds.Tables[0].Rows[0][1]=\"NewEntry\";  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:   \n       void button1_Click(System::Object^ sender, System::EventArgs^ e)  \n       {  \n          dataSet1->Tables[0]->Rows[0][1] = \"NewEntry\";  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     (Visual C#, [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->button1->Click +=  \n       gcnew System::EventHandler(this, &Form1::button1_Click);  \n    ```  \n  \n     At run time you can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control to a different data source. For example, you may have several [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] data controls, each connected to a different database.  \n  \n### To change the DataSource programmatically  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to the name of the data source and table you want to bind to.  \n  \n     The following example shows how to change the date source using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method to an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] data control (adoPubsAuthors) that is connected to the Authors table in the Pubs database.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub ResetSource()  \n       DataGrid1.SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, \"Authors\")  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void ResetSource()  \n    {  \n       DataGrid1.SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, \"Authors\");  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void ResetSource()  \n       {  \n          dataGrid1->SetDataBinding(adoPubsAuthors, \"Authors\");  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [ADO.NET DataSets](../../data/adonet/ado-net-datasets.md)\n- [How to: Delete or Hide Columns in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control](how-to-delete-or-hide-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagrid-control.md)\n- [How to: Add Tables and Columns to the Windows Forms DataGrid Control](how-to-add-tables-and-columns-to-the-windows-forms-datagrid-control.md)\n- [How to: Bind the Windows Forms DataGrid Control to a Data Source](how-to-bind-the-windows-forms-datagrid-control-to-a-data-source.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,414],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"DataGrid control [Windows Forms], dynamically changing at run time\"\n  - \"DataGrid control [Windows Forms], data binding\"\n  - \"cells [Windows Forms], changing DataGrid cell values\"\nms.assetid: 0c7a6d00-30de-416e-8223-0a81ddb4c1f8","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","nodes":[{"pos":[0,79],"content":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","pos":[0,79]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[421,500],"content":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","linkify":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change Displayed Data at Run Time in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control","pos":[0,79]}]},{"pos":[503,963],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.
