It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value. Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned.  \n  \n You can test a reference variable with the [GetType Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md) operator to see if its run-time type is <xref:System.Void>, but you cannot use <xref:System.Void> in any other context.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31422  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  If you want to compare the run-time type of a variable to <xref:System.Void>, use the `GetType` operator.  \n  \n2.  Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Void>\n- [GetType Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,215],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31422\"\n  - \"vbc31422\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31422\"\nms.assetid: 84e45194-cb46-41f6-8420-a1498baeaaba","nodes":[{"content":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","nodes":[{"content":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[222,276],"content":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","linkify":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","nodes":[{"content":"'System.Void' can only be used in a GetType expression","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[277,441],"content":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration uses <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> as the type of a variable, procedure parameter, function return, or type argument.","source":"An expression in an assignment statement or a declaration uses <xref:System.Void> as the type of a variable, procedure parameter, function return, or type argument."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++.","pos":[448,586],"source":"The <xref:System.Void> structure is a specialized type used internally by the .NET Framework and particularly by Visual C# and Visual C++."},{"content":"It represents a return value type for a method that does not return a value.","pos":[587,663]},{"content":"Visual Basic uses a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Sub`</ph> procedure when a value is not returned and a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Function`</ph> procedure when a value is returned.","pos":[664,781],"source":" Visual Basic uses a `Sub` procedure when a value is not returned and a `Function` procedure when a value is returned."},{"pos":[788,1038],"content":"You can test a reference variable with the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetType Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md)</ept> operator to see if its run-time type is <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>, but you cannot use <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph> in any other context.","source":"You can test a reference variable with the [GetType Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md) operator to see if its run-time type is <xref:System.Void>, but you cannot use <xref:System.Void> in any other context."},{"pos":[1045,1066],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31422","source":"**Error ID:** BC31422"},{"pos":[1075,1096],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1106,1211],"content":"If you want to compare the run-time type of a variable to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>, use the <ph id=\"ph2\">`GetType`</ph> operator.","source":"If you want to compare the run-time type of a variable to <xref:System.Void>, use the `GetType` operator."},{"pos":[1221,1345],"content":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Void&gt;</ph>, remove the reference to it altogether.","source":"Unless you have a particular reason to compare a run-time type to <xref:System.Void>, remove the reference to it altogether."},{"pos":[1354,1362],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1387,1474],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>GetType Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[GetType Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/gettype-operator.md)"}]}
