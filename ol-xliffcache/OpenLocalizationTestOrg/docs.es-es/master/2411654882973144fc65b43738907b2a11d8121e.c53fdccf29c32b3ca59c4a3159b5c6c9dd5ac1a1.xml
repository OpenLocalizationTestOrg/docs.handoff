This service communicates asynchronously with the `CreditCheckService` to decide whether the credit application is valid.  \n  \n Client  \n The client communicates synchronously with the `RentalApprovalService` to know whether the credit is approved.  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Right-click the **AsynchronousCommunication** solution and select **Properties**.  \n  \n2.  In **Common Properties**, select **Startup Project**, and select **Multiple Startup Projects**.  \n  \n3.  Move **RentalApprovalService** to the first position in the list, followed by **CreditCheckService**, followed by **Client**. Set the **Start** action on all three projects.  \n  \n4.  Click **OK**, and press F5 to run the sample.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine.
