All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `true` if the two collections have common elements; otherwise, `false`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n OVERLAPS provides functionally equivalent tothe following:  \n  \n `EXISTS ( expression INTERSECT expression )`  \n  \n OVERLAPS is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right.

The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.
