This sample is based on the [Getting Started](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/getting-started-sample.md) that implements a calculator service. In this sample, the client is a console application (.exe) and the service is hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The client's `Endpoint` property allows access to information about the service endpoint that the client is communicating with—including address, binding and contract information. The client's `InnerChannel` property is an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.IClientChannel> that allows access to information about the underlying channel, such as its state and session identifier.  \n  \n```  \n// Create a client.  \nCalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();  \n...  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Client - endpoint:  \" + client.Endpoint.Address);  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Client - binding:  \" + client.Endpoint.Binding.Name);  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Client - contract: \" + client.Endpoint.Contract.Name);  \n  \nIClientChannel channel = client.InnerChannel;  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Client channel - state: \" + channel.State);  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Client channel - session identifier: \" + channel.SessionId);  \n  \n//Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources.  \nclient.Close();  \n  \n```  \n  \n When you run the sample, the operation requests and responses are displayed in the client console window. Press ENTER in the client window to shut down the client.  \n  \n```  \n  \nAdd(100,15.99) = 115.99  \nSubtract(145,76.54) = 68.46  \nMultiply(9,81.25) = 731.25  \nDivide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714  \n  \nClient - endpoint:  http://localhost/servicemodelsamples/service.svc  \nClient - binding:  WSHttpBinding  \nClient - contract: ICalculator  \nClient channel - state: Opened  \nClient channel - session identifier: urn:uuid:ae16fbc4-2964-4e87-9fb1-c5aa78fc567e  \n  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
