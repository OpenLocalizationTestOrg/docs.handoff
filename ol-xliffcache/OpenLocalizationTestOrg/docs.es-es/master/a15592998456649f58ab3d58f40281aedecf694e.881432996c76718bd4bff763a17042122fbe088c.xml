These dangerous permissions should be given only to trustworthy code, and then only as necessary. There is usually no defense against malicious code if it is granted these permissions.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)], there have been important changes to the .NET Framework security model and terminology. For more information about these changes, see [Security Changes](../../../docs/framework/security/security-changes.md).  \n  \n The dangerous permissions are explained in the following table.  \n  \n|Permission|Potential risk|  \n|----------------|--------------------|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission>||  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag>|Allows managed code to call into unmanaged code, which is often dangerous.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag>|Without verification, the code can do anything.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag>|Invalidated evidence can fool security policy.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag>|The ability to modify security policy can disable security.|  \n|<xref:System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag>|The use of serialization can circumvent accessibility mechanisms.
