Typically, the statements of a `finally` block run when control leaves a `try` statement. The transfer of control can occur as a result of normal execution, of execution of a `break`, `continue`, `goto`, or `return` statement, or of propagation of an exception out of the `try` statement.  \n  \n Within a handled exception, the associated `finally` block is guaranteed to be run. However, if the exception is unhandled, execution of the `finally` block is dependent on how the exception unwind operation is triggered. That, in turn, is dependent on how your computer is set up. For more information, see [Unhandled Exception Processing in the CLR](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=128371).  \n  \n Usually, when an unhandled exception ends an application, whether or not the `finally` block is run is not important. However, if you have statements in a `finally` block that must be run even in that situation, one solution is to add a `catch` block to the `try`-`finally` statement. Alternatively, you can catch the exception that might be thrown in the `try` block of a `try`-`finally` statement higher up the call stack. That is, you can catch the exception in the method that calls the method that contains the `try`-`finally` statement, or in the method that calls that method, or in any method in the call stack. If the exception is not caught, execution of the `finally` block depends on whether the operating system chooses to trigger an exception unwind operation.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, an invalid conversion statement causes a `System.InvalidCastException` exception. The exception is unhandled.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsExceptions#4](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/try-finally_1.cs)]  \n  \n In the following example, an exception from the `TryCast` method is caught in a method farther up the call stack.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsExceptions#6](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/try-finally_2.cs)]  \n  \n For more information about `finally`, see [try-catch-finally](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch-finally.md).  \n  \n C# also contains the [using statement](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement.md), which provides similar functionality for <xref:System.IDisposable> objects in a convenient syntax.  \n  \n## C# Language Specification  \n
