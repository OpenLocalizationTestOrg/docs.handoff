In fact, some query operations can only be expressed in method syntax. For more information about the difference between query syntax and method syntax, see [Query Syntax and Method Syntax in LINQ](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to use a lambda expression in a method-based query by using the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A?displayProperty=fullName> standard query operator. Note that the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A> method in this example has an input parameter of the delegate type <xref:System.Func%601> and that delegate takes an integer as input and returns a Boolean. The lambda expression can be converted to that delegate. If this were a [!INCLUDE[vbtecdlinq](../../../csharp/includes/vbtecdlinq_md.md)] query that used the <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Where%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, the parameter type would be an `Expression<Func\\<int,bool>>` but the lambda expression would look exactly the same. For more information on the Expression type, see <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#1](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-lambda-expressions-in-a-query_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to use a lambda expression in a method call of a query expression. The lambda is necessary because the <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum%2A> standard query operator cannot be invoked by using query syntax.  \n  \n The query first groups the students according to their grade level, as defined in the `GradeLevel` enum. Then for each group it adds the total scores for each student. This requires two `Sum` operations. The inner `Sum` calculates the total score for each student, and the outer `Sum` keeps a running, combined total for all students in the group.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#2](../../../csharp/programming-guide/arrays/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-use-lambda-expressions-in-a-query_2.cs)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To run this code, copy and paste the method into the `StudentClass` that is provided in [How to: Query a Collection of Objects](../../../csharp/programming-guide/linq-query-expressions/how-to-query-a-collection-of-objects.md) and call it from the `Main` method.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Lambda Expressions](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions.md)   \n [Expression
