For the data type, you specify either `Object` (that is, the [Object Data Type](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/object-data-type.md)) or a more specific class from which the object is to be created.  \n  \n Declaring a variable as `Object` is the same as declaring it as <xref:System.Object?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n When you declare a variable with a specific object class, it can access all the methods and properties exposed by that class and the classes from which it inherits. If you declare the variable with <xref:System.Object>, it can access only the members of the <xref:System.Object> class, unless you turn `Option Strict Off` to allow late binding.  \n  \n## Declaration Syntax  \n Use the following syntax to declare an object variable:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim variablename As [New] { objectclass | Object }  \n```  \n  \n You can also specify [Public](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/public.md), [Protected](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/protected.md), [Friend](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/friend.md), `Protected Friend`, [Private](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md), [Shared](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md), or [Static](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/static.md) in the declaration. The following example declarations are valid:  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate objA As Object  \nStatic objB As System.Windows.Forms.Label  \nDim objC As System.OperatingSystem  \n```  \n  \n## Late Binding and Early Binding  \n Sometimes the specific class is unknown until your code runs. In this case, you must declare the object variable with the `Object` data type. This creates a general reference to any type of object, and the specific class is assigned at run time. This is called *late binding*. Late binding requires additional execution time. It also limits your code to the methods and properties of the class you have most recently assigned to it. This can cause run-time errors if your code attempts to access members of a different class.  \n  \n When you know the specific class at compile time, you should declare the object variable to be of that class. This is called *early binding*. Early binding improves performance and guarantees your code access to all the methods and properties of the specific class. In the preceding example declarations, if variable `objA` uses only objects of class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label?displayProperty=nameWithType>, you should specify `As System.Windows.Forms.Label` in its declaration.  \n  \n### Advantages of Early Binding  \n Declaring an object variable as a specific class gives you several advantages:  \n  \n-   Automatic type checking  \n  \n-   Guaranteed access to all members of the specific class  \n  \n-   Microsoft IntelliSense support in the Code Editor  \n  \n-   Improved readability of your code  \n  \n-   Fewer errors in your code  \n  \n-   Errors caught at compile time rather than run time  \n  \n-   Faster code execution  \n  \n## Access to Object Variable Members  \n When `Option Strict` is turned `On`, an object variable can access only the methods and properties of the class with which you declare it. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Option statements must precede all other source file lines.  \nOption Strict On  \n' Imports statement must precede all declarations in the source file.  \nImports System.Windows.Forms  \nPublic Sub accessMembers()  \n    Dim p As Object  \n    Dim q As System.Windows.Forms.Label  \n    p = New System.Windows.Forms.Label  \n    q = New System.Windows.Forms.Label  \n    Dim j, k As Integer  \n    ' The following statement generates a compiler ERROR.  \n    j = p.Left  \n    ' The following statement retrieves the left edge of the label in pixels.  \n    k = q.Left  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n In this example, `p` can use only the members of the <xref:System.Object> class itself, which do not include the `Left` property. On the other hand, `q` was declared to be of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label>, so it can use all the methods and properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label> class in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms> namespace.  \n  \n## Flexibility of Object Variables  \n When working with objects in an inheritance hierarchy, you have a choice of which class to use for declaring your object variables. In making this choice, you must balance flexibility of object assignment against access to members of a class. For example, consider the inheritance hierarchy that leads to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form?displayProperty=nameWithType> class:  \n  \n <xref:System.Object>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.MarshalByRefObject>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.ComponentModel.Component>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl>  \n  \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>  \n  \n Suppose your application defines a form class called `specialForm`, which inherits from class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>. You can declare an object variable that refers specifically to `specialForm`, as the following example shows.  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Class specialForm  \n    Inherits System.Windows.Forms.Form  \n    ' Insert code defining methods and properties of specialForm.  \nEnd Class  \nDim nextForm As New specialForm  \n```  \n  \n The declaration in the preceding example limits the variable `nextForm` to objects of class `specialForm`, but it also makes all the methods and properties of `specialForm` available to `nextForm`, as well as all the members of all the classes from which `specialForm` inherits.  \n  \n You can make an object variable more general by declaring it to be of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>, as the following example shows.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim anyForm As System.Windows.Forms.Form  \n```  \n  \n The declaration in the preceding example lets you assign any form in your application to `anyForm`. However, although `anyForm` can access all the members of class <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form>, it cannot use any of the additional methods or properties defined for specific forms such as `specialForm`.  \n  \n All the members of a base class are available to derived classes, but the additional members of a derived class are unavailable to the base class.  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
