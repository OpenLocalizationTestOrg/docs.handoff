See [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md).  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40031  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you have control over the source code, change the member name so that it does not begin with an underscore.  \n  \n-   If you require that the member name remain unchanged, remove the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`. You can still mark the assembly as `<CLSCompliant(True)>`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Declared Element Names](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/declared-element-names.md)   \n [Visual Basic Naming Conventions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/naming-conventions.md)   \n [\\<PAVE OVER> Writing CLS-Compliant Code](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/4c705105-69a2-4e5e-b24e-0633bc32c7f3)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,73],"content":"Name &lt;membername&gt;
