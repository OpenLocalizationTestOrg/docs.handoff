If it doesn't exist, it creates the file and writes \"Hello Isolated Storage\" to the file. If TestStore.txt already exists, the example code reads from the file.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/cs/source5.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/vb/source5.vb#5)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFile>   \n <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream>   \n <xref:System.IO.FileMode?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.IO.FileAccess?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.IO.StreamReader?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [File and Stream I-O](../../../docs/standard/io/index.md)   \n [Isolated Storage](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,80],"content":"How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[797,848],"content":"How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage","linkify":"How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Read and Write to Files in Isolated Storage","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"To read from, or write to, a file in an isolated store, use an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream&gt;</ph> object with a stream reader (<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.StreamReader&gt;</ph> object) or stream writer (<ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.IO.StreamWriter&gt;</ph> object).","pos":[849,1094],"source":"To read from, or write to, a file in an isolated store, use an <xref:System.IO.IsolatedStorage.IsolatedStorageFileStream> object with a stream reader (<xref:System.IO.StreamReader> object) or stream writer (<xref:System.IO.StreamWriter> object)."},{"pos":[1103,1110],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example obtains an isolated store and checks whether a file named TestStore.txt exists in the store.","pos":[1114,1233]},{"content":"If it doesn't exist, it creates the file and writes \"Hello Isolated Storage\" to the file.","pos":[1234,1323]},{"content":"If TestStore.txt already exists, the example code reads from the file.","pos":[1324,1394]},{"pos":[1401,1678],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-csharp</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/cs/source5.cs#5)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept> <bpt id=\"p3\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p4\">[</bpt>Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5<ept id=\"p4\">](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/vb/source5.vb#5)</ept><ept id=\"p3\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-csharp[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/cs/source5.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.IsolatedStorage#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.isolatedstorage/vb/source5.vb#5)]"},{"pos":[1687,1695],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>File and Stream I-O<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/io/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[2048,2107],"source":" [File and Stream I-O](../../../docs/standard/io/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Isolated Storage<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)</ept>","pos":[2110,2176],"source":" [Isolated Storage](../../../docs/standard/io/isolated-storage.md)"}]}
