For example, you can instantiate the collection in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] and specify the collection as a resource, as shown here:  \n  \n```xaml  \n<Window  \n  xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"  \n  xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"  \n  xmlns:c=\"clr-namespace:SDKSample\"  \n  x:Class=\"SDKSample.Window1\"  \n  Width=\"400\"  \n  Height=\"280\"  \n  Title=\"MultiBinding Sample\">  \n  \n  <Window.Resources>  \n    <c:NameList x:Key=\"NameListData\"/>  \n  \n...  \n  \n</Window.Resources>  \n  \n```  \n  \n You can then bind to the collection:  \n  \n```xaml  \n<ListBox Width=\"200\"  \n         ItemsSource=\"{Binding Source={StaticResource NameListData}}\"  \n         ItemTemplate=\"{StaticResource NameItemTemplate}\"  \n         IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem=\"True\"/>  \n  \n```  \n  \n The definition of `NameItemTemplate` is not shown here.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The objects in your collection must satisfy the requirements described in the [Binding Sources Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/binding-sources-overview.md). In particular, if you are using <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Data.BindingMode> (for example, you want your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] to update when the source properties change dynamically), you must implement a suitable property changed notification mechanism such as the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> interface.  \n  \n For more information, see the Binding to Collections section in the [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Sort Data in a View](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-sort-data-in-a-view.md)   \n [Filter Data in a View](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-filter-data-in-a-view.md)   \n [Sort and Group Data Using a View in XAML](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-sort-and-group-data-using-a-view-in-xaml.md)   \n [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md)   \n [How-to Topics](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-how-to-topics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,79],"content":"How to: Create and Bind to an ObservableCollection | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create and Bind to an ObservableCollection | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]},{"pos":[512,562],"content":"How to: Create and Bind to an ObservableCollection","linkify":"How to: Create and Bind to an ObservableCollection","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create and Bind to an ObservableCollection","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to create and bind to a collection that derives from the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601&gt;</ph> class, which is a collection class that provides notifications when items get added or removed.","pos":[563,801],"source":"This example shows how to create and bind to a collection that derives from the <xref:System.Collections.ObjectModel.ObservableCollection%601> class, which is a collection class that provides notifications when items get added or removed."},{"pos":[810,817],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[821,895],"content":"The following example shows the implementation of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`NameList`</ph> collection:","source":"The following example shows the implementation of a `NameList` collection:"},{"content":"You can make the collection available for binding the same way you would with other <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)]</ph> objects, as described in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Make Data Available for Binding in XAML<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-make-data-available-for-binding-in-xaml.md)</ept>.","pos":[2897,3203],"source":"You can make the collection available for binding the same way you would with other [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_clr](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-clr-md.md)] objects, as described in [Make Data Available for Binding in XAML](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/how-to-make-data-available-for-binding-in-xaml.md)."},{"content":"For example, you can instantiate the collection in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> and specify the collection as a resource, as shown here:","pos":[3204,3383],"source":" For example, you can instantiate the collection in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] and specify the collection as a resource, as shown here:"},{"content":"You can then bind to the collection:","pos":[3788,3824]},{"pos":[4058,4113],"content":"The definition of <ph id=\"ph1\">`NameItemTemplate`</ph> is not shown here.","source":"The definition of `NameItemTemplate` is not shown here."},{"pos":[4121,4714],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The objects in your collection must satisfy the requirements described in the [Binding Sources Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/binding-sources-overview.md).
