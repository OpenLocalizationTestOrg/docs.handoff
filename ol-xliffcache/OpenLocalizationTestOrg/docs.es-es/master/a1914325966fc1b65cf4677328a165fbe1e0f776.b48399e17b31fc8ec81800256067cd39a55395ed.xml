In addition, the runtime and the .NET Framework provide useful classes and services that facilitate the use of cryptography and role-based security.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Security Changes](../../../docs/framework/security/security-changes.md)  \n Describes important changes to the .NET Framework security system.  \n  \n [Key Security Concepts](../../../docs/standard/security/key-security-concepts.md)  \n Provides an overview of common language runtime security features. This section is of interest to developers and system administrators.  \n  \n [Role-Based Security](../../../docs/standard/security/role-based-security.md)  \n Describes how to interact with role-based security in your code. This section is of interest to developers.  \n  \n [Cryptography Model](../../../docs/standard/security/cryptography-model.md)  \n Provides an overview of cryptographic services provided by the .NET Framework. This section is of interest to developers.  \n  \n [Secure Coding Guidelines](../../../docs/standard/security/secure-coding-guidelines.md)  \n Describes some of the best practices for creating reliable .NET Framework applications. This section is of interest to developers.  \n  \n [Secure Coding Guidelines for Unmanaged Code](../../../docs/framework/security/secure-coding-guidelines-for-unmanaged-code.md)  \n Describes some of the best practices and security concerns when calling unmanaged code.  \n  \n [Windows Identity Foundation](../../../docs/framework/security/index.md)  \n Describes how you can implement claims-based identity in your applications.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Development Guide](../../../docs/framework/development-guide.md)  \n Provides a guide to all key technology areas and tasks for application development, including creating, configuring, debugging, securing, and deploying your application, and information about dynamic programming, interoperability, extensibility, memory management, and threading.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"Security in the .NET Framework | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Security in the .NET
