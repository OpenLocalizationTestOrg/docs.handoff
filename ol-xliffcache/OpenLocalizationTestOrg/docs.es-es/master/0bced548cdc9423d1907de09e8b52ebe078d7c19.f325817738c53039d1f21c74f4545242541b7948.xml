This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the `ServerAuthentication` object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas WCF does not enforce such a constraint. If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to access the service metadata.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md)\n- [How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,290],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"service certificate validation [WCF]\"\n  - \"certificates [WCF], service certificate validation\"\nms.assetid: 9dffcab2-70a9-40f0-99fd-d3a0b296028f","nodes":[{"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","nodes":[{"pos":[0,84],"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","nodes":[{"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","pos":[0,84]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[297,381],"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","linkify":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","nodes":[{"content":"Differences Between Service Certificate Validation Done by Internet Explorer and WCF","pos":[0,84]}]},{"content":"Because of difference between the way Internet Explorer and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) validate service certificates when HTTPS is used, it is possible that Internet Explorer will not be able to access the Help page or Web Services Description Language (WSDL) of a service even though a WCF client is able to successfully send messages to the service endpoints.","pos":[382,755]},{"content":"This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServerAuthentication`</ph> object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas WCF does not enforce such a constraint.","pos":[756,961],"source":" This is because Internet Explorer checks whether the service certificate has the `ServerAuthentication` object identifiers (OID) in the enhanced usage flags, whereas WCF does not enforce such a constraint."},{"content":"If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md)</ept> to access the service metadata.","pos":[962,1226],"source":" If Internet Explorer is unable to access the service Help page or the WSDL for the service, use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to access the service metadata."},{"pos":[1235,1243],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1247,1423],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md)</ept>","source":"[Certificate Validation Differences Between HTTPS, SSL over TCP, and SOAP Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/cert-val-diff-https-ssl-over-tcp-and-soap.md)"},{"pos":[1426,1597],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Retrieve Metadata and Implement a Compliant Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-metadata-and-implement-a-compliant-service.md)"}]}
