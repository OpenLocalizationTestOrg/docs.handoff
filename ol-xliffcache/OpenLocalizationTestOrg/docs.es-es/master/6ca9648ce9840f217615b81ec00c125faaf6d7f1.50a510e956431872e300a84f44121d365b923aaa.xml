If an application needs to create a file, that application needs `Create` access for the folder. If the file already exists, the application needs only `Write` access, a lesser privilege. Where possible, it is more secure to create the file during deployment, and only grant `Read` access to a single file, rather than `Create` access for a folder.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO.StreamWriter>   \n [How to: Read Object Data from an XML File (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/how-to-read-object-data-from-an-xml-file.md)   \n [Serialization (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,458],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,72],"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]}],"pos":[6,81],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Write Object Data to an XML File (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
