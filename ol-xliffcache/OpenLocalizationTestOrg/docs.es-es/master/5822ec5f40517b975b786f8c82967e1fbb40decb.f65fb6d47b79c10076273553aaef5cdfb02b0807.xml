You use the same classes, and in some cases the same methods. However, the structure and goals of the two approaches are very different. For example, in different situations, one or the other approach will often have better performance, and use more or less memory. In addition, one or the other approach will be easier to write and yield more maintainable code.  \n  \n To see the two approaches contrasted, see [In-Memory XML Tree Modification vs. Functional Construction (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/in-memory-xml-tree-modification-vs-functional-construction.md).  \n  \n For a tutorial on writing functional transformations, see [Pure Functional Transformations of XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/pure-functional-transformations-of-xml.md).  \n  \n##
