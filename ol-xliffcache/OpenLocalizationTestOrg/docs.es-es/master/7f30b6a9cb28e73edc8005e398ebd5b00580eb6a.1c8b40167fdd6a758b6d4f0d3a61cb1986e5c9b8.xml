To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim number? As Integer = 5  \n\nIf number IsNot Nothing Then  \n  If number.GetType() Is Type.GetType(\"System.Int32\") Then   \n\n  End If  \nEnd If  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Nullable Value Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)\n- [Is Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,265],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32127\"\n  - \"bc32127\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32127\"\nms.assetid: 68b745b5-8605-4bf3-a6ec-69e67b3cff2d","nodes":[{"content":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,104],"content":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","nodes":[{"content":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","pos":[0,104]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[272,376],"content":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","linkify":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","nodes":[{"content":"'Is' operand of type 'typename' can only be compared to 'Nothing', because 'typename' is a nullable type","pos":[0,104]}]},{"pos":[377,492],"content":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Is`</ph> operator.","source":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator."},{"pos":[499,520],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32127","source":"**Error ID:** BC32127"},{"pos":[529,550],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[558,774],"content":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Is`</ph> operator, call the <ph id=\"ph3\">`GetType`</ph> method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.","source":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `Is` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[944,952],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[956,1069],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Nullable Value Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Nullable Value Types](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)"},{"pos":[1072,1149],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Is Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[Is Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/is-operator.md)"}]}
