The Event-based Asynchronous Pattern prescribes the recommended way for classes to present asynchronous behavior.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern Overview](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/event-based-asynchronous-pattern-overview.md)  \n Describes how the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern makes available the advantages of multithreaded applications while hiding many of the complex issues inherent in multithreaded design.  \n  \n [Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/implementing-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  \n Describes the standardized way to package a class that has asynchronous features.  \n  \n [Best Practices for Implementing the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/best-practices-for-implementing-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  \n Describes the requirements for exposing asynchronous features according to the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.  \n  \n [Deciding When to Implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/deciding-when-to-implement-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  \n Describes how to determine when you should choose to implement the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern instead of the <xref:System.IAsyncResult> pattern.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Implementing a Component That Supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/component-that-supports-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  \n Illustrates how to create a component that implements the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern. It is implemented using helper classes from the <xref:System.ComponentModel?displayProperty=fullName> namespace, which ensures that the component works correctly under any application model.  \n  \n [How to: Use Components That Support the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern](../../../docs/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/how-to-use-components-that-support-the-event-based-asynchronous-pattern.md)  \n Describes how to use a component that supports the Event-based Asynchronous Pattern.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ComponentModel.AsyncOperation>  \n Describes the <xref:System.ComponentModel.AsyncOperation> class and has links to all its
