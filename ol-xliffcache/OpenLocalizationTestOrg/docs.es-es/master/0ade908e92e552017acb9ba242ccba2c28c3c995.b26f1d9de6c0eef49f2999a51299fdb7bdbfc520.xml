The image is placed in the first column and row of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> (the upper-left corner).  \n  \n Next, the example adds a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element to the first column, which spans the remaining columns of the first row. It adds another <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> element to the second row in the first column, to represent the **Open** text box. A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> follows, which represents the data entry area.  \n  \n Finally, the example adds three <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements to the final row, which represent the **OK**, **Cancel**, and **Browse** events.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[GridRunDialog#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridRunDialog/CSharp/window1.xaml.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[GridRunDialog#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridRunDialog/VisualBasic/grid_vb.vb#1)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>\n- <xref:System.Windows.GridUnitType>\n- [Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](grid-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,280],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Build a Standard UI Dialog Box by Using Grid\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
