In most scenarios, however, you will eventually reach a point where your application should not continue until the database operation is complete. For such cases, it is useful to poll the asynchronous operation to determine whether the operation has completed or not.  \n  \n You can use the <xref:System.IAsyncResult.IsCompleted%2A> property to find out whether or not the operation has completed.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following console application updates data within the **AdventureWorks** sample database, doing its work asynchronously. In order to emulate a long-running process, this example inserts a WAITFOR statement in the command text. Normally, you would not try to make your commands run slower, but doing so in this case makes it easier to demonstrate asynchronous behavior.  \n  \n```vb  \nImports System  \nImports System.Data.SqlClient  \n  \nModule Module1  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        ' The WAITFOR statement simply adds enough time to prove the   \n        ' asynchronous nature of the command.  \n        Dim commandText As String = _  \n         \"UPDATE Production.Product \" & _  \n         \"SET ReorderPoint = ReorderPoint + 1 \" & _  \n         \"WHERE ReorderPoint Is Not Null;\" & _  \n         \"WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:3';\" & _  \n         \"UPDATE Production.Product \" & _  \n         \"SET ReorderPoint = ReorderPoint - 1 \" & _  \n         \"WHERE ReorderPoint Is Not Null\"  \n  \n        RunCommandAsynchronously(commandText, GetConnectionString())  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press Enter to continue.\")  \n        Console.ReadLine()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Private Sub RunCommandAsynchronously( _  \n     ByVal commandText As String, ByVal connectionString As String)  \n  \n        ' Given command text and connection string, asynchronously   \n        ' execute the specified command against the connection.
