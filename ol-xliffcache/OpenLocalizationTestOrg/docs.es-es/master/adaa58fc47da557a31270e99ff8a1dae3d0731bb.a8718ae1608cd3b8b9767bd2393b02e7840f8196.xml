In longer code files, it is convenient to be able to collapse or hide one or more regions so that you can focus on the part of the file that you are currently working on. The following example shows how to define a region:  \n  \n```csharp\n#region MyClass definition  \npublic class MyClass   \n{  \n    static void Main()   \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n#endregion  \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n A `#region` block must be terminated with a [#endregion](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endregion.md) directive.  \n  \n A `#region` block cannot overlap with a [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) block. However, a `#region` block can be nested in a `#if` block, and a `#if` block can be nested in a `#region` block.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [C# Preprocessor Directives](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,204],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"#region - C# Reference\"\nms.custom: seodec18\n\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"#region\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"#region directive [C#]\"\nms.assetid: 672c87d1-9771-4f64-ab3f-0ad3d4ffb2b4","nodes":[{"content":"#region - C# Reference","nodes":[{"pos":[1,22],"content":"region - C# Reference","linkify":"region - C# Reference","nodes":[{"content":"region - C# Reference","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[211,233],"content":"#region (C# Reference)","linkify":"#region (C# Reference)","nodes":[{"content":"#region (C# Reference)","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`#region`</ph> lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>outlining<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/outlining)</ept> feature of the Visual Studio Code Editor.","pos":[234,406],"source":"`#region` lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the [outlining](/visualstudio/ide/outlining) feature of the Visual Studio Code Editor."},{"content":"In longer code files, it is convenient to be able to collapse or hide one or more regions so that you can focus on the part of the file that you are currently working on.","pos":[407,577]},{"content":"The following example shows how to define a region:","pos":[578,629]},{"pos":[773,780],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[784,937],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`#region`</ph> block must be terminated with a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#endregion<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endregion.md)</ept> directive.","source":"A `#region` block must be terminated with a [#endregion](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endregion.md) directive."},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`#region`</ph> block cannot overlap with a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#if<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md)</ept> block.","pos":[944,1075],"source":"A `#region` block cannot overlap with a [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md) block."},{"content":"However, a <ph id=\"ph1\">`#region`</ph> block can be nested in a <ph id=\"ph2\">`#if`</ph> block, and a <ph id=\"ph3\">`#if`</ph> block can be nested in a <ph id=\"ph4\">`#region`</ph> block.","pos":[1076,1188],"source":" However, a `#region` block can be nested in a `#if` block, and a `#if` block can be nested in a `#region` block."},{"pos":[1197,1205],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1209,1268],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)"},{"pos":[1271,1337],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Programming Guide<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)"},{"pos":[1340,1437],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Preprocessor Directives<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Preprocessor Directives](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/index.md)"}]}
