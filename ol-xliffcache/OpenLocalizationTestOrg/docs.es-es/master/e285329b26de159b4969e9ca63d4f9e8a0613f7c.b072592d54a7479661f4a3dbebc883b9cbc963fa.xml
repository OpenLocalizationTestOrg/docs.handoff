You can add several types of curves (ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines) to a path, but each curve is converted to a Bézier spline before it is stored in the path. Flattening a path consists of converting each Bézier spline in the path to a sequence of straight lines. The following illustration shows a path before and after flattening.  \n  \n ![Straight Lines and Curves](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"AboutGdip02_Art32A\")  \n  \n### To Flatten a Path  \n  \n-   call the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/lines-curves-and-shapes.md)   \n [Constructing and Drawing Paths](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[604,645],"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","linkify":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line","pos":[0,41]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> object stores a sequence of lines and Bézier splines.","pos":[646,746],"source":"A <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object stores a sequence of lines and Bézier splines."},{"content":"You can add several types of curves (ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines) to a path, but each curve is converted to a Bézier spline before it is stored in the path.","pos":[747,908]},{"content":"Flattening a path consists of converting each Bézier spline in the path to a sequence of straight lines.","pos":[909,1013]},{"content":"The following illustration shows a path before and after flattening.","pos":[1014,1082]},{"pos":[1089,1213],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">![</bpt>Straight Lines and Curves<ept id=\"p1\">]</ept><bpt id=\"p2\">(../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"</bpt>AboutGdip02_Art32A<ept id=\"p2\">\")</ept>","source":"![Straight Lines and Curves](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art32a.gif \"AboutGdip02_Art32A\")"},{"pos":[1223,1240],"content":"To Flatten a Path","linkify":"To Flatten a Path","nodes":[{"content":"To Flatten a Path","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"call the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A&gt;</ph> method of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[1250,1379],"source":"call the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> object."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A&gt;</ph> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path.","pos":[1380,1561],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.Flatten%2A> method receives a flatness argument that specifies the maximum distance between the flattened path and the original path."},{"pos":[1570,1578],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Lines, Curves, and Shapes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/lines-curves-and-shapes.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1655,1757],"source":" [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/lines-curves-and-shapes.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Constructing and Drawing Paths<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)</ept>","pos":[1760,1873],"source":" [Constructing and Drawing Paths](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/constructing-and-drawing-paths.md)"}]}
