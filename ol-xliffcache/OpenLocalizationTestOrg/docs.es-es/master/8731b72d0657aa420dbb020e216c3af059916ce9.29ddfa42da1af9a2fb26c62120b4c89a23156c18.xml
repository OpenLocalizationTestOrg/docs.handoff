In addition, with its support for the WS-AtomicTransaction (WS-AT) protocol, applications can flow transactions to Web services built using either WCF or third-party technology.  \n  \n In a WCF service or application, WCF transaction features provide attributes and configuration for declaratively specifying how and when the infrastructure should create, flow, and synchronize transactions.  \n  \n## System.Transactions Transactions  \n The <xref:System.Transactions> namespace provides both an explicit programming model based on the <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction> class, as well as an implicit programming model using the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope> class, in which the infrastructure automatically manages transactions.  \n  \n For more information about how to create a transactional application using these two models, see [Writing a Transactional Application](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94947).  \n  \n In a WCF service or application, <xref:System.Transactions> provides the programming model for creating transactions within a client application and for explicitly interacting with a transaction, when required, within a service.  \n  \n## MSDTC Transactions  \n The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a transaction manager that provides support for distributed transactions.  \n  \n For more information, see the [DTC Programmer's Reference](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=94948).  \n  \n In a WCF service or application, MSDTC provides the infrastructure for the coordination of transactions created within a client or service.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,102],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Transaction Models\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
