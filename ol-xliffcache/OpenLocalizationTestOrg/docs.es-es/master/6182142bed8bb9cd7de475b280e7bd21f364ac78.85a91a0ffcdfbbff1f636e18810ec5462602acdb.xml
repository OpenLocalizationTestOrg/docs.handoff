To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections. Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)  \n Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  \n  \n [OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)  \n Describes connection pooling for the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md)   \n [ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,47],"content":"Connection Pooling | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Connection Pooling | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[356,374],"content":"Connection Pooling","linkify":"Connection Pooling","nodes":[{"content":"Connection Pooling","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"Connecting to a data source can be time consuming.","pos":[375,425]},{"content":"To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>connection pooling<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections.","pos":[426,610],"source":" To minimize the cost of opening connections, ADO.NET uses an optimization technique called *connection pooling*, which minimizes the cost of repeatedly opening and closing connections."},{"content":"Connection pooling is handled differently for the .NET Framework data providers.","pos":[611,691]},{"pos":[700,715],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)</ept>","pos":[719,833],"source":"[SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql-server-connection-pooling.md)"},{"content":"Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[837,990],"source":" Provides an overview of connection pooling and describes how connection pooling works in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)</ept>","pos":[997,1127],"source":"[OLE DB, ODBC, and Oracle Connection Pooling](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ole-db-odbc-and-oracle-connection-pooling.md)"},{"content":"Describes connection pooling for the .NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB, the .NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC, and the .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle.","pos":[1131,1300]},{"pos":[1309,1317],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1321,1437],"source":"[Retrieving and Modifying Data in ADO.NET](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)</ept>","pos":[1440,1544],"source":" [ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)"}]}
