It restricts the objects produced by the query expression by limiting the elements of the source collections to those that pass the condition.  \n  \n```  \nselect c from cs as c where e  \n```  \n  \n The expression `e` must have the type Boolean.  \n  \n The WHERE clause is applied directly after the FROM clause and before any grouping, ordering, or projection takes place. All element names defined in the FROM clause are visible to the expression of the WHERE clause.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)   \n [Query Expressions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/query-expressions-entity-sql.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,47],"content":"WHERE (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"WHERE (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[411,429],"content":"WHERE (Entity SQL)","linkify":"WHERE (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"WHERE (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[430,578],"content":"The WHERE clause is applied directly after the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>FROM<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/from-entity-sql.md)</ept> clause.","source":"The WHERE clause is applied directly after the [FROM](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/from-entity-sql.md) clause."},{"pos":[587,593],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[643,652],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"A Boolean type.","pos":[672,687]},{"pos":[696,703],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The WHERE clause has the same semantics as described for <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[707,820],"source":"The WHERE clause has the same semantics as described for [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]."},{"content":"It restricts the objects produced by the query expression by limiting the elements of the source collections to those that pass the condition.","pos":[821,963]},{"pos":[1017,1063],"content":"The expression <ph id=\"ph1\">`e`</ph> must have the type Boolean.","source":"The expression `e` must have the type Boolean."},{"content":"The WHERE clause is applied directly after the FROM clause and before any grouping, ordering, or projection takes place.","pos":[1070,1190]},{"content":"All element names defined in the FROM clause are visible to the expression of the WHERE clause.","pos":[1191,1286]},{"pos":[1295,1303],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1307,1422],"source":"[Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Query Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/query-expressions-entity-sql.md)</ept>","pos":[1425,1545],"source":" [Query Expressions](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/query-expressions-entity-sql.md)"}]}
