The tabs can contain pictures and other controls. You can use the tab control to produce the kind of multiple-page dialog box that appears many places in the Windows operating system, such as the Control Panel Display Properties. Additionally, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> can be used to create property pages, which are used to set a group of related properties.  \n  \n## Working with TabControl  \n The most important property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl.TabPages%2A>, which contains the individual tabs. Each individual tab is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabPage> object. When a tab is clicked, it raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event for that <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabPage> object.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>\n- [TabControl Control](tabcontrol-control-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Change the Appearance of the Windows Forms TabControl](how-to-change-the-appearance-of-the-windows-forms-tabcontrol.md)\n- [How to: Add a Control to a Tab Page](how-to-add-a-control-to-a-tab-page.md)\n- [How to: Add and Remove Tabs with the Windows Forms TabControl](how-to-add-and-remove-tabs-with-the-windows-forms-tabcontrol.md)\n- [How to: Disable Tab Pages](how-to-disable-tab-pages.md)\n- [Dialog Boxes in Windows Forms](../dialog-boxes-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,403],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"TabControl Control Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  -
