Visual Basic\nThis section covers conceptual documentation for the Visual Basic language.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Programming in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/index.md)  \n Covers a variety of programming subjects.  \n  \n [Development with My](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/index.md)  \n Discusses a new feature called `My`, which provides access to information and default object instances that are related to an application and its run-time environment.  \n  \n [Accessing Data in Visual Basic Applications](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/accessing-data.md)  \n Contains Help on accessing data in Visual Basic.   \n  \n [Creating and Using Components in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/creating-and-using-components.md)  \n Defines the term *component* and discusses how and when to create components.  \n  \n [Printing and Reporting](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/printing-and-reporting.md)  \n Provides overviews and links to the relevant documentation related to printing and reporting.  \n  \n [Windows Forms Application Basics](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/windows-forms-application-basics.md)  \n Provides information about creating Windows Forms applications by using Visual Studio.  \n  \n [Customizing Projects and Extending My](../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/customizing-projects-and-extending-my.md)  \n Describes how you can customize project templates to provide additional `My` objects.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Visual Basic Programming Guide](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/index.md)  \n Walks through the essential elements of programming with Visual Basic.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Language Reference](../../visual-basic/language-reference/index.md)  \n Contains reference documentation for the Visual Basic language.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"Developing Applications with Visual Basic | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Developing
