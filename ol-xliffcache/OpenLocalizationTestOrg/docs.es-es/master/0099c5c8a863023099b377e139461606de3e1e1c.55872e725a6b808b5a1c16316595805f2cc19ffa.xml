The following template specifies the general rule for naming namespaces:  \n  \n `<Company>.(<Product>|<Technology>)[.<Feature>][.<Subnamespace>]`  \n  \n The following are examples:  \n  \n `Fabrikam.Math`  \n `Litware.Security`  \n  \n **✓ DO** prefix namespace names with a company name to prevent namespaces from different companies from having the same name.  \n  \n **✓ DO** use a stable, version-independent product name at the second level of a namespace name.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** use organizational hierarchies as the basis for names in namespace hierarchies, because group names within corporations tend to be short-lived. Organize the hierarchy of namespaces around groups of related technologies.  \n  \n **✓ DO** use PascalCasing, and separate namespace components with periods (e.g., `Microsoft.Office.PowerPoint`). If your brand employs nontraditional casing, you should follow the casing defined by your brand, even if it deviates from normal namespace casing.  \n  \n **✓ CONSIDER** using plural namespace names where appropriate.  \n  \n For example, use `System.Collections` instead of `System.Collection`. Brand names and acronyms are exceptions to this rule, however. For example, use `System.IO` instead of `System.IOs`.  \n  \n **X DO NOT** use the same name for a namespace and a type in that namespace.  \n  \n For example, do not use `Debug` as a namespace name and then also provide a class named `Debug` in the same namespace. Several compilers require such types to be fully qualified.  \n  \n### Namespaces and Type Name Conflicts  \n **X DO NOT** introduce generic type names such as `Element`, `Node`, `Log`, and `Message`.  \n  \n There is a very high probability that doing so will lead to type name conflicts in common scenarios. You should qualify the generic type names (`FormElement`, `XmlNode`, `EventLog`, `SoapMessage`).  \n  \n There are specific guidelines for avoiding type name conflicts for different categories of namespaces.  \n  \n-   **Application model namespaces**  \n  \n     Namespaces belonging to a single application model are very often used together, but they are almost never used with namespaces of other application models. For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace is very rarely used together with the <xref:System.Web.UI?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace. The following is a list of well-known application model namespace groups:  \n  \n     `System.Windows*`   \n     `System.Web.UI*`  \n  \n     **X DO NOT** give the same name to types in namespaces within a single application model.  \n  \n     For example, do not add a type named `Page` to the <xref:System.Web.UI.Adapters?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace, because the <xref:System.Web.UI?displayProperty=nameWithType> namespace already contains a type named `Page`.  \n  \n-   **Infrastructure namespaces**  \n  \n     This group contains namespaces that are rarely imported during development of common applications. For example, `.Design` namespaces are mainly used when developing programming tools. Avoiding conflicts with types in these namespaces is not critical.  \n  \n-   **Core namespaces**  \n  \n     Core namespaces include all `System` namespaces, excluding namespaces of the application models and the Infrastructure namespaces. Core namespaces include, among others, `System`, `System.IO`, `System.Xml`, and `System.Net`.  \n  \n     **X DO NOT** give types names that would conflict with any type in the Core namespaces.  \n  \n     For example, never use `Stream` as a type name. It would conflict with <xref:System.IO.Stream?displayProperty=nameWithType>, a very commonly used type.  \n  \n-   **Technology namespace groups**  \n  \n     This category includes all namespaces with the same first two namespace nodes `(<Company>.<Technology>*`), such as `Microsoft.Build.Utilities` and `Microsoft.Build.Tasks`. It is important that types belonging to a single technology do not conflict with each other.  \n  \n     **X DO NOT** assign type names that would conflict with other types within a single technology.  \n  \n     **X DO NOT** introduce type name conflicts between types in technology namespaces and an application model namespace (unless the technology is not intended to be used with the application model).  \n  \n *Portions © 2005, 2009 Microsoft Corporation.
