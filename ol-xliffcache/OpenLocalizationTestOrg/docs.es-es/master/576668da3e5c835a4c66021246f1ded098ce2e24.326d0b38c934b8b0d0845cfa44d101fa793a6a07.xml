To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.\n\nTo resolve this error, put all member variables in a single partial class definition.\n\nA common way to get this error is by having a partial `struct` defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another.\n\nThe following code generates CS0282.\n\n## Example\n\nThis code contains one description of a `struct`. Compile these two modules together in a single step by means of the command:\n\n`csc /target:library cs0282_1.cs cs0282_2.cs`\n\n```csharp\npartial struct A\n{\n    int i;\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThis code contains a conflicting description of the same `struct`.\n\n```csharp\npartial struct A\n{\n    int j;\n}\n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,175],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords:\n  - \"CS0282\"\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"CS0282\"\nms.assetid: fd4cda5d-81c7-40e3-8424-c938b3447356","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[183,216],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 3) CS0282","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"There is no defined ordering between fields in multiple declarations of partial class or struct 'type'.","pos":[218,321]},{"content":"To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.","pos":[322,398]},{"content":"To resolve this error, put all member variables in a single partial class definition.","pos":[400,485]},{"pos":[487,655],"content":"A common way to get this error is by having a partial <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph> defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another.","source":"A common way to get this error is by having a partial `struct` defined in more than one place, with some of the member variables in one definition, and some in another."},{"content":"The following code generates CS0282.","pos":[657,693]},{"pos":[698,705],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This code contains one description of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph>.","pos":[707,756],"source":"This code contains one description of a `struct`."},{"content":"Compile these two modules together in a single step by means of the command:","pos":[757,833]},{"pos":[932,939],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[941,1007],"content":"This code contains a conflicting description of the same <ph id=\"ph1\">`struct`</ph>.","source":"This code contains a conflicting description of the same `struct`."}]}
