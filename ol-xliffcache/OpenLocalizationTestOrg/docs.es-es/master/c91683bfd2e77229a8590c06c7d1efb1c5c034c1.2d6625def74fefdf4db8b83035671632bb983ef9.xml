While the <xref:System.Transactions.TransactionScope?displayProperty=fullName> must be explicitly completed the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope?displayProperty=fullName> activity implicitly calls complete on the transaction upon successful completion. Any activities that are contained in the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity participate in the transaction. WF can to flow transactions into a workflow through the use of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope> activity. Like the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity, any activity contained in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope.Body%2A> participates in the transaction. WF ensures that activities dependent on <xref:System.Transactions.Transaction.Current%2A?displayProperty=fullName> works with both <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.TransactedReceiveScope>. If the system-provided activities do not address all requirements, custom activities can be built using the <xref:System.Activities.RuntimeTransactionHandle> to enable advanced flow and transaction control scenarios.  \n  \n In the following example, taken from the [Basic TransactionScope](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/basic-transactionscope.md) sample, a workflow is constructed consisting of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity that contains child activities including a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope.Body%2A> activities of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> execute under the transaction initialized by the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.TransactionScope> activity.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic Activity ScenarioOne()  \n{  \n    return new Sequence  \n    {  \n        Activities =  \n        {  \n            new WriteLine { Text = \"    Begin workflow\" },  \n  \n            new TransactionScope  \n            {  \n                Body = new Sequence  \n                {  \n                    Activities =   \n                    {  \n                        new WriteLine { Text = \"    Begin TransactionScope\" },  \n  \n                        new PrintTransactionId(),  \n  \n                        new TransactionScopeTest(),  \n  \n                        new WriteLine { Text = \"    End TransactionScope\" },  \n                    },  \n                },  \n            },  \n  \n            new WriteLine { Text = \"    End workflow\" },  \n        }  \n    };  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] the basic [Transactions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/transactions.md) samples, and the scenario based [Transactions](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/transactions.md) samples.
