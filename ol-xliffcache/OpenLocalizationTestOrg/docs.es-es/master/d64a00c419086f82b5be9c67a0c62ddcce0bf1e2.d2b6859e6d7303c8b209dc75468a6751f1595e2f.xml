If the profiler returns an error from this callback, the profiling services will discontinue invoking this callback until the next garbage collection.  \n  \n The `ObjectReferences` callback can be used in conjunction with the [ICorProfilerCallback::RootReferences](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback-rootreferences-method.md) callback to create a complete object reference graph for the runtime. The common language runtime (CLR) ensures that each object reference is reported only once by the `ObjectReferences` method.  \n  \n The object IDs returned by `ObjectReferences` are not valid during the callback itself, because the garbage collection might be in the middle of moving objects. Therefore, profilers must not attempt to inspect objects during an `ObjectReferences` call. When [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionfinished-method.md) is called, the garbage collection is complete and inspection can be safely done.  \n  \n A null `ClassId` indicates that `objectId` has a type that is unloading.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:**
