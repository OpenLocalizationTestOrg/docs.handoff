Controls runtime access to all type members, including constructors, methods, fields, properties, and events, to enable dynamic programming.|  \n|`Serialize`|Serialization|Optional attribute. Controls runtime access to constructors, fields, and properties, to enable type instances to be serialized and deserialized by libraries such as the Newtonsoft JSON serializer.|  \n|`DataContractSerializer`|Serialization|Optional attribute.

Possible values are `All`, `Auto`, `Excluded`, `Public`, `PublicAndInternal`, `Required Public`, `Required PublicAndInternal`, and `Required All`.

It addresses the following scenario:  \n  \n-   If a routine needs to reflect on one type, it necessarily needs to reflect on a second type.  \n  \n-   The metadata for the implied instantiation of the second type is otherwise unavailable, because static analysis doesn't indicate that it's necessary.  \n  \n Most commonly, the two types are generic instantiations with shared type arguments.  \n  \n The `<ImpliesType>` element was defined with the assumption that a need for reflection on the type specified by its parent element implies a need for reflection on the type specified by the `<ImpliesType>` element. For example, the following reflection directives apply to two types, `Explicit<T>` and `Implicit<T>`.  \n  \n```xml  \n<Type Name=\"Explicit{ET}\">  \n    <ImpliesType Name=\"Implicit{ET}\" Dynamic=\"Required Public\" />  \n</Type>  \n```  \n  \n This directive has no effect unless an instantiation of `Explicit` has a defined `Dynamic` policy setting. For example, if that's the case for `Explicit<Int32>`, `Implicit<Int32>` is instantiated with its public members rooted, and their metadata is made accessible for dynamic programming.  \n  \n The following is a real-world example that applies to at least one serializer. The directives capture the requirement that reflecting on something typed as `IList<`*something*`>` also involves reflecting on the corresponding `List<`*something*`>` type without requiring any per-application annotation.  \n  \n```xml  \n<Type Name=\"System.Collections.Generic.IList{T}\">  \n   <ImpliesType Name=\"System.Collections.Generic.List{T}\" Serialize=\"Public\" />  \n</Type>  \n```  \n  \n The `<ImpliesType>` element can also appear within a `<Method>` element, because in some cases instantiating a generic method implies reflecting on a type instantiation. For example, imagine a generic method `IEnumerable<T> MakeEnumerable<T>(string spelling, T defaultValue)` that a given library will access dynamically along with the associated <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> and <xref:System.Array> types. This can be expressed as:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Type Name=\"MyType\">  \n    <Method Name=\"MakeEnumerable{T}\" Signature=\"(System.String, T)\" Dynamic=\"Included\">  \n        <ImpliesType Name=\"T[]\" Dynamic=\"Public\" />  \n        <ImpliesType Name=\"System.Collections.Generic.List{T}\" Dynamic=\"Public\">  \n    </Method>  \n</Type>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Runtime Directives (rd.xml)
