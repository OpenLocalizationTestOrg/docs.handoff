A number of tools are available for multithreading your Windows Forms controls, including the <xref:System.Threading> namespace, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method, and the `BackgroundWorker` component.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `BackgroundWorker` component replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Threading> namespace and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> method; however, these are retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.
