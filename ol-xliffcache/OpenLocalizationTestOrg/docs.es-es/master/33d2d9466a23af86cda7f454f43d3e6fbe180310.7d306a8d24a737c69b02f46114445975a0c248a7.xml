For example, asynchronous service operations can be calling synchronously, and synchronous service operations can be called asynchronously. For an example that shows how to call an operation asynchronously in a client application, see [How to: Call Service Operations Asynchronously](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-call-wcf-service-operations-asynchronously.md). [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] synchronous and asynchronous operations, see [Designing Service Contracts](../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-service-contracts.md) and [Synchronous and Asynchronous Operations](../../../docs/framework/wcf/synchronous-and-asynchronous-operations.md). This topic describes the basic structure of an asynchronous service operation, the code is not complete. For a complete example of both the service and client sides see [Asynchronous](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/833db946-f511-4f64-a26f-2759a11217c7).  \n  \n### Implement a service operation asynchronously  \n  \n1.  In your service contract, declare an asynchronous method pair according to the .NET asynchronous design guidelines. The `Begin` method takes a parameter, a callback object, and a state object, and returns a <xref:System.IAsyncResult?displayProperty=fullName> and a matching `End` method that takes a <xref:System.IAsyncResult?displayProperty=fullName> and returns the return value. For more information about asynchronous calls, see [Asynchronous Programming Design Patterns](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248221).  \n  \n2.  Mark the `Begin` method of the asynchronous method pair with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute?displayProperty=fullName> attribute and set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute.AsyncPattern%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to `true`. For example, the following code performs steps 1 and 2.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_SyncAsyncClient#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_syncasyncclient/cs/services.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[C_SyncAsyncClient#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_syncasyncclient/vb/services.vb#6)]  \n  \n3.  Implement the `Begin/End` method pair in your service class according to the asynchronous design guidelines. For example, the following code example shows an implementation in which a string is written to the console in both the `Begin` and `End` portions of the asynchronous service operation, and the return value of the `End` operation is returned to the client. For the complete code example, see the Example section.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_SyncAsyncClient#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_syncasyncclient/cs/services.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[C_SyncAsyncClient#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_syncasyncclient/vb/services.vb#3)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code examples show:  \n  \n1.  A service contract interface with:  \n  \n    1.  A synchronous `SampleMethod` operation.  \n  \n    2.  An asynchronous `BeginSampleMethod` operation.  \n  \n    3.  An asynchronous `BeginServiceAsyncMethod`/`EndServiceAsyncMethod` operation pair.  \n  \n2.  A service implementation using a <xref:System.IAsyncResult?displayProperty=fullName> object.  \n  \n
