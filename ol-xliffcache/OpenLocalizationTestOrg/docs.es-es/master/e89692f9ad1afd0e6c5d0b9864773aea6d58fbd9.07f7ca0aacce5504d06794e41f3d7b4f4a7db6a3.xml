Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. The `Panel` control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control; however, only the `Panel` control can have scroll bars, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Panel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/group-controls-with-wf-panel-control-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to group controls with a panel using the designer.  \n  \n [How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel-using-the-designer.md)  \n Describes how to display a background color and a background image on a panel using the designer.  \n  \n [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md)  \n Describes how to display a background color and a background image on a panel.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.  \n  \n [How to: Add to or Remove from a Collection of Controls at Run Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-to-or-remove-from-a-collection-of-controls-at-run-time.md)  \n Describes how to add controls to and remove controls from any container control on your forms.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"Panel Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[519,548],"content":"Panel Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Panel Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`Panel`</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[549,644],"source":"Windows Forms `Panel` controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[645,703]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Panel`</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control;
