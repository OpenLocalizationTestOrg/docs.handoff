The XML tree is populated with all nodes that are written to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>.  \n  \n You would typically use this method when you use [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] with another class that expects to write to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, such as <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform>.  \n  \n## Example  \n One possible use for <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A> is when invoking an XSLT transformation. This example creates an XML tree, creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> from the XML tree, creates a new document, and then creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> to write into the new document. It then invokes the XSLT transformation, passing in <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>. After the transformation successfully completes, the new XML tree is populated with the results of the transformation.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstring xslMarkup = @\"<?xml version='1.0'?>  \n<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform' version='1.0'>  \n    <xsl:template match='/Parent'>  \n        <Root>  \n            <C1>  \n            <xsl:value-of select='Child1'/>  \n            </C1>  \n            <C2>  \n            <xsl:value-of select='Child2'/>  \n            </C2>  \n        </Root>  \n    </xsl:template>  \n</xsl:stylesheet>\";  \n  \nXDocument xmlTree = new XDocument(  \n    new XElement(\"Parent\",  \n        new XElement(\"Child1\", \"Child1 data\"),  \n        new XElement(\"Child2\", \"Child2 data\")  \n    )  \n);  \n  \nXDocument newTree = new XDocument();  \nusing (XmlWriter writer = newTree.CreateWriter())  \n{  \n    // Load the style sheet.  \n    XslCompiledTransform xslt = new XslCompiledTransform();  \n    xslt.Load(XmlReader.Create(new StringReader(xslMarkup)));  \n  \n    // Execute the transformation and output the results to a writer.  \n    xslt.Transform(xmlTree.CreateReader(), writer);  \n}  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine(newTree);  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Root>  \n  <C1>Child1 data</C1>  \n  <C2>Child2 data</C2>  \n</Root>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A>\n- <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>\n- <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform>\n- [Creating XML Trees (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-xml-trees.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,147],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nms.assetid: cd5674d1-5c54-4efc-ba68-e23b2875295f","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","pos":[0,65]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[154,219],"content":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","linkify":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (C#)","pos":[0,65]}]},{"content":"One way to populate an XML tree is to use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A&gt;</ph> to create an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph>, and then write to the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph>.","pos":[220,404],"source":"One way to populate an XML tree is to use <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A> to create an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, and then write to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>."},{"content":"The XML tree is populated with all nodes that are written to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph>.","pos":[405,498],"source":" The XML tree is populated with all nodes that are written to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>."},{"pos":[505,735],"content":"You would typically use this method when you use <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)]</ph> with another class that expects to write to an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph>, such as <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform&gt;</ph>.","source":"You would typically use this method when you use [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] with another class that expects to write to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, such as <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform>."},{"pos":[744,751],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"One possible use for <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A&gt;</ph> is when invoking an XSLT transformation.","pos":[755,866],"source":"One possible use for <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A> is when invoking an XSLT transformation."},{"content":"This example creates an XML tree, creates an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlReader&gt;</ph> from the XML tree, creates a new document, and then creates an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph> to write into the new document.","pos":[867,1062],"source":" This example creates an XML tree, creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> from the XML tree, creates a new document, and then creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> to write into the new document."},{"content":"It then invokes the XSLT transformation, passing in <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlReader&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1063,1175],"source":" It then invokes the XSLT transformation, passing in <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>."},{"content":"After the transformation successfully completes, the new XML tree is populated with the results of the transformation.","pos":[1176,1294]},{"content":"This example produces the following output:","pos":[2335,2378]},{"pos":[2474,2482],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2613,2712],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Creating XML Trees (C#)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-xml-trees.md)</ept>","source":"[Creating XML Trees (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/creating-xml-trees.md)"}]}
