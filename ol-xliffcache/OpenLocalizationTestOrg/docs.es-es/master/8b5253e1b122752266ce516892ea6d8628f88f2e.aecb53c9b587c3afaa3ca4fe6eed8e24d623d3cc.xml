You can use the columns to display several types of information about each list item. For example, a list of files could display the file name, file type, size, and date the file was last modified. For information on populating the columns once they are created, see [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md).  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To add columns in the designer  \n  \n1.  In the **Properties** window, set the control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.View%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.View>.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView.Columns%2A> property.  \n  \n     The **ColumnHeader Collection Editor** appears.  \n  \n3.  Use the **Add** button to add new columns. You can then select the column header and set its text (the caption of the column), text alignment, and width.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ListView Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/listview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Add and Remove Items with the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-and-remove-items-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)   \n [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)   \n [How to: Display Icons for the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-icons-for-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)   \n [How to: Add Custom Information to a TreeView or ListView Control (Windows Forms)](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-custom-information-to-a-treeview-or-listview-control-wf.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,105],"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,93]}]},{"pos":[585,661],"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add Columns to the Windows Forms ListView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control can display multiple columns for each list item when in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Details<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> view.","pos":[662,802],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control can display multiple columns for each list item when in the **Details** view."},{"content":"You can use the columns to display several types of information about each list item.","pos":[803,888]},{"content":"For example, a list of files could display the file name, file type, size, and date the file was last modified.","pos":[889,1000]},{"content":"For information on populating the columns once they are created, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)</ept>.","pos":[1001,1272],"source":" For information on populating the columns once they are created, see [How to: Display Subitems in Columns with the Windows Forms ListView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-subitems-in-columns-with-the-windows-forms-listview-control.md)."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1279,1416],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Application Project<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1417,1717],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1725,2101],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
