The following example shows a drop shadow effect applied to text. In this case, the shadow is a soft shadow, which means the shadow color blurs.  \n  \n ![Text shadow with Softness &#61; 0.25](./media/how-to-create-text-with-a-shadow/drop-shadow-text-effect.jpg) \n  \n You can control the width of a shadow by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.ShadowDepth%2A> property. A value of `4.0` indicates a shadow width of 4 pixels. You can control the softness, or blur, of a shadow by modifying the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.BlurRadius%2A> property. A value of `0.0` indicates no blurring. The following code example shows how to create a soft shadow.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextShadowSnippets#TextShadowSnippet1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextShadowSnippets/CS/SingleShadows.xaml#textshadowsnippet1)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  These shadow effects do not go through the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] text rendering pipeline. As a result, ClearType is disabled when using these effects.  \n  \n The following example shows a hard drop shadow effect applied to text. In this case, the shadow is not blurred.  \n  \n ![Text shadow with Softness &#61; 0](./media/how-to-create-text-with-a-shadow/text-shadow-softness.jpg) \n  \n You can create a hard shadow by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.BlurRadius%2A> property to `0.0`, which indicates that no blurring is used. You can control the direction of the shadow by modifying the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.Direction%2A> property. Set the directional value of this property to a degree between `0` and `360`. The following illustration shows the directional values of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.Direction%2A> property setting.  \n  \n ![DropShadow degree setting of shadow](./media/how-to-create-text-with-a-shadow/drop-shadow-degree-setting.png)\n  \n The following code example shows how to create a hard shadow.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextShadowSnippets#TextShadowSnippet2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextShadowSnippets/CS/SingleShadows.xaml#textshadowsnippet2)]  \n  \n## Using a Blur Effect  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.BlurBitmapEffect> can be used to create a shadow-like effect that can be placed behind a text object. A blur bitmap effect applied to text blurs the text evenly in all directions.  \n  \n The following example shows a blur effect applied to text.  \n  \n ![Text shadow using a BlurBitmapEffect](./media/how-to-create-text-with-a-shadow/text-shadow-blur-effect.jpg)  \n  \n The following code example shows how to create a blur effect.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextShadowSnippets#TextShadowSnippet6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextShadowSnippets/CS/BlurShadows.xaml#textshadowsnippet6)]  \n  \n## Using a Translate Transform  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Media.TranslateTransform> can be used to create a shadow-like effect that can be placed behind a text object.  \n  \n The following code example uses a <xref:System.Windows.Media.TranslateTransform> to offset text. In this example, a slightly offset copy of text below the primary text creates a shadow effect.  \n  \n ![Text shadow using a TranslateTransform](./media/how-to-create-text-with-a-shadow/text-transform-shadow-effect.jpg)    \n  \n The following code example shows how to create a transform for a shadow effect.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[TextShadowSnippets#TextShadowSnippet7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/TextShadowSnippets/CS/TransformShadows.xaml#textshadowsnippet7)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,240],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create Text with a Shadow\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"typography [WPF], shadow effects\"\n  - \"shadow effects in text [WPF]\"\n  - \"text [WPF], shadowed\"\nms.assetid: 6ab9c754-6001-4708-b479-5367f2fd1a35","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[247,280],"content":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","linkify":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create Text with a Shadow","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"The examples in this section show how to create a shadow effect for displayed text.","pos":[281,364]},{"pos":[373,380],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect&gt;</ph> object allows you to create a variety of drop shadow effects for <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> objects.","pos":[384,594],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect> object allows you to create a variety of drop shadow effects for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] objects."},{"content":"The following example shows a drop shadow effect applied to text.","pos":[595,660]},{"content":"In this case, the shadow is a soft shadow, which means the shadow color blurs.","pos":[661,739]},{"content":"Text shadow with Softness &amp;#61; 0.25","pos":[748,784],"source":"Text shadow with Softness &#61; 0.25"},{"content":"You can control the width of a shadow by setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.ShadowDepth%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[861,991],"source":"You can control the width of a shadow by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.ShadowDepth%2A> property."},{"content":"A value of <ph id=\"ph1\">`4.0`</ph> indicates a shadow width of 4 pixels.","pos":[992,1046],"source":" A value of `4.0` indicates a shadow width of 4 pixels."},{"content":"You can control the softness, or blur, of a shadow by modifying the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.BlurRadius%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[1047,1191],"source":" You can control the softness, or blur, of a shadow by modifying the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Effects.DropShadowEffect.BlurRadius%2A> property."},{"content":"A value of <ph id=\"ph1\">`0.0`</ph> indicates no blurring.","pos":[1192,1231],"source":" A value of `0.0` indicates no blurring."},{"content":"The following code example shows how to create a soft shadow.","pos":[1232,1293]},{"pos":[1462,1681],"content":"[!NOTE]\n These shadow effects do not go through the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] text rendering pipeline.
