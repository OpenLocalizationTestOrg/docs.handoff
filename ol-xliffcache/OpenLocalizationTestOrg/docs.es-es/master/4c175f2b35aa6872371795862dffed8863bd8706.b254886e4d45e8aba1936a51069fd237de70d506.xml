When creating secure services or clients, you can specify a certificate be used as the client or service credential by using methods such as the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.X509CertificateInitiatorClientCredential.SetCertificate%2A> method. The method requires various parameters, such as the store where the certificate is stored and a value to use when searching for the certificate. The following procedure demonstrates how to examine the stores on a computer to find an appropriate certificate. For an example of finding the certificate thumbprint, see [How to: Retrieve the Thumbprint of a Certificate](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-retrieve-the-thumbprint-of-a-certificate.md).  \n  \n### To view certificates in the MMC snap-in  \n  \n1.  Open a Command Prompt window.  \n  \n2.  Type `mmc` and press the ENTER key. Note that to view certificates in the local machine store, you must be in the Administrator role.  \n  \n3.  On the **File** menu, click **Add/Remove Snap In**.  \n  \n4.  Click **Add**.  \n  \n5.  In the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box, select **Certificates**.  \n  \n6.  Click **Add**.  \n  \n7.  In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select **Computer account** and click **Next**. Optionally, you can select **My User account** or **Service account**. If you are not an administrator of the computer, you can manage certificates only for your user account.  \n  \n8.  In the **Select Computer** dialog box, click **Finish**.  \n  \n9. In the **Add Standalone Snap-in** dialog box, click **Close**.  \n  \n10. On the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, click **OK**.  \n  \n11. In the **Console Root** window, click **Certificates (Local Computer)** to view the certificate stores for the computer.  \n  \n12. Optional. To view certificates for your account, repeat steps 3 to 6. In step 7, instead of selecting **Computer account**, click **My User account** and repeat steps 8 to 10.  \n  \n13. Optional. On the **File** menu, click **Save** or **Save As**. Save the console file for later reuse.  \n  \n## Viewing Certificates with Internet Explorer  \n You can also view, export, import, and delete certificates by using Internet Explorer.  \n  \n#### To view certificates with Internet Explorer  \n  \n1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, then click **Internet Options** to display the **Internet Options** dialog box.  \n  \n2.  Click the **Content** tab.  \n  \n3.  Under **Certificates**, click **Certificates**.  \n  \n4.  To view details of any certificate, select the certificate and click **View**.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Working with
