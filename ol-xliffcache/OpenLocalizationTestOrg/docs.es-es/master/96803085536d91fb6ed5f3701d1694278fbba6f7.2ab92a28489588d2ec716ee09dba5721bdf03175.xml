You can examine the **Status** property to determine the error that occurred and take the proper steps to resolve the error.  \n  \n The following table describes the possible values for the **Status** property.  \n  \n|Status|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|ConnectFailure|The remote service could not be contacted at the transport level.|  \n|ConnectionClosed|The connection was closed prematurely.|  \n|KeepAliveFailure|The server closed a connection made with the Keep-alive header set.|  \n|NameResolutionFailure|The name service could not resolve the host name.|  \n|ProtocolError|The response received from the server was complete but indicated an error at the protocol level.|  \n|ReceiveFailure|A complete response was not received from the remote server.|  \n|RequestCanceled|The request was canceled.|  \n|SecureChannelFailure|An error occurred in a secure channel link.|  \n|SendFailure|A complete request could not be sent to the remote server.|  \n|ServerProtocolViolation|The server response was not a valid HTTP response.|  \n|Success|No error was encountered.|  \n|Timeout|No response was received within the time-out set for the request.|  \n|TrustFailure|A server certificate could not be validated.|  \n|MessageLengthLimitExceeded|A message was received that exceeded the specified limit when sending a request or receiving a response from the server.|  \n|Pending|An internal asynchronous request is pending.|  \n|PipelineFailure|This value supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly in your code.|  \n|ProxyNameResolutionFailure|The name resolver service could not resolve the proxy host name.|  \n|UnknownError|An exception of unknown type has occurred.|  \n  \n When the **Status** property is **WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError**, a **WebResponse** that contains the response from the server is available. You can examine this response to determine the actual source of the protocol error.  \n  \n The following example shows how to catch a **WebException**.  \n  \n```csharp  \ntry   \n{  \n    // Create a request instance.  \n    WebRequest myRequest =   \n    WebRequest.Create(\"http://www.contoso.com\");  \n    // Get the response.  \n    WebResponse myResponse = myRequest.GetResponse();  \n    //Get a readable stream from the server.   \n    Stream sr = myResponse.GetResponseStream();  \n  \n    //Read from the stream and write any data to the console.  \n    bytesread = sr.Read( myBuffer, 0, length);  \n    while( bytesread > 0 )   \n    {  \n        for (int i=0; i<bytesread; i++) {  \n            Console.Write( \"{0}\", myBuffer[i]);  \n        }  \n        Console.WriteLine();  \n        bytesread = sr.Read( myBuffer, 0, length);  \n    }  \n    sr.Close();  \n    myResponse.Close();  \n}  \ncatch (WebException webExcp)   \n{  \n    // If you reach this point, an exception has been caught.  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"A WebException has been caught.\");  \n    // Write out the WebException message.  \n    Console.WriteLine(webExcp.ToString());  \n    // Get the WebException status code.  \n    WebExceptionStatus status =  webExcp.Status;  \n    // If status is WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError,   \n    //   there has been a protocol error and a WebResponse   \n    //   should exist. Display the protocol error.  \n    if (status == WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError) {  \n        Console.Write(\"The server returned protocol error \");  \n        // Get HttpWebResponse so that you can check the HTTP status code.  \n        HttpWebResponse httpResponse = (HttpWebResponse)webExcp.Response;  \n        Console.WriteLine((int)httpResponse.StatusCode + \" - \"  \n           + httpResponse.StatusCode);  \n    }  \n}  \ncatch (Exception e)   \n{  \n    // Code to catch other exceptions goes here.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nTry  \n    ' Create a request instance.  \n    Dim myRequest As WebRequest = WebRequest.Create(\"http://www.contoso.com\")  \n    ' Get the response.  \n    Dim myResponse As WebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse()  \n    'Get a readable stream from the server.   \n    Dim sr As Stream = myResponse.GetResponseStream()  \n  \n    Dim i As Integer      \n    'Read from the stream and write any data to the console.  \n    bytesread = sr.Read(myBuffer, 0, length)  \n    While bytesread > 0  \n        For i = 0 To bytesread - 1  \n            Console.Write(\"{0}\", myBuffer(i))  \n        Next i  \n        Console.WriteLine()  \n        bytesread = sr.Read(myBuffer, 0, length)  \n    End While  \n    sr.Close()  \n    myResponse.Close()  \nCatch webExcp As WebException  \n    ' If you reach this point, an exception has been caught.  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"A WebException has been caught.\")  \n    ' Write out the WebException message.  \n    Console.WriteLine(webExcp.ToString())  \n    ' Get the WebException status code.  \n    Dim status As WebExceptionStatus = webExcp.Status  \n    ' If status is WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError,   \n    '   there has been a protocol error and a WebResponse   \n    '   should exist. Display the protocol error.  \n    If status = WebExceptionStatus.ProtocolError Then  \n        Console.Write(\"The server returned protocol error \")  \n        ' Get HttpWebResponse so that you can check the HTTP status code.  \n        Dim httpResponse As HttpWebResponse = _  \n           CType(webExcp.Response, HttpWebResponse)  \n        Console.WriteLine(CInt(httpResponse.StatusCode).ToString() & _  \n           \" - \" & httpResponse.StatusCode.ToString())  \n    End If  \nCatch e As Exception  \n    ' Code to catch other exceptions goes here.  \nEnd Try  \n```  \n  \n Applications that use the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> class throw <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException> when errors occur on the Windows socket. The <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient>, <xref:System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener>, and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient> classes are built on top of the **Socket** class and throw **SocketExceptions** as well.  \n  \n When a **SocketException** is thrown, the **SocketException** class sets the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.SocketException.ErrorCode%2A> property to the last operating system socket error that occurred.
