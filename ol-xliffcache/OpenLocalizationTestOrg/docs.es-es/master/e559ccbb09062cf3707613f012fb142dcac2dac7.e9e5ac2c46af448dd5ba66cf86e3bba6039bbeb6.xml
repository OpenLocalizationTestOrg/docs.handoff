The **Service Manager** starts your service by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method to return. If the method does not return in this time, the manager shows an error that the service cannot be started.  \n  \n When you debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method as described in [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md), you must be aware of this 30-second period. If you place a breakpoint in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)   \n [Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,72],"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[735,778],"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","linkify":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting: Debugging Windows Services","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"When you debug a Windows service application, your service and the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Service Manager<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> interact.","pos":[779,883],"source":"When you debug a Windows service application, your service and the **Windows Service Manager** interact."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Service Manager<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> starts your service by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method to return.","pos":[884,1106],"source":" The **Service Manager** starts your service by calling the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method, and then waits 30 seconds for the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method to return."},{"content":"If the method does not return in this time, the manager shows an error that the service cannot be started.","pos":[1107,1213]},{"content":"When you debug the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method as described in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Debug Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)</ept>, you must be aware of this 30-second period.","pos":[1220,1490],"source":"When you debug the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method as described in [How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md), you must be aware of this 30-second period."},{"content":"If you place a breakpoint in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A&gt;</ph> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service.","pos":[1491,1664],"source":" If you place a breakpoint in the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase.OnStart%2A> method and do not step through it in 30 seconds, the manager will not start the service."},{"pos":[1673,1681],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Debug Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1685,1817],"source":"[How to: Debug Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Introduction to Windows Service Applications<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)</ept>","pos":[1820,1957],"source":" [Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)"}]}
