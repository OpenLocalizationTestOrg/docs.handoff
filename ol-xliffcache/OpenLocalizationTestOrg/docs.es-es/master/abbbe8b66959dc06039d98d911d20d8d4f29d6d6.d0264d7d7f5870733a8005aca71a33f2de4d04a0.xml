This is determined not only by how you declare the element itself, but also by the access level of the element's container. Code that cannot access a containing element cannot access any of its contained elements, even those declared as `Public`. For example, a `Public` variable in a `Private` structure can be accessed from inside the class that contains the structure, but not from outside that class.  \n  \n## Public  \n The [Public](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/public.md) keyword in the declaration statement specifies that the elements can be accessed from code anywhere in the same project, from other projects that reference the project, and from any assembly built from the project. The following code shows a sample `Public` declaration.  \n  \n```  \nPublic Class classForEverybody  \n```  \n  \n You can use `Public` only at module, interface, or namespace level. This means you can declare a public element at the level of a source file or namespace, or inside an interface, module, class, or structure, but not in a procedure.  \n  \n## Protected  \n The [Protected](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/protected.md) keyword in the declaration statement specifies that the elements can be accessed only from within the same class, or from a class derived from this class. The following code shows a sample `Protected` declaration.  \n  \n```  \nProtected Class classForMyHeirs  \n```  \n  \n You can use `Protected` only at class level, and only when you declare a member of a class. This means you can declare a protected element in a class, but not at the level of a source file or namespace, or inside an interface, module, structure, or procedure.  \n  \n## Friend  \n The [Friend](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/friend.md) keyword in the declaration statement specifies that the elements can be accessed from within the same assembly, but not from outside the assembly. The following code shows a sample `Friend` declaration.  \n  \n```  \nFriend stringForThisProject As String  \n```  \n  \n You can use `Friend` only at module, interface, or namespace level. This means you can declare a friend element at the level of a source file or namespace, or inside an interface, module, class, or structure, but not in a procedure.  \n  \n## Protected Friend  \n The `Protected` and `Friend` keywords together in the declaration statement specify that the elements can be accessed either from derived classes or from within the same assembly, or both. The following code shows a sample `Protected``Friend` declaration.  \n  \n```  \nProtected Friend stringForProjectAndHeirs As String  \n```  \n  \n You can use `Protected``Friend` only at class level, and only when you declare a member of a class. This means you can declare a protected friend element in a class, but not at the level of a source file or namespace, or inside an interface, module, structure, or procedure.  \n  \n## Private  \n The [Private](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md) keyword in the declaration statement specifies that the elements can be accessed only from within the same module, class, or structure. The following code shows a sample `Private` declaration.  \n  \n```  \nPrivate numberForMeOnly As Integer  \n```  \n  \n You can use `Private` only at module level. This means you can declare a private element inside a module, class, or structure, but not at the level of a source file or namespace, inside an interface, or in a procedure.  \n  \n At the module level, the `Dim` statement without any access level keywords is equivalent to a `Private` declaration. However, you might want to use the `Private` keyword to make your code easier to read and interpret.  \n  \n## Access Modifiers  \n The keywords that specify access level are called *access modifiers*. The following table compares the access modifiers.  \n  \n|Access modifier|Access level granted|Elements you can declare with this access level|Declaration context within which you can use this modifier|  \n|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
