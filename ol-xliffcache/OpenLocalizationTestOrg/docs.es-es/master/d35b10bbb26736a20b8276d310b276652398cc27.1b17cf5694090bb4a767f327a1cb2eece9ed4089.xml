Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) button next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView.Nodes%2A> property.  \n  \n     The **TreeNode Editor** appears.  \n  \n3.  To add nodes, a root node must exist; if one does not exist, you must first add a root by clicking the **Add Root** button. You can then add child nodes by selecting the root or any other node and clicking the **Add Child** button.  \n  \n4.  To delete nodes, select the node to delete and then click the **Delete** button.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [TreeView Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Set Icons for the Windows Forms TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-icons-for-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)   \n [How to: Iterate Through All Nodes of a Windows Forms TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-iterate-through-all-nodes-of-a-windows-forms-treeview-control.md)   \n [How to: Determine Which TreeView Node Was Clicked](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-determine-which-treeview-node-was-clicked-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Add Custom Information to a TreeView or ListView Control (Windows Forms)](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-custom-information-to-a-treeview-or-listview-control-wf.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,662],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,104],"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,104]}]}],"pos":[6,113],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], TreeView control\"\n  - \"TreeView control [Windows Forms], removing nodes\"\n  - \"tree nodes in TreeView control\"\n  - \"TreeView control [Windows Forms], adding nodes\"\nms.assetid: 35bf1750-045e-4ec5-97cb-b47b0dbdaa2c\ncaps.latest.revision: 7\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[669,756],"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,87]}]},{"content":"Because the Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control displays nodes in a hierarchical manner, when adding a node you must pay attention to what its parent node is.","pos":[757,938],"source":"Because the Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control displays nodes in a hierarchical manner, when adding a node you must pay attention to what its parent node is."},{"content":"The following procedure requires a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Windows Application<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project with a form containing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[945,1082],"source":"The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control."},{"content":"For information about setting up such a project, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Windows Application Project<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[1083,1383],"source":" For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md)."},{"pos":[1391,1767],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
