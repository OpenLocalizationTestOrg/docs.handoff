interface pointer to an [IHostMalloc](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmalloc-interface.md) instance by calling the [IHostMemoryManager::CreateMalloc](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostmemorymanager-createmalloc-method.md) method. `DebugAlloc` allows the runtime to get code file information for use during debugging.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n
