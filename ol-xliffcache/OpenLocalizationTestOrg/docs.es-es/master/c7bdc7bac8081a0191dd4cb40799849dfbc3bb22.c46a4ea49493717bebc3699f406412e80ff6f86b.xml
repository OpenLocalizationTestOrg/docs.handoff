Defining endpoints in code is usually not practical because the bindings and addresses for a deployed service are typically different from those used while the service is being developed. More generally, keeping the binding and addressing information out of the code allows them to change without having to recompile or redeploy the application.  \n  \n For a description of how to configure this service using configuration elements instead of code, see [How to: Specify a Service Binding in Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-specify-a-service-binding-in-configuration.md).  \n  \n### To specify in code to use the BasicHttpBinding for the service  \n  \n1.  Define a service contract for the type of service.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/cs/source.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n2.

In the hosting application, create the base address for the service and the binding to use with the service.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/cs/source.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[C_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/vb/source.vb#3)]  \n  \n4.

To modify one of the default property values of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class, set the property value on the binding to the new value before creating the host. For example, to change the default open and close timeout values of 1 minute to 2 minutes, use the following.  \n  \n
