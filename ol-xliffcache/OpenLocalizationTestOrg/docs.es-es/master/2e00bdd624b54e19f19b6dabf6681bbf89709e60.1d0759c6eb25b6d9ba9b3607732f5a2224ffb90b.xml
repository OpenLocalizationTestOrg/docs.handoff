For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object. Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case. `Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties. `WithEvents` is not supported for private `UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)\n- [Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,161],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Object or class does not support the set of events\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID459\"\nms.assetid: 785df3f3-2aae-4a25-af36-1f9879d4e5fd","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","nodes":[{"pos":[0,50],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","pos":[0,50]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[168,218],"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","linkify":"Object or class does not support the set of events","nodes":[{"content":"Object or class does not support the set of events","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"You tried to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events.","pos":[219,345],"source":"You tried to use a `WithEvents` variable with a component that cannot work as an event source for the specified set of events."},{"content":"For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that <ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> the first object.","pos":[346,465],"source":" For example, you wanted to sink the events of an object, then create another object that `Implements` the first object."},{"content":"Although you might think you could sink the events from the implemented object, this is not always the case.","pos":[466,574]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`Implements`</ph> only implements an interface for methods and properties.","pos":[575,644],"source":"`Implements` only implements an interface for methods and properties."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> is not supported for private <ph id=\"ph2\">`UserControls`</ph>, because the type info needed to raise the <ph id=\"ph3\">`ObjectEvent`</ph> is not available at run time.","pos":[645,788],"source":"`WithEvents` is not supported for private `UserControls`, because the type info needed to raise the `ObjectEvent` is not available at run time."},{"pos":[797,818],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"You cannot sink events for a component that does not source events.","pos":[828,895]},{"pos":[904,912],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[916,994],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WithEvents<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)</ept>","source":"[WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)"},{"pos":[997,1096],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Implements Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Implements Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/implements-statement.md)"}]}
