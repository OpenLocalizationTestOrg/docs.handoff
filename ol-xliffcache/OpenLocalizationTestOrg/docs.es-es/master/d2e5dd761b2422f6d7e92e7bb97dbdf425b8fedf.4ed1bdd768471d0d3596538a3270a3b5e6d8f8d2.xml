By changing the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> property, you can control the resizing behavior of the form. In addition, setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> affects how the caption bar is displayed as well as what buttons might appear on it. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle>.  \n  \n There is extensive support for this task in Visual Studio.  \n  \n See also [How to: Change the Borders of Windows Forms Using the Designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/yettzh3e(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n### To set the border style of Windows Forms programmatically  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.FormBorderStyle%2A> property to the style you want. The following code example sets the border style of form `DlgBx1` to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog>.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    DlgBx1.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    DlgBx1.FormBorderStyle = System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog;  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    DlgBx1->FormBorderStyle =  \n       System::Windows::Forms::FormBorderStyle::FixedDialog;  \n    ```  \n  \n     Also see [How to: Create Dialog Boxes at Design Time](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/55cz5x2c(v=vs.100)).  \n  \n     Additionally, if you have chosen a border style for the form that provides optional **Minimize** and **Maximize** buttons, you can specify whether you want either or both of these buttons to be functional. These buttons are useful when you want to closely control the user experience. The **Minimize** and **Maximize** buttons are enabled by default, and their functionality is manipulated through the **Properties** window.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog>\n- [Getting Started with Windows Forms](getting-started-with-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,235],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Change the Borders of Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
