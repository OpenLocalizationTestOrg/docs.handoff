To demonstrate building and using a DLL, consider the following scenario:  \n  \n-   `MathLibrary.DLL`: The library file that contains the methods to be called at run time. In this example, the DLL contains two methods, `Add` and `Multiply`.  \n  \n-   `Add`: The source file that contains the method `Add`. It returns the sum of its parameters. The class `AddClass` that contains the method `Add` is a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  \n  \n-   `Mult`: The source code that contains the method `Multiply`. It returns the product of its parameters. The class `MultiplyClass` that contains the method `Multiply` is also a member of the namespace `UtilityMethods`.  \n  \n-   `TestCode`: The file that contains the `Main` method. It uses the methods in the DLL file to calculate the sum and the product of the run-time arguments.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```vb  \n' File: Add.vb   \nNamespace UtilityMethods  \n    Public Class AddClass  \n        Public Shared Function Add(ByVal i As Long, ByVal j As Long) As Long  \n            Return i + j  \n        End Function  \n    End Class  \nEnd Namespace  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \n' File: Mult.vb  \nNamespace UtilityMethods  \n    Public Class MultiplyClass  \n        Public Shared Function Multiply(ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long) As Long  \n            Return x * y  \n        End Function  \n    End Class  \nEnd Namespace  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \n' File: TestCode.vb  \n  \nImports UtilityMethods  \n  \nModule Test  \n  \n    Sub Main(ByVal args As String())  \n  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:\")  \n  \n        If args.Length <> 2 Then  \n            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Usage: TestCode <num1> <num2>\")  \n            Return  \n        End If  \n  \n        Dim num1 As Long = Long.Parse(args(0))  \n        Dim num2 As Long = Long.Parse(args(1))  \n  \n        Dim sum As Long = AddClass.Add(num1, num2)  \n        Dim product As Long = MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  \n  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"{0} + {1} = {2}\", num1, num2, sum)  \n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"{0} * {1} = {2}\", num1, num2, product)  \n  \n    End Sub  \n  \nEnd Module  \n  \n' Output (assuming 1234 and 5678 are entered as command-line arguments):  \n' Calling methods from MathLibrary.DLL:  \n' 1234 + 5678 = 6912  \n' 1234 * 5678 = 7006652  \n```  \n  \n This file contains the algorithm that uses the DLL methods, `Add` and `Multiply`. It starts with parsing the arguments entered from the command line, `num1` and `num2`. Then it calculates the sum by using the `Add` method on the `AddClass` class, and the product by using the `Multiply` method on the `MultiplyClass` class.  \n  \n Notice that the  `Imports` statement at the beginning of the file enables you to use the unqualified class names to reference the DLL methods at compile time, as follows:  \n  \n```vb  \nMultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  \n```  \n  \n Otherwise, you have to use the fully qualified names, as follows:  \n  \n```vb  \nUtilityMethods.MultiplyClass.Multiply(num1, num2)  \n```  \n  \n## Execution  \n To run the program, enter the name of the EXE file, followed by two numbers, as follows:  \n  \n `TestCode 1234 5678`  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n To build the file `MathLibrary.DLL`, compile the two files `Add` and `Mult` by using the following command line.  \n  \n```console  \nvbc -target:library -out:MathLibrary.DLL Add.vb Mult.vb  \n```  \n  \n The [-target (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/target.md) compiler option tells the compiler to output a DLL instead of an EXE file. The [-out (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/out.md) compiler option followed by a file name is used to specify the DLL file name. Otherwise, the compiler uses the first file (`Add.vb`) as the name of the DLL.  \n  \n To build the executable file, `TestCode.exe`, use the following command line:  \n  \n```console  \nvbc -out:TestCode.exe -reference:MathLibrary.DLL TestCode.vb  \n```  \n  \n The **-out** compiler option tells the compiler to output an EXE file and specifies the name of the output file (`TestCode.exe`). This compiler option is optional. The [-reference (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/reference.md) compiler option specifies the DLL file or files that this program uses.  \n  \n For more
