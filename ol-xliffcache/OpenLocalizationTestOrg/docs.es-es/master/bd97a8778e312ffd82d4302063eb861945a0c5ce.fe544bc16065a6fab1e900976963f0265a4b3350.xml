Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31440  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Add an implementation method for the partial method. The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator. The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Definition of the partial method signature.  \nPartial Private Sub OnNameChanged()  \n    ' The body of the signature is empty.  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n' Implementation of the partial method.  \nPrivate Sub OnNameChanged()  \n    MsgBox(\"Name was changed to \" & Me.Name)  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)   \n [Partial Methods](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,139],"content":"&#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;AddressOf&amp;#39; cannot be applied to &amp;#39;methodname&amp;#39; because &amp;#39;methodname&amp;#39; is a partial method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,127],"source":"&#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[655,765],"content":"&#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method","linkify":"&#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;AddressOf&amp;#39; cannot be applied to &amp;#39;methodname&amp;#39; because &amp;#39;methodname&amp;#39; is a partial method","pos":[0,110],"source":"&#39;AddressOf&#39; cannot be applied to &#39;methodname&#39; because &#39;methodname&#39; is a partial method"}]},{"content":"A partial method has been passed to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[766,827],"source":"A partial method has been passed to the `AddressOf` operator."},{"content":"Partial methods are invalid values for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[828,892],"source":" Partial methods are invalid values for the `AddressOf` operator."},{"pos":[899,920],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31440","source":"**Error ID:** BC31440"},{"pos":[929,950],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Add an implementation method for the partial method.","pos":[960,1012]},{"content":"The implementation method is a valid value for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`AddressOf`</ph> operator.","pos":[1013,1085],"source":" The implementation method is a valid value for the `AddressOf` operator."},{"content":"The following example shows a partial method signature and its implementation.","pos":[1086,1164]},{"pos":[1462,1470],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1474,1566],"source":"[AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Partial Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)</ept>","pos":[1569,1673],"source":" [Partial Methods](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/partial-methods.md)"}]}
