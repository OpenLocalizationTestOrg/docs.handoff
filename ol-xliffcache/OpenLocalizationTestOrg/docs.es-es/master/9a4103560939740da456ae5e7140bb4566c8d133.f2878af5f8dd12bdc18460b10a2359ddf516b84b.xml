A value or an expression that evaluates to the number of elements of the sequence to return.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `Take` clause causes a query to include a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a results list. The number of elements to include is specified by the `count` parameter.  \n  \n You can use the `Take` clause with the `Skip` clause to return a range of data from any segment of a query. To do this, pass the index of the first element of the range to the `Skip` clause and the size of the range to the `Take` clause. In this case, the `Take` clause must be specified after the `Skip` clause.  \n  \n When you use the `Take` clause in a query, you may also need to ensure that the results are returned in an order that will enable the `Take` clause to include the intended results. For more information about ordering query results, see [Order By Clause](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/order-by-clause.md).  \n  \n You can use the `TakeWhile` clause to specify that only certain elements be returned, depending on a supplied condition.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example uses the `Take` clause together with the `Skip` clause to return data from a query in pages. The GetCustomers function uses the `Skip` clause to bypass the customers in the list until the supplied starting index value, and uses the `Take` clause to return a page of customers starting from that index value.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbSimpleQuerySamples#1](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/codesnippet/VisualBasic/take-clause_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Introduction to LINQ in
