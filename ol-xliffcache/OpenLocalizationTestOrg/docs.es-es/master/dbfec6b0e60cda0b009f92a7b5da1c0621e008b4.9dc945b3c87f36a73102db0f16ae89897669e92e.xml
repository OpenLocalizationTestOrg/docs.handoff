In [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages. SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,42],"content":"Calls Faulted | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,30]}]},{"pos":[340,353],"content":"Calls Faulted","linkify":"Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"content":"Calls Faulted","pos":[0,13]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted","pos":[354,381]},{"pos":[390,401],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls to this operation that returned faults.","pos":[405,460]},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[461,620],"source":" In [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages."},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[621,819]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[820,906]},{"pos":[915,923],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[927,1080],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
