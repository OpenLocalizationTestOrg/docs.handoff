Another attempt is made within the specified timeout period.  \n  \n## Description  \n This informational trace indicates that an error has occurred while attempting to reuse a pooled connection. This could happen because the pooled connection was not compatible, ready, or still active. Additional attempts to reuse other pooled connection are made within a given timeout and a new connection is created in case no usable connections are found.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,369],"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,66],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]}],"pos":[6,75],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: d535b1b5-ee58-45e8-b400-7d9570f4eb9a\ncaps.latest.revision: 6\nauthor: \"Erikre\"\nms.author: \"erikre\"\nmanager: \"erikre\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[376,425],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.FailedAcceptFromPool","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"An attempt to reuse a pooled connection failed.","pos":[426,473]},{"content":"Another attempt is made within the specified timeout period.","pos":[474,534]},{"pos":[543,554],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This informational trace indicates that an error has occurred while attempting to reuse a pooled connection.","pos":[558,666]},{"content":"This could happen because the pooled connection was not compatible, ready, or still active.","pos":[667,758]},{"content":"Additional attempts to reuse other pooled connection are made within a given timeout and a new connection is created in case no usable connections are found.","pos":[759,916]},{"pos":[925,933],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[937,1011],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1015,1169],"source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1173,1261],"source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
