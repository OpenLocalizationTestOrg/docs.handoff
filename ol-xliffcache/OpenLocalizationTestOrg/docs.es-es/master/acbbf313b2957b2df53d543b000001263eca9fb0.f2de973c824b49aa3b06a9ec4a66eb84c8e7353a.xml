In the following example, the `NullableWrapper` class defines a new method named `GetValueOrDefault`. Because this new method is not a member of <xref:System.Nullable%601>, it can be applied to `nullInstance`, an instance of a nullable type, to form an argument for `AddressOf`.  \n  \n```vb  \nModule Module1  \n  \n    Delegate Function Deleg() As Integer  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim nullInstance As New Nullable(Of Integer)(1)  \n  \n        Dim del As Deleg  \n  \n        ' GetValueOrDefault is a method of the Nullable generic  \n        ' type.
