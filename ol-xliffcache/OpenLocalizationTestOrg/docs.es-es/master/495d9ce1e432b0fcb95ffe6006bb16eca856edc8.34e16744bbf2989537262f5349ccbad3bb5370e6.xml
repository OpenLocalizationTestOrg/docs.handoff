The .svc file contains the name of the service and an optional custom service host factory. This additional file adds manageability overhead. The configuration-based activation feature removes the requirement to have a .svc file and therefore the associated overhead.  \n  \n## Configuration-Based Activation  \n Configuration-based activation takes the metadata that used to be placed in the .svc file and places it in the Web.config file. Within the<`serviceHostingEnvironment`> element there is a <`serviceActivations`> element. Within the <`serviceActivations`> element are one or more <`add`> elements, one for each hosted service. The <`add`> element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory. The following configuration example code shows how this section is used.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Each <`add`> element must specify a service or a factory attribute. Specifying both service and factory attributes is allowed.  \n  \n```  \n<serviceHostingEnvironment>  \n  <serviceActivations>  \n    <add relativeAddress=\"MyServiceAddress\" service=\"Service\" factory=\"MyServiceHostFactory\"/>  \n  </serviceActivations>  \n</serviceHostingEnvironment>  \n```  \n  \n With this in the Web.config file, you can place the service source code in the App_Code directory of the application or a complied assembly in the Bin directory of the application.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  -   When using configuration-based activation, inline code in .svc files is not supported.  \n> -   The `relativeAddress` attribute must be set to a relative address such as \"\\<sub-directory>/service.svc\" or \"~/\\<sub-directory/service.svc\".  \n> -   A configuration exception is thrown if you register a relative address that does not have a known extension associated with WCF.  \n> -   The relative address specified is relative to the root of the virtual application.  \n> -   Due to the hierarchical model of configuration, the registered relative addresses at machine and site level are inherited by virtual applications.  \n> -   Registrations in a configuration file take precedence over settings in a .svc, .xamlx, .xoml, or other file.  \n> -   Any ‘\\’ (backslashes) in a URI sent to IIS/WAS are automatically converted to a ‘/’ (forward slash). If a relative address is added that contains a ‘\\’ and you send IIS a URI that uses the relative address, the backslash is converted to a forward slash and IIS cannot match it to the relative address. IIS sends out trace information that indicates that there are no matches found.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Configuration.ServiceHostingEnvironmentSection.ServiceActivations%2A>   \n [Hosting Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)   \n [Hosting Workflow Services Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-workflow-services-overview.md)   \n [\\<serviceHostingEnvironment>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicehostingenvironment.md)   \n [Windows Server App Fabric Hosting Features](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201276)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,74],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]},{"pos":[373,418],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","linkify":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation in IIS and WAS","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"Normally when hosting a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> service under Internet Information Services (IIS) or Windows Process Activation Service (WAS), you must provide a .svc file.","pos":[419,623],"source":"Normally when hosting a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] service under Internet Information Services (IIS) or Windows Process Activation Service (WAS), you must provide a .svc file."},{"content":"The .svc file contains the name of the service and an optional custom service host factory.","pos":[624,715]},{"content":"This additional file adds manageability overhead.","pos":[716,765]},{"content":"The configuration-based activation feature removes the requirement to have a .svc file and therefore the associated overhead.","pos":[766,891]},{"pos":[900,930],"content":"Configuration-Based Activation","linkify":"Configuration-Based Activation","nodes":[{"content":"Configuration-Based Activation","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Configuration-based activation takes the metadata that used to be placed in the .svc file and places it in the Web.config file.","pos":[934,1061]},{"content":"Within the&lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`serviceHostingEnvironment`</ph>&gt; element there is a &lt;<ph id=\"ph2\">`serviceActivations`</ph>&gt; element.","pos":[1062,1152],"source":" Within the<`serviceHostingEnvironment`> element there is a <`serviceActivations`> element."},{"content":"Within the &lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`serviceActivations`</ph>&gt; element are one or more &lt;<ph id=\"ph2\">`add`</ph>&gt; elements, one for each hosted service.","pos":[1153,1257],"source":" Within the <`serviceActivations`> element are one or more <`add`> elements, one for each hosted service."},{"content":"The &lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`add`</ph>&gt; element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory.","pos":[1258,1399],"source":" The <`add`> element contains attributes that let you set the relative address for the service and the service type or a service host factory."},{"content":"The following configuration example code shows how this section is used.","pos":[1400,1472]},{"pos":[1480,1617],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Each <`add`> element must specify a service or a factory attribute.
