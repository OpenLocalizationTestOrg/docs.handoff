You can define a workflow that implements your service and describe endpoints the service exposes, all entirely in XAML. The topics in this section describe, in detail, the programming model that supports writing services declaratively.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Workflow Services Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-services-overview.md)  \n Describes the components involved in creating and hosting a workflow service.  \n  \n [Messaging Activities](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/messaging-activities.md)  \n Discusses activities that allow workflows to send and receive messages.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Workflow Service with Messaging Activities](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-workflow-service-with-messaging-activities.md)  \n Describes how to use messaging activities to create a workflow service.  \n  \n [How To: Access a Service From a Workflow Application](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-access-a-service-from-a-workflow-application.md)  \n Discusses how to call a service from a workflow application.  \n  \n [Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation.md)  \n Discusses how correlation maps messages to each other and to instances.  \n  \n [Out-of-Order Message Processing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/out-of-order-message-processing.md)  \n Describes configuring a service to accept out of order messages.  \n  \n [Contract First Workflow Service Development](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/contract-first-workflow-service-development.md)  \n Describes creating a workflow service based on an existing service contract.  \n  \n [How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/how-to-create-a-workflow-service-that-consumes-an-existing-service-contract.md)  \n Provides a step-by-step example of creating a workflow service using an existing service contract.  \n  \n [Hosting Workflow Services Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-workflow-services-overview.md)  \n Describes the different aspects of hosting a workflow service.  \n  \n [Using Contracts in Workflow](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-contracts-in-workflow.md)  \n Describes the different types of contracts and contract inference.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,101],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Workflow Services\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
