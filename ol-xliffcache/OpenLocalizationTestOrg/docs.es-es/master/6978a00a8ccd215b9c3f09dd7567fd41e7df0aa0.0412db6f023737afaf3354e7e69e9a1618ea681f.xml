Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/client-interoperability.md)  \n Demonstrates interoperability between [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and other technologies.  \n  \n [Address Headers](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/address-headers.md)  \n Demonstrates how clients can pass reference parameters to a service using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [Channel Factory](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/channel-factory.md)  \n Demonstrates how a client application can create a channel with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory> class instead of a generated client.  \n  \n [Expected Exceptions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/expected-exceptions.md)  \n Demonstrates how to catch expected exceptions when using a typed client.  \n  \n [Retrieve Metadata](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/retrieve-metadata.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a client that dynamically retrieves metadata from a service to choose an endpoint with which to communicate.  \n  \n [Avoiding Problems with the Using Statement](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/avoiding-problems-with-the-using-statement.md)  \n Demonstrates how you should not use the C# \"using\" statement to automatically clean up resources when using a typed client.  \n  \n [Typed Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/typed-client.md)  \n Demonstrates how to obtain information from a typed client generated by the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md).","nodes":[{"pos":[12,35],"content":"Client | Microsoft
