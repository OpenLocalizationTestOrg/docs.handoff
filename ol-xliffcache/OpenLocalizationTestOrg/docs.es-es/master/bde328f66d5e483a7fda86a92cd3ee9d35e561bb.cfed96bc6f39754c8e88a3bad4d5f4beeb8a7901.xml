Covariance preserves assignment compatibility and contravariance reverses it.  \n  \n The following code demonstrates the difference between assignment compatibility, covariance, and contravariance.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Assignment compatibility.   \nDim str As String = \"test\"  \n' An object of a more derived type is assigned to an object of a less derived type.   \nDim obj As Object = str  \n  \n' Covariance.   \nDim strings As IEnumerable(Of String) = New List(Of String)()  \n' An object that is instantiated with a more derived type argument   \n' is assigned to an object instantiated with a less derived type argument.   \n' Assignment compatibility is preserved.   \nDim objects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = strings  \n  \n' Contravariance.             \n' Assume that there is the following method in the class:   \n' Shared Sub SetObject(ByVal o As Object)  \n' End Sub  \nDim actObject As Action(Of Object) = AddressOf SetObject  \n  \n' An object that is instantiated with a less derived type argument   \n' is assigned to an object instantiated with a more derived type argument.   \n' Assignment compatibility is reversed.   \nDim actString As Action(Of String) = actObject  \n```  \n  \n Covariance for arrays enables implicit conversion of an array of a more derived type to an array of a less derived type. But this operation is not type safe, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim array() As Object = New String(10) {}  \n' The following statement produces a run-time exception.  \n' array(0) = 10  \n```  \n  \n Covariance and contravariance support for method groups allows for matching method signatures with delegate types. This enables you to assign to delegates not only methods that have matching signatures, but also methods that return more derived types (covariance) or that accept parameters that have less derived types (contravariance) than that specified by the delegate type. For more information, see [Variance in Delegates (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-delegates.md) and [Using Variance in Delegates (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-in-delegates.md).  \n  \n The following code example shows covariance and contravariance support for method groups.  \n  \n```vb  \nShared Function GetObject() As Object  \n    Return Nothing  \nEnd Function  \n  \nShared Sub SetObject(ByVal obj As Object)  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nShared Function GetString() As String  \n    Return \"\"  \nEnd Function  \n  \nShared Sub SetString(ByVal str As String)  \n  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nShared Sub Test()  \n    ' Covariance. A delegate specifies a return type as object,  \n    ' but you can assign a method that returns a string.  \n    Dim del As Func(Of Object) = AddressOf GetString  \n  \n    ' Contravariance. A delegate specifies a parameter type as string,  \n    ' but you can assign a method that takes an object.  \n    Dim del2 As Action(Of String) = AddressOf SetObject  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n In .NET Framework 4 or later Visual Basic support covariance and contravariance in generic interfaces and delegates and allow for implicit conversion of generic type parameters. For more information, see [Variance in Generic Interfaces (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-generic-interfaces.md) and [Variance in Delegates (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-delegates.md).  \n  \n The following code example shows implicit reference conversion for generic interfaces.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim strings As IEnumerable(Of String) = New List(Of String)  \nDim objects As IEnumerable(Of Object) = strings  \n```  \n  \n A generic interface or delegate is called *variant* if its generic parameters are declared covariant or contravariant. Visual Basic enables you to create your own variant interfaces and delegates.
