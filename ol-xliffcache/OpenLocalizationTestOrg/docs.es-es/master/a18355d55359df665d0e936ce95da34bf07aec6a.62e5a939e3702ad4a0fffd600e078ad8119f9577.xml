If this trace is being emitted in user extension code, it indicates that the user extension code is closing a message that has already been closed. If this trace is being emitted through product code, it indicates that the user extension code could potentially be closing a message too early.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,122],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 24c274d4-65cd-4c91-9869-bc6eb34ef979","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[129,167],"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"System.ServiceModel.MessageClosedAgain","pos":[168,206]},{"pos":[215,226],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"A message was closed again.","pos":[230,257]},{"content":"A message should be closed only once.","pos":[264,301]},{"content":"If this trace is being emitted in user extension code, it indicates that the user extension code is closing a message that has already been closed.","pos":[302,449]},{"content":"If this trace is being emitted through product code, it indicates that the user extension code could potentially be closing a message too early.","pos":[450,594]},{"pos":[603,611],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[615,688],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[691,844],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[847,935],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
