The example input is a URI such as http://www.contoso.com/.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example creates a cache policy that allows the requested resource to be used from the cache if it has not been in the cache for longer than one day. The example displays a message that indicates whether the resource was used from the cache—for example, `\"The response was retrieved from the cache : False.\"`—and then displays the resource. A request can be fulfilled by any cache between the client and server.  \n  \n```csharp  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Net;  \nusing System.Net.Cache;  \nusing System.IO;  \n  \nnamespace
