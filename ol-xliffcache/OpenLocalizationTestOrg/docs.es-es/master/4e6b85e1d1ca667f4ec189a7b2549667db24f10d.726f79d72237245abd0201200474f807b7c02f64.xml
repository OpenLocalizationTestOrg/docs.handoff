For more information on creating data sources from other stores of data, see [Add new data sources](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  \n  \n### To bind a control at design time  \n  \n1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control on to the form.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window:  \n  \n    1.  Expand the **(DataBindings)** node.  \n  \n    2.  Click the arrow next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property.  \n  \n         The **DataSource** UI type editor opens.  \n  \n         If a data source has previously been configured for the project or form, it will appear.  \n  \n3.  Click **Add Project Data Source** to connect to data and create a data source.  \n  \n4.  On the **Data Source Configuration Wizard** welcome page, click **Next**.  \n  \n5.  On the **Choose a Data Source Type** page, select **Database**.  \n  \n6.  On the **Choose Your Data Connection** page, select a data connection from the list of available connections. If your desired data connection is not available select **New Connection** to create a new data connection.  \n  \n7.  Select **Yes, save the connection** to save the connection string in the application configuration file.  \n  \n8.  Select the database objects to bring into your application. In this case, select a field in a table that you would like the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> to display.  \n  \n9. Replace the default dataset name if you want.  \n  \n10. Click **Finish**.  \n  \n11. In the **Properties** window, click the arrow next to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property again. In the **DataSource** UI type editor, select the name of the field to bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> to.  \n  \n     The **DataSource** UI type editor closes and the data set, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> and table adapter specific to that data connection are added to your form.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>\n- [Add new data sources](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources)\n- [Data Sources Window](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/6ckyxa83(v=vs.120))","nodes":[{"pos":[4,357],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"controls [Windows Forms], binding\"\n  - \"BindingSource component [Windows Forms], binding controls\"\n  - \"data binding [Windows Forms], BindingSource component\"\nms.assetid: 391ae170-de5c-40f8-8233-91cb2ee4683a","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","nodes":[{"pos":[0,87],"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","pos":[0,87]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[364,451],"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls with the BindingSource Component Using the Designer","pos":[0,87]}]},{"content":"After you have added controls to your form and determined the user interface for your application, you can bind the controls to a data source, so that, at run time, users can alter and save data related to the application.","pos":[452,674]},{"pos":[681,891],"content":"Binding a control or series of controls in Windows Forms is most easily accomplished using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource&gt;</ph> control as a bridge between the controls on the form and the data source.","source":"Binding a control or series of controls in Windows Forms is most easily accomplished using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control as a bridge between the controls on the form and the data source."},{"pos":[898,1051],"content":"One or more controls on a form can be bound to data; in the following procedure, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox&gt;</ph> control is bound to a data source.","source":"One or more controls on a form can be bound to data; in the following procedure, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control is bound to a data source."},{"content":"To complete the procedure, it is assumed that you will bind to a data source derived from a database.","pos":[1058,1159]},{"content":"For more information on creating data sources from other stores of data, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Add new data sources<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources)</ept>.","pos":[1160,1307],"source":" For more information on creating data sources from other stores of data, see [Add new data sources](/visualstudio/data-tools/add-new-data-sources)."},{"pos":[1315,1660],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
