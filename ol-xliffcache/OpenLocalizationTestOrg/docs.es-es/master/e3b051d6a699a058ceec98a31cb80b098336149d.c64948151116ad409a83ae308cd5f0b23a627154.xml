To paint an area with a drawing, you use a              <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> and one or more              <xref:System.Windows.Media.Drawing> objects.   The following example uses a              <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> to paint an object with a drawing of two ellipses.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xml[drawingbrush_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_snip/CS/DrawingBrushExample.xaml#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/CSharp/DrawingBrushExample.cs#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]\n [!code-vb[drawingbrush_procedural_snip#DrawingBrushExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/drawingbrush_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/DrawingBrushExample.vb#drawingbrushexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the example's output.  \n  \n ![Output from a DrawingBrush](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/media/graphicsmm-drawingbrush-simple.png \"graphicsmm_drawingbrush_simple\")  \n  \n (The center of the shape is white for reasons described in                      [Control the Fill of a Composite Shape](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-control-the-fill-of-a-composite-shape.md).)  \n  \n By setting a                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.DrawingBrush> object's                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.Viewport%2A> and                      <xref:System.Windows.Media.TileBrush.TileMode%2A> properties, you can create a repeating pattern.
