The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class is at the core of [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] functionality; it is the class that actually draws lines, curves, figures, images, and text.  \n  \n## Important Classes  \n Many classes work together with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class. For example, the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method receives a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object, which holds attributes (color, width, dash style, and the like) of the line to be drawn. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillRectangle%2A> method can receive a pointer to a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LinearGradientBrush> object, which works with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object to fill a rectangle with a gradually changing color. <xref:System.Drawing.Font> and <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat> objects influence the way a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object draws text. A <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix> object stores and manipulates the world transformation of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, which is used to rotate, scale, and flip images.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] provides several structures (for example, <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle>, <xref:System.Drawing.Point>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Size>) for organizing graphics data. Also, certain classes serve primarily as structured data types. For example, the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.BitmapData> class is a helper for the <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> class, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.PathData> class is a helper for the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> class.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] defines several enumerations, which are collections of related constants. For example, the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin> enumeration contains the elements <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin>, <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin>, and <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.LineJoin>, which specify styles that can be used to join two lines.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Graphics
