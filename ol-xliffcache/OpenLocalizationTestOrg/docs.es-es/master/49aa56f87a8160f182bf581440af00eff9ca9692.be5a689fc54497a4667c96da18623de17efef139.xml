An expression that represents a condition to test elements for. The expression must return a `Boolean` value or a functional equivalent, such as an `Integer` to be evaluated as a `Boolean`.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The `Take While` clause includes elements from the start of a query result until the supplied `expression` returns `false`. After the `expression` returns `false`, the query will bypass all remaining elements. The `expression` is ignored for the remaining results.  \n  \n The `Take While` clause differs from the `Where` clause in that the `Where` clause can be used to include all elements from a query that meet a particular condition. The `Take While` clause includes elements only until the first time that the condition is not satisfied. The `Take While` clause is most useful when you are working with an ordered query result.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example uses the `Take While` clause to retrieve results until the first customer without any orders is found.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbSimpleQuerySamples#2](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/codesnippet/VisualBasic/take-while-clause_1.vb)]  \n  \n## See
