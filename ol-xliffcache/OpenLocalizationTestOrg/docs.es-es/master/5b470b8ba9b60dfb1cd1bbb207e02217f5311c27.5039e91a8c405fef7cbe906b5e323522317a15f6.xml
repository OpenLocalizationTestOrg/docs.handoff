It also shows you how to add properties and methods to the new class, and demonstrates how to initialize an object.  \n  \n[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  \n  \n### To define a class  \n  \n1.  Create a project by clicking **New Project** on the **File** menu. The **New Project** dialog box appears.  \n  \n2.  Select Windows Application from the list of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project templates to display the new project.  \n  \n3.  Add a new class to the project by clicking **Add Class** on the **Project** menu. The **Add New Item** dialog box appears.  \n  \n4.  Select the **Class** template.  \n  \n5.  Name the new class `UserNameInfo.vb`, and then click **Add** to display the code for the new class.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#5](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_1.vb)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can use the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] **Code Editor** to add a class to your startup form by typing the `Class` keyword followed by the name of the new class. The **Code Editor** provides a corresponding `End Class` statement for you.  \n  \n6.  Define a private field for the class by adding the following code between the `Class` and `End Class` statements:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#7](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_2.vb)]  \n  \n     Declaring the field as `Private` means it can be used only within the class. You can make fields available from outside a class by using access modifiers such as `Public` that provide more access. For more information, see [Access Levels in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md).  \n  \n7.  Define a property for the class by adding the following code:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#8](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_3.vb)]  \n  \n8.  Define a method for the class by adding the following code:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#9](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_4.vb)]  \n  \n9. Define a parameterized constructor for the new class by adding a procedure named `Sub New`:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#10](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_5.vb)]  \n  \n     The `Sub New` constructor is called automatically when an object based on this class is created. This constructor sets the value of the field that holds the user name.  \n  \n### To create a button to test the class  \n  \n1.  Change the startup form to design mode by right-clicking its name in **Solution Explorer** and then clicking **View Designer**. By default, the startup form for Windows Application projects is named Form1.vb. The main form will then appear.  \n  \n2.  Add a button to the main form and double-click it to display the code for the `Button1_Click` event handler. Add the following code to call the test procedure:  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#12](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_6.vb)]  \n  \n### To run your application  \n  \n1.  Run your application by pressing F5. Click the button on the form to call the test procedure. It displays a message stating that the original `UserName` is \"MOORE, BOBBY\", because the procedure called the `Capitalize` method of the object.  \n  \n2.  Click **OK** to dismiss the message box. The `Button1 Click` procedure changes the value of the `UserName` property and displays a message stating that the new value of `UserName` is \"Worden, Joe\".  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Object-Oriented Programming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/1cf6e655-3f30-45f1-9a5d-4a88ca24a1c2)   \n [Objects and Classes](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,60],"content":"Defining Classes (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Defining Classes (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,48]}]},{"pos":[901,945],"content":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Defining Classes (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"This walkthrough demonstrates how to define classes, which you can then use to create objects.","pos":[946,1040]},{"content":"It also shows you how to add properties and methods to the new class, and demonstrates how to initialize an object.","pos":[1041,1156]},{"pos":[1299,1316],"content":"To define a class","linkify":"To define a class","nodes":[{"content":"To define a class","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Create a project by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>New Project<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>File<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[1326,1392],"source":"Create a project by clicking **New Project** on the **File** menu."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>New Project<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box appears.","pos":[1393,1432],"source":" The **New Project** dialog box appears."},{"pos":[1442,1624],"content":"Select Windows Application from the list of <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]</ph> project templates to display the new project.","source":"Select Windows Application from the list of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project templates to display the new project."},{"content":"Add a new class to the project by clicking <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add Class<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Project<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> menu.","pos":[1634,1715],"source":"Add a new class to the project by clicking **Add Class** on the **Project** menu."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add New Item<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> dialog box appears.","pos":[1716,1756],"source":" The **Add New Item** dialog box appears."},{"pos":[1766,1796],"content":"Select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Class<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> template.","source":"Select the **Class** template."},{"pos":[1806,1905],"content":"Name the new class <ph id=\"ph1\">`UserNameInfo.vb`</ph>, and then click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Add<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to display the code for the new class.","source":"Name the new class `UserNameInfo.vb`, and then click **Add** to display the code for the new class."},{"pos":[1916,2029],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-vb</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>VbVbalrOOP#5<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_1.vb)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-vb[VbVbalrOOP#5](../../../../visual-basic/misc/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-defining-classes_1.vb)]"},{"pos":[2041,2361],"content":"[!NOTE]\nYou can use the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] **Code Editor** to add a class to your startup form by typing the `Class` keyword followed by the name of the new class.
