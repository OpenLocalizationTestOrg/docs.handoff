Because conversions have to be unique, you either have to make a cast or to make one of the conversions explicit. For more information, see [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md).  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0034:  \n  \n```  \n// CS0034.cs  \npublic class A  \n{  \n   // allows for the conversion of A object to int  \n   public static implicit operator int (A s)  \n   {  \n      return 0;  \n   }  \n  \n   public static implicit operator string (A i)  \n   {  \n      return null;  \n   }  \n}  \n  \npublic class B  \n{  \n   public static implicit operator int (B s)  \n   // one way to resolve this CS0034 is to make one conversion explicit  \n   // public static explicit operator int (B s)  \n   {  \n      return 0;  \n   }  \n  \n   public static implicit operator string (B i)  \n   {  \n      return null;  \n   }  \n  \n   public static implicit operator B (string i)  \n   {  \n      return null;  \n   }  \n  \n   public static implicit operator B (int i)  \n   {  \n      return null;  \n   }  \n}  \n  \npublic class C  \n{  \n   public static void Main ()  \n   {  \n      A a = new A();  \n      B b = new B();  \n      b = b + a;   // CS0034  \n      // another way to resolve this CS0034 is to make a cast  \n      // b = b + (int)a;  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n In C# 1.1 a compiler bug made it possible to define a class that has implicit user-defined conversions to both `int` and `bool`, and to use a bitwise `AND` operator (`&`) on objects of that type. In C# 2.0, this bug was fixed to bring the compiler into compliance with the C# specification, and therefore the following code will now cause CS0034:  \n  \n```  \nnamespace CS0034  \n{  \n    class TestClass2  \n    {  \n        public void Test()  \n        {  \n            TestClass o1 = new TestClass();  \n            TestClass o2 = new TestClass();  \n            TestClass o3 = o1 & o2; //CS0034  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n    class TestClass  \n    {  \n        public static implicit operator int(TestClass o)  \n        {  \n            return 1;  \n        }  \n  \n        public static implicit operator TestClass(int v)  \n        {  \n            return new TestClass();  \n        }  \n  \n        public static implicit operator bool(TestClass o)  \n        {  \n            return true;  \n        }  \n    }  \n  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0034 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0034 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[542,563],"content":"Compiler Error CS0034","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0034","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0034","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Operator 'operator' is ambiguous on operands of type 'type1' and 'type2'","pos":[564,636]},{"content":"An operator was used on two objects and the compiler found more than one conversion.","pos":[643,727]},{"content":"Because conversions have to be unique, you either have to make a cast or to make one of the conversions explicit.","pos":[728,841]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Conversion Operators<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md)</ept>.","pos":[842,983],"source":" For more information, see [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md)."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0034:","pos":[990,1028]},{"content":"In C# 1.1 a compiler bug made it possible to define a class that has implicit user-defined conversions to both <ph id=\"ph1\">`int`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`bool`</ph>, and to use a bitwise <ph id=\"ph3\">`AND`</ph> operator (<ph id=\"ph4\">`&amp;`</ph>) on objects of that type.","pos":[2044,2239],"source":"In C# 1.1 a compiler bug made it possible to define a class that has implicit user-defined conversions to both `int` and `bool`, and to use a bitwise `AND` operator (`&`) on objects of that type."},{"content":"In C# 2.0, this bug was fixed to bring the compiler into compliance with the C# specification, and therefore the following code will now cause CS0034:","pos":[2240,2390]}]}
