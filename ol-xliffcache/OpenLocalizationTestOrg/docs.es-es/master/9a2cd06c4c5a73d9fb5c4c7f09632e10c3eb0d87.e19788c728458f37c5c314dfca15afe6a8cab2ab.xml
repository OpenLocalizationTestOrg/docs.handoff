The following table summarizes details about the essential points and related topics in this section.\n\nThe reliable session WCF provides features ensuring that messages sent between endpoints are transferred across SOAP or transport intermediaries and are delivered only once and, optionally, in the same order in which they were sent.\n\nTo use a reliable session with a WCF application, either use one of the system-provided bindings in WCF that support a reliable session by default or as an option, or create your own custom binding that supports the session.\n\n## In This Section\n\n[Reliable Sessions Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/reliable-sessions-overview.md)\nDescribes reliable sessions, when to use them, the different bindings that support reliable sessions, and how they work.\n\n[How to: Exchange Messages Within a Reliable
