On the server, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] meets the requirements of Internet-scale shared hosting providers who run third-party applications in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasplong](../../../../includes/vstecasplong-md.md)] Medium Trust permission set for security reasons. On the client, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] partial trust support is designed to meet the requirements of deployment technologies such as [ClickOnce Deployment](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83712) or [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)]'s XAML Browser Application technology, which allow seamless and secure deployment of desktop applications from untrusted sites.  \n  \n## Minimum Permission Requirements  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports a subset of features in applications running under either of the following standard named permission sets:  \n  \n-   Medium Trust permissions  \n  \n-   Internet Zone permissions  \n  \n Attempting to use [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] in partially trusted applications with more restrictive permissions may result in security exceptions at runtime.  \n  \n For more information about the features supported in these permission sets, see [Partial Trust Feature Compatibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/partial-trust-feature-compatibility.md).  \n  \n## Partial Trust on the Server  \n Many commercial providers of [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Web application hosting services mandate that applications running on their servers run in the [!INCLUDE[vstecasplong](../../../../includes/vstecasplong-md.md)] Medium Trust permission set. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services can run in these environments provided they use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>, the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding>, or the <<!--zz xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding --> `xref:System.ServiceModel.WsHttpBinding`> with transport-level security.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services running in Medium Trust hosting environments can also act as middle-tier services by sending messages to other servers in response to client requests. Middle-tier scenarios on the server are supported if the hosting environment has granted the application the appropriate <xref:System.Net.WebPermission> to make outbound requests to the desired server.  \n  \n In addition to SOAP messaging using one of the supported SOAP bindings, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> for building Web-style services in partially trusted applications. The [WCF Web HTTP Programming Model](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-web-http-programming-model.md), [WCF Syndication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-syndication.md), and [AJAX Integration and JSON Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/ajax-integration-and-json-support.md) features of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] are all supported in partial trust.  \n  \n Workflow Services require Full Trust permissions and cannot be used in partially trusted applications.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] [How to: Use Medium Trust in ASP.NET 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=84603).  \n  \n## Partial Trust on the Client  \n Certain security precautions must be taken when downloading and running code from untrusted Internet sites. Both [ClickOnce Deployment](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83712) and [!INCLUDE[avalon2](../../../../includes/avalon2-md.md)]'s XAML Browser Application (XBAP) technology make use of partial trust to grant limited permissions (Internet Zone) to untrusted code.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] can be used to communicate with remote servers from within partially trusted applications deployed by either [ClickOnce Deployment](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=83712) or XBAP. The Internet Zone permission set includes <xref:System.Net.WebPermission> for the originating host, which allows these applications to communicate with their origin server using any of the supported [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] bindings described in [Partial Trust Feature
