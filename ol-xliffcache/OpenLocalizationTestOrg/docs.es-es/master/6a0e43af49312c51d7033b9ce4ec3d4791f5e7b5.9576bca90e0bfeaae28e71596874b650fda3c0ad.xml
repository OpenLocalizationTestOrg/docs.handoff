The following sections describe the scenarios and configurations that Windows Forms applications and controls support and those that they do not support.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Windows Forms and Unmanaged Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-and-unmanaged-applications-overview.md)  \n Offers general information about how to use and implement Windows Forms controls that work with unmanaged applications.  \n  \n [How to: Support COM Interop by Displaying a Windows Form with the ShowDialog Method](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/com-interop-by-displaying-a-windows-form-shadow.md)  \n Provides a code example that shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to run a Windows Form in an unmanaged application.  \n  \n [How to: Support COM Interop by Displaying Each Windows Form on Its Own Thread](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-support-com-interop-by-displaying-each-windows-form-on-its-own-thread.md)  \n Provides a code example that shows how to run a Windows Form on its own thread.  \n  \n Also see [Walkthrough: Supporting COM Interop by Displaying Each Windows Form on Its Own Thread](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms233639\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.ShowDialog%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n Used to create a separate thread for a Windows Form.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.Run%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n Starts a message loop for a thread.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke%2A>  \n Marshals calls from an unmanaged application to a form.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Exposing .NET Framework Components to COM](../../../../docs/framework/interop/exposing-dotnet-components-to-com.md)  \n Offers general information about how to use .NET Framework types in unmanaged applications.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,69],"content":"Windows Forms and Unmanaged Applications | Microsoft
