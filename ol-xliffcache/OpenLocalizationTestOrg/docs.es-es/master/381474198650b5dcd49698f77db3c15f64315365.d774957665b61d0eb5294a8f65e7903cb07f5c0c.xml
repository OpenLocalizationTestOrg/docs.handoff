Use constants to provide meaningful names instead of numeric literals (\"magic numbers\") for special values.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In C# the [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md) preprocessor directive cannot be used to define constants in the way that is typically used in C and C++.  \n  \n To define constant values of integral types (`int`, `byte`, and so on) use an enumerated type. For more information, see [enum](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum.md).  \n  \n To define non-integral constants, one approach is to group them in a single static class named `Constants`. This will require that all references to the constants be prefaced with the class name, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#89](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-define-constants_1.cs)]  \n  \n The use of the class name qualifier helps ensure that you and others who use the constant understand that it is constant and cannot be modified.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"How to: Define Constants in C# | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Constants in C# | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[558,588],"content":"How to: Define Constants in C#","linkify":"How to: Define Constants in C#","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Constants in C#","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"Constants are fields whose values are set at compile time and can never be changed.","pos":[589,672]},{"content":"Use constants to provide meaningful names instead of numeric literals (\"magic numbers\") for special values.","pos":[673,780]},{"pos":[788,1007],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In C# the [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md) preprocessor directive cannot be used to define constants in the way that is typically used in C and C++.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"In C# the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#define<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md)</ept> preprocessor directive cannot be used to define constants in the way that is typically used in C and C++.","pos":[9,217],"source":" In C# the [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md) preprocessor directive cannot be used to define constants in the way that is typically used in C and C++."}]},{"content":"To define constant values of integral types (<ph id=\"ph1\">`int`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`byte`</ph>, and so on) use an enumerated type.","pos":[1014,1108],"source":"To define constant values of integral types (`int`, `byte`, and so on) use an enumerated type."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>enum<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum.md)</ept>.","pos":[1109,1195],"source":" For more information, see [enum](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum.md)."},{"content":"To define non-integral constants, one approach is to group them in a single static class named <ph id=\"ph1\">`Constants`</ph>.","pos":[1202,1309],"source":"To define non-integral constants, one approach is to group them in a single static class named `Constants`."},{"content":"This will require that all references to the constants be prefaced with the class name, as shown in the following example.","pos":[1310,1432]},{"pos":[1441,1448],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1452,1588],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csProgGuideObjects#89<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-define-constants_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csProgGuideObjects#89](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-define-constants_1.cs)]"},{"content":"The use of the class name qualifier helps ensure that you and others who use the constant understand that it is constant and cannot be modified.","pos":[1595,1739]},{"pos":[1748,1756],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1760,1845],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Classes and Structs<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Classes and Structs](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/index.md)"}]}
