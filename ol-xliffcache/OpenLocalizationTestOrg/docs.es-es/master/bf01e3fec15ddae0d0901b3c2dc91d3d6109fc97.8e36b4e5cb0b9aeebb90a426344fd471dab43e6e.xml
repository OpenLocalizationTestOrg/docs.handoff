Discovery feature.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Announcements](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/announcements-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use announcements with the discovery feature.  \n  \n [Basic](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to make a service discoverable programmatically as well as search for that service using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DynamicEndpoint>.  \n  \n [Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/configuration-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use a configuration file to make a service discoverable as well as how to use a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DynamicEndpoint> through configuration to look for that service.  \n  \n [Discovery with Scopes](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-with-scopes-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use scopes to categorize discoverable endpoints as well how to use <xref:System.ServiceModel.Discovery.DiscoveryClient> to perform an asynchronous search for endpoints.  \n  \n [Custom Find Criteria](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-find-criteria.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a custom scope match using logic and how to implement a custom discovery service.  \n  \n [Workflow Discovery Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/workflow-discovery-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates how to make a workflow service discoverable and how to author a custom code activity that searches for a particular service.  \n  \n [Discovery Router Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/discovery-router-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to forward discovery messages to another endpoint.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,103],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Discovery (Samples)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid:
