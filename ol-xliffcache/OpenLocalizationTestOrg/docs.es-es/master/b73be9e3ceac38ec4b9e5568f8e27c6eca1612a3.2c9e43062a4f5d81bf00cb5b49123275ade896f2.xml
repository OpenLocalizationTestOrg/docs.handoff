The [F# Getting Started](../fsharp/tutorials/getting-started/index.md) tutorials provide three primary ways you can use F#: with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or command-line tools.\n\n* The [Visual Basic Getting Started](../visual-basic/getting-started/index.md) articles provide guides for using Visual Basic in Visual Studio, and provide a number of other learning resources.\n\n## Get started using .NET core\n\n* [Getting Started with .NET Core](../core/get-started.md) provides an overview of articles which show how to get started with .NET Core on different operating systems and using different tools.\n\n* The [.NET Core Tutorials](../core/tutorials/index.md) detail a number of ways you can get started with .NET Core using your operating system and tooling of choice.\n\n## Get started using Docker on .NET Framework\n\nThe [Docker on .NET Framework](../framework/docker/index.md) shows how you can use .NET Framework on Windows Docker
