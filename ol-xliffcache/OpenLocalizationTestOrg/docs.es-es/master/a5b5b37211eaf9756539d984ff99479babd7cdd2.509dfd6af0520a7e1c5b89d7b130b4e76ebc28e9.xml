The following procedure shows how to print a form, including both the client area and the non-client area. The non-client area includes the title bar, borders, and scroll bars.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n### To print both the client and the non-client areas of a form  \n  \n1.  In the **Toolbox**, click the **Visual Basic PowerPacks** tab and then drag the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component onto the form.  \n  \n     The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm> component is added to the component tray.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A> property to <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintAction>.  \n  \n3.  Add the following code in the appropriate event handler (for example, in the `Click` event handler for a Print `Button`).  \n  \n    ```  \n    PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.FullWindow)  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  On some operating systems, text or graphics drawn by <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> methods may not print correctly. In this case, use the compatible printing method: `PrintForm1.Print(Me, PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintOption.CompatibleModeFullWindow`).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.PrintAction%2A>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.Printing.PrintForm.Print%2A>   \n [PrintForm Component](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/printform-component.md)   \n [How to: Print a Scrollable Form](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/printing/how-to-print-a-scrollable-form.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,696],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,83],"content":"How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,83]}]}],"pos":[6,92],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Print Client and Non-Client Areas of a Form (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
