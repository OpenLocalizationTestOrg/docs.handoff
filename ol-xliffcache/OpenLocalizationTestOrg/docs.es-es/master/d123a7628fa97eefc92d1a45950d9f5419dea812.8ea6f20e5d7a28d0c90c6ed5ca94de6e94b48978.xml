This topic explains how to set up an application so that it logs security events. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)][!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] auditing, see [Auditing](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/auditing-security-events.md).  \n  \n### To audit security events in code  \n  \n1.  Specify the audit log location. To do this, set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.AuditLogLocation%2A> property of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> class to one of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLogLocation> enumeration values, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[AuditingSecurityEvents#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/cs/auditingsecurityevents.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/vb/auditingsecurityevents.vb#2)]  \n  \n     The <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLogLocation> enumeration has three values: `Application`, `Security`, or `Default`. The value specifies one of the logs visible in the Event Viewer, either the Security log or the Application log. If you use the `Default` value, the actual log will depend on the operating system the application is running on. If auditing is enabled and the log location is not specified, the default is the `Security` log for platforms that support writing to the Security log; otherwise, it will write to the `Application` log. Only [!INCLUDE[ws2003](../../../../includes/ws2003-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)] support writing to the Security log by default.  \n  \n2.  Set up the types of events to audit. You can simultaneously audit service-level events or message-level authorization events. To do this, set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.ServiceAuthorizationAuditLevel%2A> property or the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.MessageAuthenticationAuditLevel%2A> property to one of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLevel> enumeration values, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[AuditingSecurityEvents#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/cs/auditingsecurityevents.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/vb/auditingsecurityevents.vb#3)]  \n  \n3.  Specify whether to suppress or expose failures to the application regarding log audit events. Set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.SuppressAuditFailure%2A> property to either `true` or `false`, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[AuditingSecurityEvents#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/cs/auditingsecurityevents.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/vb/auditingsecurityevents.vb#4)]  \n  \n     The default `SuppressAuditFailure` property is `true`, so that the failure to audit does not affect the application. Otherwise, an exception is thrown. For any successful audit, a verbose trace is written. For any failure to audit, the trace is written at the Error level.  \n  \n4.  Delete the existing <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> from the collection of behaviors found in the description of a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost>. The behavior collection is accessed by the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceDescription.Behaviors%2A> property, which in turn is accessed from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHostBase.Description%2A> property. Then add the new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior>to the same collection, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[AuditingSecurityEvents#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/cs/auditingsecurityevents.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/vb/auditingsecurityevents.vb#5)]  \n  \n### To set up auditing in configuration  \n  \n1.  To set up auditing in configuration, add a [\\<behavior>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/behavior-of-endpointbehaviors.md) element to the [\\<behaviors>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/behaviors.md) section of the web.config file. Then add a [\\<serviceSecurityAudit>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/servicesecurityaudit.md) element and set the various attributes, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <behaviors>  \n       <behavior name=\"myAuditBehavior\">  \n          <serviceSecurityAudit auditLogLocation=\"Application\"  \n                suppressAuditFailure=\"false\"   \n                serviceAuthorizationAuditLevel=\"None\"   \n                messageAuthenticationAuditLevel=\"SuccessOrFailure\" />  \n          </behavior>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  You must specify the behavior for the service, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <services>  \n        <service type=\"WCS.Samples.Service.Echo\"   \n        behaviorConfiguration=\" myAuditBehavior\">  \n           <endpoint address=\"\"  \n                    binding=\"wsHttpBinding\"  \n                    bindingConfiguration=\"CertificateDefault\"   \n                    contract=\"WCS.Samples.Service.IEcho\" />  \n        </service>  \n    </services>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code creates an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> class and adds a new <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> to its collection of behaviors.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[AuditingSecurityEvents#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/cs/auditingsecurityevents.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[AuditingSecurityEvents#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/auditingsecurityevents/vb/auditingsecurityevents.vb#1)]  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.SuppressAuditFailure%2A> property to `true`, suppresses any failure to generate security audits (if set to `false`, an exception is thrown). However, if you enable the following Windows **Local Security Setting**property, a failure to generate audit events will cause Windows to shut down immediately:  \n  \n **Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits**  \n  \n To set the property, open the **Local Security Settings** dialog box. Under **Security Settings**, click **Local Policies**. Then click **Security Options**.  \n  \n If the <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLogLocation> property is set to <xref:System.ServiceModel.AuditLogLocation> and **Audit Object Access** is not set in the **Local Security Policy**, audit events will not be written to the Security log. Note that no failure is returned, but audit entries are not written to the Security log.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior.AuditLogLocation%2A>
