However, for the type of a null literal to be inferred correctly, [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] imposes certain constraints on where a null literal can be used.  \n  \n## Typed Nulls  \n Typed nulls can be used anywhere. Type inference is not required for typed nulls because the type is known. For example, you can construct a null of type Int16 with the following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] construct:  \n  \n `(cast(null as Int16))`  \n  \n## Free-Floating Null Literals  \n Free-floating null literals can be used in the following contexts:  \n  \n-   As an argument to a CAST or TREAT expression. This is the recommended way to produce a typed null expression.  \n  \n-   As an argument to a method or a function. Standard overload rules apply.  \n  \n-   As one of the arguments to an arithmetic expression such as +, -, or /. The other arguments cannot be null literals, otherwise type inference is not possible.  \n  \n-   As any of the arguments to a logical expression (AND, OR, or NOT). All the arguments are known to be of type Boolean.  \n  \n-   As the argument to an IS NULL or IS NOT NULL expression.  \n  \n-   As one or more of the arguments to a LIKE expression. All arguments are expected to be strings.  \n  \n-   As one or more of the arguments to a named-type constructor.  \n  \n-   As one or more of the arguments to a multiset constructor. At least one argument to the multiset constructor must be an expression that is not a null literal.  \n  \n-   As one or more of the THEN or ELSE expressions in a CASE expression. At least one of the THEN or ELSE expressions in the CASE expression must be an expression other than a null literal.  \n  \n Free-floating null literals cannot be used in other scenarios. For example,  they cannot be used as arguments to a row constructor.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,129],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: edd56afb-af1b-4e7d-b210-cb8998143426","nodes":[{"content":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[136,181],"content":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","linkify":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"Null Literals and Type Inference (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"Null literals are compatible with any type in the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> type system.","pos":[182,300],"source":"Null literals are compatible with any type in the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] type system."},{"content":"However, for the type of a null literal to be inferred correctly, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> imposes certain constraints on where a null literal can be used.","pos":[301,487],"source":" However, for the type of a null literal to be inferred correctly, [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] imposes certain constraints on where a null literal can be used."},{"pos":[496,507],"content":"Typed Nulls","linkify":"Typed Nulls","nodes":[{"content":"Typed Nulls","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Typed nulls can be used anywhere.","pos":[511,544]},{"content":"Type inference is not required for typed nulls because the type is known.","pos":[545,618]},{"content":"For example, you can construct a null of type Int16 with the following <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> construct:","pos":[619,756],"source":" For example, you can construct a null of type Int16 with the following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] construct:"},{"pos":[795,822],"content":"Free-Floating Null Literals","linkify":"Free-Floating Null Literals","nodes":[{"content":"Free-Floating Null Literals","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"Free-floating null literals can be used in the following contexts:","pos":[826,892]},{"content":"As an argument to a CAST or TREAT expression.","pos":[902,947]},{"content":"This is the recommended way to produce a typed null expression.","pos":[948,1011]},{"content":"As an argument to a method or a function.","pos":[1021,1062]},{"content":"Standard overload rules apply.","pos":[1063,1093]},{"content":"As one of the arguments to an arithmetic expression such as +, -, or /.","pos":[1103,1174]},{"content":"The other arguments cannot be null literals, otherwise type inference is not possible.","pos":[1175,1261]},{"content":"As any of the arguments to a logical expression (AND, OR, or NOT).","pos":[1271,1337]},{"content":"All the arguments are known to be of type Boolean.","pos":[1338,1388]},{"content":"As the argument to an IS NULL or IS NOT NULL expression.","pos":[1398,1454]},{"content":"As one or more of the arguments to a LIKE expression.","pos":[1464,1517]},{"content":"All arguments are expected to be strings.","pos":[1518,1559]},{"content":"As one or more of the arguments to a named-type constructor.","pos":[1569,1629]},{"content":"As one or more of the arguments to a multiset constructor.","pos":[1639,1697]},{"content":"At least one argument to the multiset constructor must be an expression that is not a null literal.","pos":[1698,1797]},{"content":"As one or more of the THEN or ELSE expressions in a CASE expression.","pos":[1807,1875]},{"content":"At least one of the THEN or ELSE expressions in the CASE expression must be an expression other than a null literal.","pos":[1876,1992]},{"content":"Free-floating null literals cannot be used in other scenarios.","pos":[1999,2061]},{"content":"For example,  they cannot be used as arguments to a row constructor.","pos":[2062,2130]},{"pos":[2139,2147],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2151,2263],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)"}]}
