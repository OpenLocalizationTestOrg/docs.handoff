In real-world code, the loop typically contains additional processing steps that add to the total query execution time. Notice that the stopwatch is not started until just before the loop, because that is when the query execution begins. If you require more fine-grained measurement, you can use the `ElapsedTicks` property instead of `ElapsedMilliseconds`.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PLINQ#19](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/plinq/cs/measure2.cs#19)]\n [!code-vb[PLINQ#19](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/plinq/vb/measure2.vb#19)]  \n  \n The total execution time is a useful metric when you are experimenting with query implementations, but it does not always tell the whole story. To get a deeper and richer view of the interaction of the query threads with one another and with other running processes, use the Concurrency Visualizer.
