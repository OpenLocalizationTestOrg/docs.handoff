If the specified file does not exist, it is created.  \n  \n## Procedure  \n  \n#### To write text to a file  \n  \n-   Use the `WriteAllText` method to write text to a file, specifying the file and text to be written. This example writes the line `\"This is new text.\"` to the file named `test.txt`, appending the text to any existing text in the file.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOWrite#3](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-text-to-files_1.vb)]  \n  \n#### To write a series of strings to a file  \n  \n-   Loop through the string collection. Use the `WriteAllText` method to write text to a file, specifying the target file and string to be added and setting `append` to `True`.  \n  \n     This example writes the names of the files in the `Documents and Settings` directory to `FileList.txt`, inserting a carriage return between each for better readability.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbFileIOWrite#4](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-write-text-to-files_2.vb)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\\\\\.\\\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   `File` points to a path that does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException> or <xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   The file is in use by another process, or an I/O error occurs (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n-   The disk is full, and the call to `WriteAllText` fails (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n If you are running in a partial-trust context, the code might throw an exception due to insufficient privileges.
