Doing so would produce an ambiguity about which version to access.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32123  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change one of the type arguments supplied to the derived interface so that there is no conflict.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Remove from the `Inherits` statement one of the interfaces causing the potential inheritance or implementation conflict.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Interface Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/interface-statement.md)\n- [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n- [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,343],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Cannot inherit interface '<interfacename1>' because it could be identical to interface '<interfacename2>' from which the interface '<interfacename3>' inherits for some type arguments\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
