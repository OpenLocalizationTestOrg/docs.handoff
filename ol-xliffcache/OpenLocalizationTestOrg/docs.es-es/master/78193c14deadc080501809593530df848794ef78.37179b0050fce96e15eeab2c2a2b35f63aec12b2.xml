To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `IsNot` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim number? As Integer = 5  \n  \nIf number IsNot Nothing Then  \n  If number.GetType() IsNot Type.GetType(\"System.Int32\") Then   \n  \n  End If  \nEnd If  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Nullable Value Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)   \n [IsNot Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,168],"content":"&#39;IsNot&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;IsNot&amp;#39; operand of type &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; can only be compared to &amp;#39;Nothing&amp;#39;, because &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,156],"source":"&#39;IsNot&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[706,845],"content":"&#39;IsNot&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type","linkify":"&#39;IsNot&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type","nodes":[{"content":"&amp;#39;IsNot&amp;#39; operand of type &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; can only be compared to &amp;#39;Nothing&amp;#39;, because &amp;#39;typename&amp;#39; is a nullable type","pos":[0,139],"source":"&#39;IsNot&#39; operand of type &#39;typename&#39; can only be compared to &#39;Nothing&#39;, because &#39;typename&#39; is a nullable type"}]},{"pos":[846,961],"content":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`IsNot`</ph> operator.","source":"A variable declared as nullable has been compared to an expression other than `Nothing` using the `IsNot` operator."},{"pos":[968,989],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32128","source":"**Error ID:** BC32128"},{"pos":[998,1019],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1029,1248],"content":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`Nothing`</ph> by using the <ph id=\"ph2\">`IsNot`</ph> operator, call the <ph id=\"ph3\">`GetType`</ph> method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example.","source":"To compare a nullable type to an expression other than `Nothing` by using the `IsNot` operator, call the `GetType` method on the nullable type and compare the result to the expression, as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[1425,1433],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Nullable Value Types<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1437,1554],"source":"[Nullable Value Types](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/nullable-value-types.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>IsNot Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md)</ept>","pos":[1557,1644],"source":" [IsNot Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isnot-operator.md)"}]}
