It tries to find a single version with a parameter list that matches the delegate parameter list. For more information, see [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md).  \n  \n If the compiler finds more than one version of the procedure with a matching signature, it generates this error. This can happen, for example, if one of the overloads is generic and a type argument is passed to it that gives it a signature identical to that of another overload.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30794  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the conflict is caused by a generic overload having the same signature as another overload, change the type argument passed to that generic overload.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)\n- [Delegate Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)\n\n- [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)\n- [Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,226],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"No accessible '<procedurename>' is most specific: <signaturelist>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30794\"\n  - \"BC30794\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30794\"\nms.assetid: 51d54cbb-b530-4661-9952-5ccc17e4220b","nodes":[{"content":"No accessible '<procedurename>' is most specific: <signaturelist>","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"No accessible '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;procedurename&gt;</ph>' is most specific: <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;signaturelist&gt;</ph>","source":"No accessible '<procedurename>' is most specific: <signaturelist>"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[233,300],"content":"No accessible '\\<procedurename>' is most specific: \\<signaturelist>","linkify":"No accessible '\\<procedurename>' is most specific: \\<signaturelist>","nodes":[{"content":"No accessible '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>procedurename&gt;' is most specific: <ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>signaturelist&gt;","pos":[0,67],"source":"No accessible '\\<procedurename>' is most specific: \\<signaturelist>"}]},{"content":"An assignment statement assigns the address of an overloaded procedure to a delegate variable, but the compiler cannot resolve among the overloaded versions.","pos":[301,458]},{"content":"When code uses the address of a procedure that is defined in several overloaded versions, the compiler must decide which of the overloads to use.","pos":[465,610]},{"content":"It tries to find a single version with a parameter list that matches the delegate parameter list.","pos":[611,708]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overload Resolution<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)</ept>.","pos":[709,847],"source":" For more information, see [Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)."},{"content":"If the compiler finds more than one version of the procedure with a matching signature, it generates this error.","pos":[854,966]},{"content":"This can happen, for example, if one of the overloads is generic and a type argument is passed to it that gives it a signature identical to that of another overload.","pos":[967,1132]},{"pos":[1139,1160],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30794","source":"**Error ID:** BC30794"},{"pos":[1169,1190],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"If the conflict is caused by a generic overload having the same signature as another overload, change the type argument passed to that generic overload.","pos":[1200,1352]},{"pos":[1361,1369],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1373,1464],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>AddressOf Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[AddressOf Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/addressof-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1467,1559],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Delegate Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Delegate Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/delegate-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1563,1674],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overload Resolution<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)</ept>","source":"[Overload Resolution](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/overload-resolution.md)"},{"pos":[1677,1792],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Generic Types in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Generic Types in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/generic-types.md)"}]}
