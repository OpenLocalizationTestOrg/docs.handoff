They do not compare the values of two objects; they check only to determine whether two object variables refer to the same object instance.  \n  \n## Associativity  \n When operators of equal precedence appear together in an expression, for example multiplication and division, the compiler evaluates each operation as it encounters it from left to right. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```  \nDim n1 As Integer = 96 / 8 / 4  \nDim n2 As Integer = (96 / 8) / 4  \nDim n3 As Integer = 96 / (8 / 4)  \n```  \n  \n The first expression evaluates the division 96 / 8 (which results in 12) and then the division 12 / 4, which results in three. Because the compiler evaluates the operations for `n1` from left to right, the evaluation is the same when that order is explicitly indicated for `n2`. Both `n1` and `n2` have a result of three. By contrast, `n3` has a result of 48, because the parentheses force the compiler to evaluate 8 / 4 first.  \n  \n Because of this behavior, operators are said to be *left associative* in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n## Overriding Precedence and Associativity  \n You can use parentheses to force some parts of an expression to be evaluated before others. This can override both the order of precedence and the left associativity. [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] always performs operations that are enclosed in parentheses before those outside. However, within parentheses, it maintains ordinary precedence and associativity, unless you use parentheses within the parentheses. The following example illustrates this.  \n  \n```  \nDim a, b, c, d, e, f, g As Double  \na = 8.0  \nb = 3.0  \nc = 4.0  \nd = 2.0  \ne = 1.0  \nf = a - b + c / d * e  \n' The preceding line sets f to 7.0. Because of natural operator   \n' precedence and associativity, it is exactly equivalent to the   \n' following line.  \nf = (a - b) + ((c / d) * e)  \n' The following line overrides the natural operator precedence   \n' and left associativity.  \ng = (a - (b + c)) / (d * e)  \n' The preceding line sets g to 0.5.  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [=
