With the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, you can bind to such data sources and raise a change notification from your code.  \n  \n## Example  \n This form demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind a list to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. The list does not raise change notifications, so the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.ResetItem%2A> method on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is called when an item in the list is changed. .  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem#1](~/samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem/CPP/form1.cpp#1)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.ResetItem/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md). You can also build this example in Visual Studio by pasting the code into a new project.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>\n- [BindingSource Component](bindingsource-component.md)\n- [How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Type](how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,496],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Raise Change Notifications Using the BindingSource ResetItem Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
