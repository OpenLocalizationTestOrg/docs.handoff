Constraints are configured for an activity during the authoring process, but additional constraints can also be specified by the workflow host. This topic provides an overview of using declarative constraints to provide activity validation.  \n  \n## Using Declarative Constraints  \n A constraint is an activity that contains validation logic. This constraint activity can be authored in code or in XAML. After a constraint activity is created, activity authors add this constraint to the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.Constraints%2A> property of the activity to validate, or they use the constraint to provide additional validation by using the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings.AdditionalConstraints%2A> property of a <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings> instance. The validation logic can consist of simple validations such as validating an activityâ€™s metadata, but it can also perform validation that takes into account the relationship of the current activity to its parent, children, and sibling activities. Constraints are authored by using the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.Constraint%601> activity, and several additional validation activities are provided to assist with the creation of validation errors and warnings and to provide information about related activities in the workflow.  \n  \n### AssertValidation and AddValidationError  \n The <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation> activity evaluates the expression referenced by its <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation.Assertion%2A> property, and if the expression evaluates to `false`, a validation error or warning is added to the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationResults>. The <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation.Message%2A> property describes the validation error and the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation.IsWarning%2A> property indicates whether the validation failure is an error or a warning. The default value for <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation.IsWarning%2A> is `false`.  \n  \n In the following example, a constraint is declared that returns a validation warning if the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of the activity being validated is two characters or less in length. The generic type parameter used for <xref:System.Activities.Validation.Constraint%601> specifies the type of activity that is validated by the constraint. This constraint uses <xref:System.Activities.Activity> as the generic type and can be used to validate all types of activities.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic static Constraint ActivityDisplayNameIsNotSetWarning()  \n{  \n    DelegateInArgument<Activity> element = new DelegateInArgument<Activity>();  \n  \n    return new Constraint<Activity>  \n    {  \n        Body = new ActivityAction<Activity, ValidationContext>  \n        {  \n            Argument1 = element,  \n            Handler = new AssertValidation  \n            {  \n                IsWarning = true,  \n                Assertion = new InArgument<bool>(env => (element.Get(env).DisplayName.Length > 2)),  \n                Message = new InArgument<string>(\"It is a best practice to have a DisplayName of more than 2 characters.\"),  \n            }  \n        }  \n    };  \n}  \n```  \n  \n To specify this constraint for an activity, it is added to the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.Constraints%2A> of the activity, as shown in the following example code.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic sealed class SampleActivity : CodeActivity  \n{  \n    public SampleActivity()  \n    {  \n        base.Constraints.Add(ActivityDisplayNameIsNotSetWarning());  \n    }  \n  \n    // Activity implementation omitted.  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The host could also specify this constraint for activities in a workflow by using <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings.AdditionalConstraints%2A>, which is covered in the next section.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AddValidationError> activity is used to generate a validation error or warning without requiring the evaluation of an expression. Its properties are similar to <xref:System.Activities.Validation.AssertValidation> and it can be used in conjunction with flow control activities of a constraint such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.If> activity.  \n  \n### Workflow Relationship Activities  \n Several validation activities are available that provide information about the other activities in the workflow in relation to the activity being validated. <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetParentChain> returns a collection of activities that contains all of the activities between the current activity and the root activity. <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetChildSubtree> provides a collection of activities that contains the child activities in a recursive pattern, and <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetWorkflowTree> gets all the activities in the workflow.  \n  \n In the following example from the [Activity Relationships Validation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/activity-relationships-validation.md) sample, a `CreateState` activity is defined. The `CreateState` activity must be contained within a `CreateCountry` activity, and the `GetParent` method returns a constraint that enforces this requirement. `GetParent` uses the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.GetParentChain> activity in conjunction with a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.ForEach%601> activity to inspect the parent activities of the `CreateState` activity to determine if the requirement is met.  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic sealed class CreateState : CodeActivity  \n{  \n    public CreateState()  \n    {  \n        base.Constraints.Add(CheckParent());  \n        this.Cities = new List<Activity>();              \n    }  \n  \n    public List<Activity> Cities { get; set; }  \n  \n    public string Name { get; set; }    \n  \n    static Constraint CheckParent()  \n    {  \n        DelegateInArgument<CreateState> element = new DelegateInArgument<CreateState>();  \n        DelegateInArgument<ValidationContext> context = new DelegateInArgument<ValidationContext>();                          \n        Variable<bool> result = new Variable<bool>();  \n        DelegateInArgument<Activity> parent = new DelegateInArgument<Activity>();  \n  \n        return new Constraint<CreateState>  \n        {                                     \n            Body = new ActivityAction<CreateState,ValidationContext>  \n            {                      \n                Argument1 = element,  \n                Argument2 = context,  \n                Handler = new Sequence  \n                {  \n                    Variables =  \n                    {  \n                        result   \n                    },  \n                    Activities =  \n                    {  \n                        new ForEach<Activity>  \n                        {                                  \n                            Values = new GetParentChain  \n                            {  \n                                ValidationContext = context                                      \n                            },  \n                            Body = new ActivityAction<Activity>  \n                            {     \n                                Argument = parent,   \n                                Handler = new If()  \n                                {                                            \n                                    Condition = new InArgument<bool>((env) => object.Equals(parent.Get(env).GetType(),typeof(CreateCountry))),                                          \n                                    Then = new Assign<bool>  \n                                    {  \n                                        Value = true,  \n                                        To = result  \n                                    }  \n                                }  \n                            }                                  \n                        },  \n                        new AssertValidation  \n                        {  \n                            Assertion = new InArgument<bool>(result),  \n                            Message = new InArgument<string> (\"CreateState has to be inside a CreateCountry activity\"),                                                                  \n                        }  \n                    }  \n                }  \n            }  \n        };  \n    }  \n  \n    protected override void Execute(CodeActivityContext context)  \n    {  \n        // not needed for the sample  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)] the Windows Workflow Foundation [Validation](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/validation.md) samples.  \n  \n## Additional Constraints  \n Workflow host authors can specify additional validation constraints for activities in a workflow by creating constraints and adding them to the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings.AdditionalConstraints%2A> dictionary of a <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings> instance. Each item in <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings.AdditionalConstraints%2A> contains the type of activity for which the constraints apply and a list of the additional constraints for that type of activity. When validation is invoked for the workflow, each activity of the specified type, including derived classes, evaluates the constraints. In this example, the `ActivityDisplayNameIsNotSetWarning` constraint from the previous section is applied to all activities in a workflow.  \n  \n```csharp  \nActivity wf = new Sequence  \n{  \n    // Workflow Details Omitted.  \n};  \n  \nValidationSettings settings = new ValidationSettings()  \n{  \n  \n    AdditionalConstraints =  \n    {  \n        {typeof(Activity), new List<Constraint> {ActivityDisplayNameIsNotSetWarning()}},       \n    }  \n};  \n  \n// Validate the workflow.  \nValidationResults results = ActivityValidationServices.Validate(wf, settings);  \n  \n// Evaluate the results.  \nif (results.Errors.Count == 0 && results.Warnings.Count == 0)  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"No warnings or errors\");  \n}  \nelse  \n{  \n    foreach (ValidationError error in results.Errors)  \n    {  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Error in \" + error.Source.DisplayName + \": \" + error.Message);  \n    }  \n    foreach (ValidationError warning in results.Warnings)  \n    {  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Warning in \" + warning.Source.DisplayName + \": \" + warning.Message);  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n If the <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings.OnlyUseAdditionalConstraints%2A> property of <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ValidationSettings> is `true`, then only the specified additional constraints are evaluated when validation is invoked by calling <xref:System.Activities.Validation.ActivityValidationServices.Validate%2A>. This can be useful for inspecting workflows for specific validation configurations. Note however that when the workflow is invoked, the validation logic configured in the workflow is evaluated and must pass for the workflow to successfully begin.
