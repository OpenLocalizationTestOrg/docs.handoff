A shared variable identifies exactly one storage location. A variable declared with the `WithEvents` modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises. When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the `WithEvents` declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the `Add` method.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30594  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Declare your event handler `Shared`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Shared](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)   \n [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,106],"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,94]}]},{"pos":[644,721],"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","linkify":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","nodes":[{"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","pos":[0,77]}]},{"content":"A variable declared with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Shared`</ph> modifier is a shared variable.","pos":[722,790],"source":"A variable declared with the `Shared` modifier is a shared variable."},{"content":"A shared variable identifies exactly one storage location.","pos":[791,849]},{"content":"A variable declared with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises.","pos":[850,999],"source":" A variable declared with the `WithEvents` modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises."},{"content":"When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Add`</ph> method.","pos":[1000,1186],"source":" When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the `WithEvents` declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the `Add` method."},{"pos":[1193,1214],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30594","source":"**Error ID:** BC30594"},{"pos":[1223,1244],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1254,1290],"content":"Declare your event handler <ph id=\"ph1\">`Shared`</ph>.","source":"Declare your event handler `Shared`."},{"pos":[1299,1307],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1311,1382],"source":"[Shared](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>WithEvents<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)</ept>","pos":[1385,1464],"source":" [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)"}]}
