To create a service, write a class that implements a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) contract. You can do this in one of two ways. You can define the contract separately as an interface and then create a class that implements that interface. Alternatively, you can create the class and contract directly by placing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute on the class itself and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute on the methods available to the clients of the service.  \n  \n## Creating a service class  \n The following is an example of a service that implements an `IMath` contract that has been defined separately.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Define the IMath contract.  \n[ServiceContract]  \npublic interface IMath  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]   \n    double Add(double A, double B);  \n  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    double Multiply (double A, double B);  \n}  \n  \n// Implement the IMath contract in the MathService class.  \npublic class MathService : IMath  \n{  \n    public double Add (double A, double B) { return A + B; }  \n    public double Multiply (double A, double B) { return A * B; }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n Alternatively, a service can expose a contract directly. The following is an example of a service class that defines and implements a `MathService` contract.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Define the MathService contract directly on the service class.  \n[ServiceContract]  \nclass MathService  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    public double Add(double A, double B) { return A + B; }  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    private double Multiply (double A, double B) { return A * B; }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n Note that the preceding services expose different contracts because the contract names are different. In the first case, the exposed contract is named \"`IMath`\" while in the second case the contract is named \"`MathService`\".  \n  \n You can set a few things at the service and operation implementation levels, such as concurrency and instancing. For more information, see [Designing and Implementing Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-and-implementing-services.md).  \n  \n After implementing a service contract, you must create one or more endpoints for the service. For more information, see [Endpoint Creation Overview](../../../docs/framework/wcf/endpoint-creation-overview.md). For more information about how to run a service, see [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Designing and Implementing
