The binding is set up to use a validation rule named `AgeRangeRule` so that if the user enters non-numeric characters or a value that is smaller than 21 or greater than 130, a red exclamation mark appears next to the text box and a tool tip with the error message appears when the user moves the mouse over the text box.  \n  \n [!code-xml[BindValidation#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BindValidation/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  \n  \n The following example shows the implementation of `AgeRangeRule`, which inherits from <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ValidationRule> and overrides the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ValidationRule.Validate%2A> method. The Int32.Parse() method is called on the value to make sure that it does not contain any invalid characters. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ValidationRule.Validate%2A> method returns a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ValidationResult> that indicates if the value is valid based on whether an exception is caught during the parsing and whether the age value is outside of the lower and upper bounds.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[BindValidation#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BindValidation/CSharp/AgeRangeRule.cs#3)]  \n  \n The following example shows the custom <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ControlTemplate> `validationTemplate` that creates a red exclamation mark to notify the user of a validation error. Control templates are used to redefine the appearance of a control.  \n  \n [!code-xml[BindValidation#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BindValidation/CSharp/Window1.xaml#4)]  \n  \n As shown in the following example, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTip> that shows the error message is created using the style named `textBoxInError`. If the value of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Validation.HasError%2A> is `true`, the trigger sets the tool tip of the current <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox> to its first validation error. The <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.RelativeSource%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Data.RelativeSourceMode>, referring to the current element.  \n  \n [!code-xml[BindValidation#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/BindValidation/CSharp/Window1.xaml#5)]  \n  \n For the complete example, see [Binding Validation Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=159972).  \n  \n Note that if you do not provide a custom <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Validation.ErrorTemplate%2A> the default error template appears to provide visual feedback to the user when there is a validation error. See \"Data Validation\" in [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md) for more information. Also, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] provides a built-in validation rule that catches exceptions that are thrown during the update of the binding source property. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ExceptionValidationRule>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Data Binding Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-binding-overview.md)   \n
