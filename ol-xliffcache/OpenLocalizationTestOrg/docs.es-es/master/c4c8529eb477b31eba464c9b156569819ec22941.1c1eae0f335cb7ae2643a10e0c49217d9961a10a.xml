Basic WCF Programming\nThis section presents the fundamentals for creating Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Basic Programming Lifecycle](../../../docs/framework/wcf/basic-programming-lifecycle.md)  \n Describes the lifecycle of designing, building, and deploying WCF service and client applications.  \n  \n [Designing and Implementing Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-and-implementing-services.md)  \n Describes how to design and implement a service contract, choose a message exchange pattern, specify a fault contract, and other basic aspects of services.  \n  \n [Configuring Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/configuring-services.md)  \n Describes how to configure a WCF service to support the contract requirements, customize local runtime behavior, and indicate the address to publish the service.  \n  \n [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md)  \n Describes the basics of hosting services in an application.  \n  \n [Building Clients](../../../docs/framework/wcf/building-clients.md)  \n Describes how to obtain metadata from services, convert that into WCF client code, handle security issues, and build, configure, and host a WCF client.  \n  \n [Introduction to Extensibility](../../../docs/framework/wcf/introduction-to-extensibility.md)  \n Describes how to extend WCF to create custom solutions.  \n  \n [WCF Troubleshooting Quickstart](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-troubleshooting-quickstart.md)  \n Describes some of the most common issues that occur, what you can do to solve them, and where to locate more information about the issue.  \n  \n [WCF and ASP.NET Web API](../../../docs/framework/wcf/wcf-and-aspnet-web-api.md)  \n Discusses the two technologies, how they relate to each other, and when to use them.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels>  \n  \n
