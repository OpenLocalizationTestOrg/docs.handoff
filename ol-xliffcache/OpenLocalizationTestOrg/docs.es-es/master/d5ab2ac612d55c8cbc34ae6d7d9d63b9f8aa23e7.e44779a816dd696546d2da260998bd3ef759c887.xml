The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> attached property of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is defined on the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>.  \n  \n The example manipulates the property value by using two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements; each element represents one of the Boolean property values. When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> property value is set to `true`, each column or row member of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DefinitionBase.SharedSizeGroup%2A> shares sizing information, regardless of the content of a row or column.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml#1)]  \n  \n ...  \n  \n [!code-xaml[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml#2)]  \n  \n The following code-behind example handles the methods that the button <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event raises. The example writes the results of these method calls to <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> elements that use related get methods to output the new property values as strings.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#3](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[gridIssharedsizescopeProp#3](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gridIssharedsizescopeProp/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#3)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A>\n- [Panels Overview](panels-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,337],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Grid control [WPF], sharing sizing data of columns\"\n  - \"sizing data in Grid controls [WPF]\"\n  - \"Grid control [WPF], sharing sizing data of rows\"\nms.assetid: a0535a6f-ff04-4b25-9912-7dd856e11044","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[344,389],"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","linkify":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Share Sizing Properties Between Grids","pos":[0,45]}]},{"pos":[390,546],"content":"This example shows how to share the sizing data of columns and rows between <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> elements in order to keep sizing consistent.","source":"This example shows how to share the sizing data of columns and rows between <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements in order to keep sizing consistent."},{"pos":[555,562],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example introduces two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> elements as child elements of a parent <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[566,719],"source":"The following example introduces two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> elements as child elements of a parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A&gt;</ph> attached property of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid&gt;</ph> is defined on the parent <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel&gt;</ph>.","pos":[720,904],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.IsSharedSizeScope%2A> attached property of <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> is defined on the parent <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>."},{"content":"The example manipulates the property value by using two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> elements;
