In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-implement-a-discovery-proxy.md), you implemented a discovery proxy. In this topic, you create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that sends announcement messages (`Hello` and `Bye`) to the discovery proxy, causing it to register and unregister itself with the discovery proxy.  \n  \n### To define the service contract  \n  \n1.  Add a new console application project to the `DiscoveryProxyExample` solution called `Service`.  \n  \n2.  Add references to the following assemblies:  \n  \n    1.  System.ServiceModel  \n  \n    2.  System.ServiceModel.Discovery  \n  \n3.  Add a new class to the project called `CalculatorService`.  \n  \n4.  Add the following using statements.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    using System;  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Within CalculatorService.cs, define the service contract.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Define a service contract.  \n        [ServiceContract(Namespace = \"http://Microsoft.Samples.Discovery\")]  \n        public interface ICalculatorService  \n        {  \n            [OperationContract]  \n            double Add(double n1, double n2);  \n            [OperationContract]  \n            double Subtract(double n1, double n2);  \n            [OperationContract]  \n            double Multiply(double n1, double n2);  \n            [OperationContract]  \n            double Divide(double n1, double n2);  \n        }  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Also within CalculatorService.cs, implement the service contract.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Service class which implements the service contract.      \n        public class CalculatorService : ICalculatorService  \n        {  \n            public double Add(double n1, double n2)  \n            {  \n                double result = n1 + n2;  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Received Add({0},{1})\", n1, n2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Return: {0}\", result);  \n                return result;  \n            }  \n  \n            public double Subtract(double n1, double n2)  \n            {  \n                double result = n1 - n2;  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Received Subtract({0},{1})\", n1, n2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Return: {0}\", result);  \n                return result;  \n            }  \n  \n            public double Multiply(double n1, double n2)  \n            {  \n                double result = n1 * n2;  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Received Multiply({0},{1})\", n1, n2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Return: {0}\", result);  \n                return result;  \n            }  \n  \n            public double Divide(double n1, double n2)  \n            {  \n                double result = n1 / n2;  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Received Divide({0},{1})\", n1, n2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Return: {0}\", result);  \n                return result;  \n            }  \n        }  \n    ```  \n  \n### To host the service  \n  \n1.  Open the Program.cs file that was generated when you created the project.  \n  \n2.  Add the following using statements.  \n  \n    ```csharp \n    using System;  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    using System.ServiceModel.Description;  \n    using System.ServiceModel.Discovery;  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Within the `Main()` method, add the following code:  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    // Define the base address of the service  \n    Uri baseAddress = new Uri(\"net.tcp://localhost:9002/CalculatorService/\" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString());  \n    // Define the endpoint address where announcement messages will be sent  \n    Uri announcementEndpointAddress = new Uri(\"net.tcp://localhost:9021/Announcement\");  \n  \n    // Create the service host  \n    ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(CalculatorService), baseAddress);  \n    try  \n    {  \n       // Add a service endpoint  \n       ServiceEndpoint netTcpEndpoint = serviceHost.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(ICalculatorService), new NetTcpBinding(), string.Empty);                \n  \n       // Create an announcement endpoint, which points to the Announcement Endpoint hosted by the proxy service.  \n       AnnouncementEndpoint announcementEndpoint = new AnnouncementEndpoint(new NetTcpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(announcementEndpointAddress));  \n  \n       // Create a ServiceDiscoveryBehavior and add the announcement endpoint  \n       ServiceDiscoveryBehavior serviceDiscoveryBehavior = new ServiceDiscoveryBehavior();  \n                    serviceDiscoveryBehavior.AnnouncementEndpoints.Add(announcementEndpoint);  \n  \n       // Add the ServiceDiscoveryBehavior to the service host to make the service discoverable  \n       serviceHost.Description.Behaviors.Add(serviceDiscoveryBehavior);  \n  \n       // Start listening for messages  \n      serviceHost.Open();  \n  \n       Console.WriteLine(\"Calculator Service started at {0}\", baseAddress);  \n       Console.WriteLine();  \n       Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate the service.\");  \n       Console.WriteLine();  \n       Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n       serviceHost.Close();  \n    }  \n    catch (CommunicationException e)  \n    {  \n       Console.WriteLine(e.Message);  \n    }  \n    catch (TimeoutException e)  \n    {  \n       Console.WriteLine(e.Message);  \n    }     \n  \n    if (serviceHost.State != CommunicationState.Closed)  \n    {  \n       Console.WriteLine(\"Aborting the service...\");  \n       serviceHost.Abort();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n You have completed implementing a discoverable service.
