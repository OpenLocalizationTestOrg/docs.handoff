Activation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/windows-process-activation.md)  \n Demonstrates service activation through network protocols.  \n  \n [Configuration-Based Activation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/configuration-based-activation.md)  \n Demonstrates activation of [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services without requiring a .svc file.  \n  \n [SystemWebRouting Integration Sample](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/systemwebrouting-integration-sample.md)  \n Demonstrates the hosting layer’s integration with the classes in the <xref:System.Web.Routing> namespace.  \n  \n [ASP.NET Compatibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/aspnet-compatibility.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] Compatibility mode in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [IIS Hosting Using Inline Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/iis-hosting-using-inline-code.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a service hosted by Internet Information Services (IIS), where the service code is contained in-line in a .svc file and is compiled on demand.  \n  \n [Windows Service Host](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/windows-service-host.md)  \n Demonstrates a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service hosted in a managed Windows Service.  \n  \n [Self-Host](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/self-host.md)  \n Demonstrates how to implement a self-hosted service in a console application.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,37],"content":"Hosting1 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Hosting1 | Microsoft
