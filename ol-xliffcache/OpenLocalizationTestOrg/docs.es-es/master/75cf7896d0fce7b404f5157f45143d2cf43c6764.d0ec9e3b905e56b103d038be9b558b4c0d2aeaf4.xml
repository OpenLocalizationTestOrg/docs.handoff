A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed. A figure can contain several primitives.  \n  \n You can draw a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)  \n Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> to create figures.  \n  \n [How to: Fill Open Figures](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-fill-open-figures.md)  \n Explains how to fill a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  \n  \n [How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)  \n Shows how to flatten a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,59],"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[567,597],"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","linkify":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","nodes":[{"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves, text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit.","pos":[598,741]},{"content":"A path can be divided into <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>figures<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> that are either open or closed.","pos":[742,810],"source":" A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed."},{"content":"A figure can contain several primitives.","pos":[811,851]},{"content":"You can draw a path by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[858,1121],"source":"You can draw a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"pos":[1130,1145],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)</ept>","pos":[1149,1304],"source":"[How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)"},{"content":"Shows how to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> to create figures.","pos":[1308,1390],"source":" Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> to create figures."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Fill Open Figures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-fill-open-figures.md)</ept>","pos":[1397,1498],"source":"[How to: Fill Open Figures](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-fill-open-figures.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to fill a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1502,1570],"source":" Explains how to fill a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)</ept>","pos":[1577,1710],"source":"[How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)"},{"content":"Shows how to flatten a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1714,1782],"source":" Shows how to flatten a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>."},{"pos":[1791,1800],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","pos":[1852,1914]}]}
