That is, it can be called from any callback except those that occur between [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionStarted](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionstarted-method.md) and [ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback2-garbagecollectionfinished-method.md).  \n  \n Most shifting of generations takes place during garbage collections. Generations might grow between collections but generally do not move around. Therefore, the most interesting places to call `GetGenerationBounds` are in `ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionStarted` and `ICorProfilerCallback2::GarbageCollectionFinished`.  \n  \n During program startup, some objects are allocated by the common language runtime (CLR) itself, generally in generations 3 and 0. Thus, by the time managed code starts executing, these generations will already contain objects. Generations 1 and 2 will normally be empty, except for dummy objects that are generated by the garbage collector. (The size of dummy objects is 12 bytes in 32-bit implementations of the CLR; the size is larger in 64-bit implementations.) You might also see generation 2 ranges that are inside modules produced by the Native Image Generator (NGen.exe). In this case, the objects in generation 2 are *frozen objects*, which are allocated when NGen.exe runs rather than by the garbage collector.  \n  \n This function uses caller-allocated buffers.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorProf.idl, CorProf.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ICorProfilerInfo Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo-interface.md)   \n [ICorProfilerInfo2 Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilerinfo2-interface.md)   \n [Profiling Interfaces](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/profiling-interfaces.md)   \n [Profiling](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,748],"nodes":[{"content":"ICorProfilerInfo2::GetGenerationBounds Method | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"ICorProfilerInfo2::GetGenerationBounds Method | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"ICorProfilerInfo2::GetGenerationBounds Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]}],"pos":[6,71],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"ICorProfilerInfo2::GetGenerationBounds Method | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
