A search for all matching elements is then performed with the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.FindAll%2A> method that incorporates a series of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AndCondition> boolean operations to limit the number of matching elements.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When searching from the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.RootElement%2A>, you should try to obtain only direct children. A search for descendants might iterate through hundreds or even thousands of elements, possibly resulting in a stack overflow. If you are attempting to obtain a specific element at a lower level, you should start your search from the application window or from a container at a lower level.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[InvokePatternApp#1100](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InvokePatternApp/CSharp/InvokePatternApp.cs#1100)]\n [!code-vb[InvokePatternApp#1100](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/InvokePatternApp/VisualBasic/Client.vb#1100)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [InvokePattern and ExpandCollapsePattern Menu Item Sample](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms771636(v=vs.90))\n- [Obtaining UI Automation Elements](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/obtaining-ui-automation-elements.md)\n- [Use the AutomationID Property](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/use-the-automationid-property.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,306],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"elements, finding by property conditions\"\n  - \"UI Automation, finding elements by property conditions\"\nms.assetid: 3acaee5a-6ce8-4c3e-81c8-67e59eb74477","nodes":[{"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","nodes":[{"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[313,371],"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","linkify":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","nodes":[{"content":"Find a UI Automation Element Based on a Property Condition","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[374,837],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This documentation is intended for .NET Framework developers who want to use the managed [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] classes defined in the <xref:System.Windows.Automation> namespace.
