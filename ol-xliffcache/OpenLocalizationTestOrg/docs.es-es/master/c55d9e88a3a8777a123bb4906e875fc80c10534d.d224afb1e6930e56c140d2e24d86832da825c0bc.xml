Your applications can monitor the power status of a computer and take action when a status change occurs. For example, if your application is running on a portable computer, you might want to disable certain features in your application when the computer's battery charge falls under a certain level.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] provides a <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.PowerModeChanged> event that occurs whenever there is a change in power status, such as when a user suspends or resumes the operating system, or when the AC power status or battery status changes. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.PowerStatus%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class can be used to query for the current status, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PowerMode#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/powermode/cs/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[PowerMode#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/powermode/vb/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n Besides the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BatteryChargeStatus> enumerations, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.PowerStatus%2A> property also contains enumerations for determining battery capacity (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.PowerStatus.BatteryFullLifetime%2A>) and battery charge percentage (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.PowerStatus.BatteryLifePercent%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PowerStatus.BatteryLifeRemaining%2A>).  \n  \n You can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application.SetSuspendState%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application> to put a computer into hibernation or suspend mode. If the `force` argument is set to `false`, the operating system will broadcast an event to all applications requesting permission to suspend. If the `disableWakeEvent` argument is set to `true`, the operating system disables all wake events.  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates how to put a computer into hibernation.  \n  \n
