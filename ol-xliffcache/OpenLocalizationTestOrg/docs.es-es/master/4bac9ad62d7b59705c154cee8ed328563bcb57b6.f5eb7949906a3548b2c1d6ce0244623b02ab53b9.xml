This topic provides a script written in HTML and JavaScript that administrators can use to determine whether the WPF plug-in for Firefox is installed.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For more information about installing, deploying, and detecting the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n When the [!INCLUDE[net_v35_short](../../../../includes/net-v35-short-md.md)] is installed, the client computer is configured with a WPF plug-in for Firefox. The following example script checks for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and then displays an appropriate status message.  \n  \n```  \n<HTML>  \n  \n  <HEAD>  \n    <TITLE>Test for the WPF plug-in for Firefox</TITLE>  \n    <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\" />  \n    <SCRIPT type=\"text/javascript\">  \n    <!--  \n    function OnLoad()  \n    {  \n  \n       // Check for the WPF plug-in for Firefox and report  \n       var msg = \"The WPF plug-in for Firefox is \";  \n       var wpfPlugin = navigator.plugins[\"Windows Presentation Foundation\"];  \n       if( wpfPlugin != null ) {  \n          document.writeln(msg + \" installed.\");  \n       }  \n       else {  \n          document.writeln(msg + \" not installed.
