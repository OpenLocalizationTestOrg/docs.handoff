This situation arises especially at design time, when data may not be available, but your data-bound controls still need to display information from a type's public interface. For example, you may bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to an object exposed by a Web service and want the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to label its columns at design time with the member names of a custom type.  \n  \n You can easily bind a control to a type with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to bind a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control to a custom type by using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. When you run the example, you'll notice the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> has labeled columns that reflect the properties of a `Customer` object, before the control is populated with data. The example has an Add Customer button to add data to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. When you click the button, a new `Customer` object is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>. In a real-world scenario, the data might be obtained by a call to a Web service or other data source.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindingToType#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindingToType/CS/form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindingToType#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnector.BindingToType/VB/form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
