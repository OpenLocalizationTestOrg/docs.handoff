A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed. A figure can contain several primitives.  \n  \n You can draw a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)  \n Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> to create figures.  \n  \n [How to: Fill Open Figures](how-to-fill-open-figures.md)  \n Explains how to fill a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  \n  \n [How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line](how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)  \n Shows how to flatten a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,348],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Constructing and Drawing Paths\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"paths [Windows Forms], drawing\"\n  - \"drawing paths [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"graphics paths [Windows Forms], creating\"\n  - \"graphics paths [Windows Forms], drawing\"\n  - \"examples [Windows Forms], drawing paths\"\nms.assetid: f16ec921-56cf-46d1-9741-d7316ad06b23","nodes":[{"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","nodes":[{"pos":[0,30],"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","nodes":[{"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","pos":[0,30]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[355,385],"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","linkify":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","nodes":[{"content":"Constructing and Drawing Paths","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves, text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit.","pos":[386,529]},{"content":"A path can be divided into <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>figures<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> that are either open or closed.","pos":[530,598],"source":" A path can be divided into *figures* that are either open or closed."},{"content":"A figure can contain several primitives.","pos":[599,639]},{"pos":[646,909],"content":"You can draw a path by calling the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","source":"You can draw a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.FillPath%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"pos":[918,933],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)</ept>","pos":[937,1047],"source":"[How to: Create Figures from Lines, Curves, and Shapes](how-to-create-figures-from-lines-curves-and-shapes.md)"},{"content":"Shows how to use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph> to create figures.","pos":[1051,1133],"source":"Shows how to use a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath> to create figures."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Fill Open Figures<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-fill-open-figures.md)</ept>","pos":[1140,1196],"source":"[How to: Fill Open Figures](how-to-fill-open-figures.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to fill a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1200,1268],"source":"Explains how to fill a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)</ept>","pos":[1275,1363],"source":"[How to: Flatten a Curved Path into a Line](how-to-flatten-a-curved-path-into-a-line.md)"},{"content":"Shows how to flatten a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1367,1435],"source":"Shows how to flatten a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.GraphicsPath>."},{"pos":[1444,1453],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.","pos":[1505,1567]}]}
