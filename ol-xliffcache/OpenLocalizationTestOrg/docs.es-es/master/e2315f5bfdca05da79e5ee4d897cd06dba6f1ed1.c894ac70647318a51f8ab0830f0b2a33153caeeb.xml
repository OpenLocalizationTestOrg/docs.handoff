They also contain methods for opening, closing, moving, and deleting files and folders. You can create instances of these classes by passing a string that represents the name of the file, folder, or drive in to the constructor:  \n  \n```csharp  \nSystem.IO.DriveInfo di = new System.IO.DriveInfo(@\"C:\\\");  \n```  \n  \n You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows various ways to access information about files and folders.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csFilesandFolders#6](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csFilesAndFolders/CS/FileIteration.cs#6)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n When you process user-specified path strings, you should also handle exceptions for the following conditions:  \n  \n-   The file name is malformed. For example, it contains invalid characters or only white space.  \n  \n-   The file name is null.  \n  \n-   The file name is longer than the system-defined maximum length.  \n  \n-   The file name contains a colon (:).  \n  \n If the application does not have sufficient permissions to read the specified file, the `Exists` method returns `false` regardless of whether a path exists; the method does not throw an exception.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,248],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  - C# Programming Guide\"\nms.custom: seodec18\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"files [C#], getting information about\"\nms.assetid: 22fc2da6-5494-405b-995e-c0b99142a93e","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"pos":[0,80],"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  - C# Programming Guide","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  - C# Programming Guide","pos":[0,80]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[255,335],"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,80]}]},{"content":"In the .NET Framework, you can access file system information by using the following classes:","pos":[336,429]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.FileInfo&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo&gt;</ph> classes represent a file or directory and contain properties that expose many of the file attributes that are supported by the NTFS file system.","pos":[759,968],"source":"The <xref:System.IO.FileInfo> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo> classes represent a file or directory and contain properties that expose many of the file attributes that are supported by the NTFS file system."},{"content":"They also contain methods for opening, closing, moving, and deleting files and folders.","pos":[969,1056]},{"content":"You can create instances of these classes by passing a string that represents the name of the file, folder, or drive in to the constructor:","pos":[1057,1196]},{"pos":[1284,1590],"content":"You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph>.","source":"You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>."},{"pos":[1597,1798],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files.","source":"The <xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files."},{"pos":[1807,1814],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows various ways to access information about files and folders.","pos":[1818,1905]},{"pos":[2044,2062],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"When you process user-specified path strings, you should also handle exceptions for the following conditions:","pos":[2066,2175]},{"content":"The file name is malformed.","pos":[2185,2212]},{"content":"For example, it contains invalid characters or only white space.","pos":[2213,2277]},{"content":"The file name is null.","pos":[2287,2309]},{"content":"The file name is longer than the system-defined maximum length.","pos":[2319,2382]},{"content":"The file name contains a colon (:).","pos":[2392,2427]},{"pos":[2434,2630],"content":"If the application does not have sufficient permissions to read the specified file, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Exists`</ph> method returns <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph> regardless of whether a path exists;
