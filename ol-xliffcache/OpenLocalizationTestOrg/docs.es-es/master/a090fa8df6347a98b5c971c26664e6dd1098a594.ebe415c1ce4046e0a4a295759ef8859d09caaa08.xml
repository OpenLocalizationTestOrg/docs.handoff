This method cannot be used to move a file; use the `MoveFile` method to move and rename the file.  \n  \n### To rename a file  \n  \n-   Use the `My.Computer.FileSystem.RenameFile` method to rename a file. This example renames the file named `Test.txt` to `SecondTest.txt`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#9](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-rename-a-file_1.vb)]  \n  \n This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, the snippet is located in **File system - Processing Drives, Folders, and Files**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\\\\\.\\\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   `newName` contains path information (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   `newName` is `Nothing` or an empty string (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The source file is not valid or does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  \n  \n-   There is an existing file or directory with the name specified in `newName` (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   A file or directory name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have the required permission (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.RenameFile%2A>   \n [How to: Move a
