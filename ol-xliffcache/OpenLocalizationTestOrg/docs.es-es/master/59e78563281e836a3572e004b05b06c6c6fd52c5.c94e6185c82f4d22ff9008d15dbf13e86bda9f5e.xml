A thread in the thread pool performs the wait operation.  \n  \n Using the <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class is straightforward. You create a **Timer**, passing a <xref:System.Threading.TimerCallback> delegate to the callback method, an object representing state that will be passed to the callback, an initial raise time, and a time representing the period between callback invocations. To cancel a pending timer, call the **Timer.Dispose** function.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  There are two other timer classes. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class is a control that works with visual designers and is meant to be used in user interface contexts; it raises events on the user interface thread. The <xref:System.Timers.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class derives from <xref:System.ComponentModel.Component>, so it can be used with visual designers; it also raises events, but it raises them on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread. The <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class makes callbacks on a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool> thread and does not use the event model at all. It also provides a state object to the callback method, which the other timers do not. It is extremely lightweight.  \n  \n The following code example starts a timer that starts after one second (1000 milliseconds) and ticks every second until you press the **Enter** key. The variable containing the reference to the timer is a class-level field, to ensure that the timer is not subject to garbage collection while it is still running. For more information on aggressive garbage collection, see <xref:System.GC.KeepAlive%2A>.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[System.Threading.Timer#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Threading.Timer/CPP/source2.cpp#2)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Threading.Timer#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Threading.Timer/CS/source2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.Threading.Timer#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.Threading.Timer/VB/source2.vb#2)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Threading.Timer>   \n [Threading Objects and Features](../../../docs/standard/threading/threading-objects-and-features.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,35],"content":"Timers | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Timers | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,23]}]},{"pos":[417,423],"content":"Timers","linkify":"Timers","nodes":[{"content":"Timers","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"Timers are lightweight objects that enable you to specify a delegate to be called at a specified time.","pos":[424,526]},{"content":"A thread in the thread pool performs the wait operation.","pos":[527,583]},{"content":"Using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class is straightforward.","pos":[590,680],"source":"Using the <xref:System.Threading.Timer?displayProperty=fullName> class is straightforward."},{"content":"You create a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Timer<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, passing a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.TimerCallback&gt;</ph> delegate to the callback method, an object representing state that will be passed to the callback, an initial raise time, and a time representing the period between callback invocations.","pos":[681,939],"source":" You create a **Timer**, passing a <xref:System.Threading.TimerCallback> delegate to the callback method, an object representing state that will be passed to the callback, an initial raise time, and a time representing the period between callback invocations."},{"content":"To cancel a pending timer, call the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Timer.Dispose<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> function.","pos":[940,1003],"source":" To cancel a pending timer, call the **Timer.Dispose** function."},{"pos":[1011,1801],"content":"[!NOTE]\n There are two other timer classes.
