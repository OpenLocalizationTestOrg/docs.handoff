If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`. If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error. If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30668  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Examine the quoted error message and take appropriate action.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that the source code reference is spelling the member name correctly.","nodes":[{"pos":[4,205],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<membername>' is obsolete: '<errormessage>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30668\"\n  - \"vbc30668\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30668\"\nms.assetid: 25e5606c-2734-4f42-a2bc-1ad28ec1e892","nodes":[{"content":"'<membername>' is obsolete: '<errormessage>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;membername&gt;</ph>' is obsolete: '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;errormessage&gt;</ph>'","source":"'<membername>' is obsolete: '<errormessage>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[212,258],"content":"'\\<membername>' is obsolete: '\\<errormessage>'","linkify":"'\\<membername>' is obsolete: '\\<errormessage>'","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>membername&gt;' is obsolete: '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>errormessage&gt;'","pos":[0,46],"source":"'\\<membername>' is obsolete: '\\<errormessage>'"}]},{"pos":[259,433],"content":"A statement attempts to access a class or structure member which has been marked with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error.","source":"A statement attempts to access a class or structure member which has been marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error."},{"content":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> to it.","pos":[440,553],"source":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> to it."},{"content":"If you do this, you can set the attribute's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A&gt;</ph> property to either <ph id=\"ph2\">`True`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`False`</ph>.","pos":[554,678],"source":" If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`True`</ph>, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error.","pos":[679,766],"source":" If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`False`</ph>, or let it default to <ph id=\"ph2\">`False`</ph>, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.","pos":[767,895],"source":" If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element."},{"pos":[902,923],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30668","source":"**Error ID:** BC30668"},{"pos":[932,953],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Examine the quoted error message and take appropriate action.","pos":[963,1024]},{"content":"Ensure that the source code reference is spelling the member name correctly.","pos":[1034,1110]}]}
