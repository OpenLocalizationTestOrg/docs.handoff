Behavior](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/service-auditing-behavior.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceSecurityAuditBehavior> to enable auditing of security events during service operations.  \n  \n [Membership and Role Provider](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/membership-and-role-provider.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how a service can use the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] membership and role providers to authenticate and authorize clients.  \n  \n [Authorizing Access to Service Operations](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/authorizing-access-to-service-operations.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to use the [\\<serviceAuthorization>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/serviceauthorization-element.md) to enable use of the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.PrincipalPermissionAttribute> attribute to authorize access to service operations.  \n  \n [Impersonating the Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/impersonating-the-client.md)  \n This sample demonstrates how to impersonate the caller application at the service so that the service can access system resources on behalf of the caller.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,46],"content":"Behavior Security | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Behavior Security | Microsoft
