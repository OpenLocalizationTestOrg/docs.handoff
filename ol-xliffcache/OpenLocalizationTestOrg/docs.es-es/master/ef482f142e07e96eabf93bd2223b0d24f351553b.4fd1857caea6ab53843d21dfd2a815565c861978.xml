The option is off by default or if you specify `/highentropyva-`. The option is on if you specify `/highentropyva` or `/highentropyva+`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n If you specify this option, compatible versions of the Windows kernel can use higher degrees of entropy when the kernel randomizes the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR. If the kernel uses higher degrees of entropy, a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps. As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.  \n  \n When the option is on, the target executable and any modules on which it depends must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when those modules are running as 64-bit processes.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)   \n [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"/highentropyva (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"/highentropyva (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[622,651],"content":"/highentropyva (Visual Basic)","linkify":"/highentropyva (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"/highentropyva (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[652,894],"content":"Indicates whether a 64-bit executable or an executable that's marked by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/platform:anycpu<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/platform.md)</ept> compiler option supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).","source":"Indicates whether a 64-bit executable or an executable that's marked by the [/platform:anycpu](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/platform.md) compiler option supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)."},{"pos":[903,909],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[957,966],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> &amp;#124; <ph id=\"ph2\">`-`</ph>","pos":[970,984],"source":"`+` &#124; `-`"},{"content":"Optional.","pos":[988,997]},{"content":"The option is off by default or if you specify <ph id=\"ph1\">`/highentropyva-`</ph>.","pos":[998,1063],"source":" The option is off by default or if you specify `/highentropyva-`."},{"content":"The option is on if you specify <ph id=\"ph1\">`/highentropyva`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`/highentropyva+`</ph>.","pos":[1064,1134],"source":" The option is on if you specify `/highentropyva` or `/highentropyva+`."},{"pos":[1143,1150],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"If you specify this option, compatible versions of the Windows kernel can use higher degrees of entropy when the kernel randomizes the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR.","pos":[1154,1339]},{"content":"If the kernel uses higher degrees of entropy, a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps.","pos":[1340,1475]},{"content":"As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.","pos":[1476,1562]},{"content":"When the option is on, the target executable and any modules on which it depends must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when those modules are running as 64-bit processes.","pos":[1569,1777]},{"pos":[1786,1794],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1798,1899],"source":"[Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Sample Compilation Command Lines<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)</ept>","pos":[1902,2028],"source":" [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)"}]}
