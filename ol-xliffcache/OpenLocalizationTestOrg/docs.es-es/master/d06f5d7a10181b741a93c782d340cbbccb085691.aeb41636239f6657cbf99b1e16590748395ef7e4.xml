The specified methods in the specified type violate this rule. Change the name of one of the operations by changing the method name or by using the Name property of OperationContractAttribute.|  \n|CannotInheritTwoOperationsWithTheSameName3|Cannot inherit two different operations with the same name. The specified operation from the specified contracts violate this rule. Change the name of one of the operations by changing the method name or by using the Name property of OperationContractAttribute.|  \n|CantCreateChannelWithManualAddressing|Cannot create a channel for a contract that requires a request/reply and a binding that requires manual addressing but only supports duplex communication.|  \n|DuplicateBehavior1|The value cannot be added to the collection. The collection already contains an item of the same specified type. This collection only supports one instance of each type.|  \n|InAContractInheritanceHierarchyIfParentHasCallbackChildMustToo|Because the specified base service contract has a specified callback contract, the specified derived service contract must also specify either the specified type, or a derived type as its callback contract.|  \n|InvalidAsyncBeginMethodSignatureForMethod2|Invalid asynchronous Begin method signature for the specified method in the specified ServiceContract type. Your begin method must take an AsyncCallback and an object as the last two arguments and return an IAsyncResult.|  \n|InvalidAsyncEndMethodSignatureForMethod2|Invalid asynchronous End method signature for the specified method in the specified ServiceContract type. Your end method must take an IAsyncResult as the last argument.|  \n|MessagePropertiesArraySize0|The array that was passed does not have enough space to hold all the properties contained by this collection.|  \n|OneWayAndFaultsIncompatible2|The specified method in the specified type is marked as IsOneWay=true and declares one or more FaultContractAttributes. One-way methods cannot declare FaultContractAttributes. Change IsOneWay to false or remove the FaultContractAttributes.|  \n|UnsupportedWSDLOnlyOneMessage|Unsupported Web Services Description Language. Only one message part is supported for fault messages. This fault message refers to more than one message part. If you have edit access to the Web Services Description Language file, you can fix the problem by removing the extra message parts such that fault message references just one part.|  \n|UnsupportedWSDLTheFault|Unsupported Web Services Description Language. The fault message part must reference an element. This fault message does not refer to an element. If you have edit access to the Web Services Definition Language document, you can fix the problem by referencing a schema element using the 'element' attribute.|  \n|WsdlImportErrorDependencyDetail|An error occurred while importing the specified that the other specified value is dependent on. The Xpath is also specified.|  \n|XsdMissingRequiredAttribute1|Missing the specified required attribute.|","nodes":[{"pos":[12,55],"content":"Service Framework Metadata | Microsoft
