You can easily align text drawn with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods by creating the correct formatting object and setting the appropriate format flags.  \n  \n### To draw centered text with GDI+ (DrawString)  \n  \n1.
