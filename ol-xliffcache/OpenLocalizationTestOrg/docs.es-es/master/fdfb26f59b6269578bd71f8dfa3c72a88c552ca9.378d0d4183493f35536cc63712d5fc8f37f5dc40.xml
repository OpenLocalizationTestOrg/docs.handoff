The figure consists of a single arc. The arc has a sweep angle of –180 degrees, which is counterclockwise in the default coordinate system.  \n  \n-   The second example creates a path that has two figures. The first figure is an arc followed by a line. The second figure is a line followed by a curve followed by a line. The first figure is left open, and the second figure is closed.  \n  \n
