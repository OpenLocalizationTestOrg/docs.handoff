When you develop or deploy your app, you might need to know which .NET Framework versions are installed on the userâ€™s computer. Note that the .NET Framework consists of two main components, which are versioned separately:  \n  \n-   A set of assemblies, which are collections of types and resources that provide the functionality for your apps. The .NET Framework and assemblies share the same version number.  \n  \n-   The common language runtime (CLR), which manages and executes your app's code. The CLR is identified by its own version number (see [Versions and Dependencies](~/docs/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies.md)).  \n  \n To get an accurate list of the .NET Framework versions installed on a computer, you can view the registry or query the registry in code:  \n  \n [Viewing the registry (versions 1-4)](#net_a)  \n [Viewing the registry (version 4.5 and later)](#net_b)  \n [Using code to query the registry (versions 1-4)](#net_c)  \n [Using code to query the registry (version 4.5 and later)](#net_d)  \n  \n To find the CLR version, you can use a tool or code:  \n  \n [Using the Clrver tool](#clr_a)  \n [Using code to query the System.Environment class](#clr_b)  \n  \n For information about detecting the installed updates for each version of the .NET Framework, see [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Updates Are Installed](~/docs/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-net-framework-updates-are-installed.md). For information about installing the .NET Framework, see [Install the .NET Framework for developers](../../../docs/framework/install/guide-for-developers.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"net_a\"></a>   \n#### To find .NET Framework versions by viewing the registry (.NET Framework 1-4)  \n  \n1.  On the **Start** menu, choose **Run**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Open** box, enter **regedit.exe**.  \n  \n     You must have administrative credentials to run regedit.exe.  \n  \n3.  In the Registry Editor, open the following subkey:  \n  \n     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP`  \n  \n     The installed versions are listed under the NDP subkey. The version number is stored in the **Version** entry. For the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_long](../../../includes/net-v40-long-md.md)] the **Version** entry is under the Client or Full subkey (under NDP), or under both subkeys.  \n  \n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > The \"NET Framework Setup\" folder in the registry does not begin with a period.\n\n<a name=\"net_b\"></a> \n#### To find .NET Framework versions by viewing the registry (.NET Framework 4.5 and later)\n\n1. On the **Start** menu, choose **Run**.\n\n2. In the **Open** box, enter **regedit.exe**.\n\n     You must have administrative credentials to run regedit.exe.\n\n3. In the Registry Editor, open the following subkey:\n\n     `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4\\Full`\n\n     Note that the path to the `Full` subkey includes the subkey `Net Framework` rather than `.NET Framework`.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > If the `Full` subkey is not present, then you do not have the .NET Framework 4.5 or later installed.\n\n     Check for a DWORD value named `Release`. The existence of the `Release` DWORD indicates that the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or newer has been installed on that computer.\n\n     ![The registry entry for the .NET Framework 4.5.](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/media/clr-installdir.png \"CLR_InstallDir\")\n\n     The value of the `Release` DWORD indicates which version of the .NET Framework is installed.\n\n    |Value of the Release DWORD|Version|\n    |--------------------------------|-------------|\n    |378389|.NET Framework 4.5|\n    |378675|.NET Framework 4.5.1 installed with Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2|\n    |378758|.NET Framework 4.5.1 installed on Windows 8, Windows 7 SP1, or Windows Vista SP2|\n    |379893|.NET Framework 4.5.2|\n    |On Windows 10 systems: 393295<br /><br /> On all other OS versions: 393297|[!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)]|\n    |On Windows 10 November Update systems: 394254<br /><br /> On all other OS versions: 394271|[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)]|\n    |On Windows 10 Anniversary Update: 394802<br /><br /> On all other OS versions: 394806|[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)]| \n    |On Windows 10 Creators Update: 460798<br/><br/> On all other OS versions: 460805 | .NET Framework 4.7 |\n\n<a name=\"net_c\"></a> \n#### To find .NET Framework versions by querying the registry in code (.NET Framework 1-4)\n\n- Use the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey?displayProperty=fullName> class to access the Software\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\ subkey under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the Windows registry.\n\n     The following code shows an example of this query.\n\n    > [!NOTE]\n    > This code does not show how to detect the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or later. Check the `Release` DWORD to detect those versions, as described in the previous section. For code that does detect the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or later versions, see the next section in this article.\n\n     [!code-csharp[ListVersions](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed1.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[ListVersions](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed1.vb)]\n\n     The example produces output that's similar to the following:\n\n    ```\n    v2.0.50727  2.0.50727.4016  SP2\n    v3.0  3.0.30729.4037  SP2\n    v3.5  3.5.30729.01  SP1\n    v4\n      Client  4.0.30319\n      Full  4.0.30319\n    ```\n\n<a name=\"net_d\"></a> \n#### To find .NET Framework versions by querying the registry in code (.NET Framework 4.5 and later)\n\n1. The existence of the `Release` DWORD indicates that the .NET Framework 4.5 or later has been installed on a computer. The value of the keyword indicates the installed version. To check this keyword, use the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey%2A> and <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey.OpenSubKey%2A> methods of the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey?displayProperty=fullName> class to access the Software\\Microsoft\\NET Framework Setup\\NDP\\v4\\Full subkey under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the Windows registry.\n\n2. Check the value of the `Release` keyword to determine the installed version. To be forward-compatible, you can check for a value greater than or equal to the values listed in the table. Here are the .NET Framework versions and associated `Release` keywords.\n\n    |Version|Value of the Release DWORD|\n    |-------------|--------------------------------|\n    |.NET Framework 4.5|378389|\n    |.NET Framework 4.5.1 installed with Windows 8.1|378675|\n    |.NET Framework 4.5.1 installed on Windows 8, Windows 7 SP1, or Windows Vista SP2|378758|\n    |.NET Framework 4.5.2|379893|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] installed with Windows 10|393295|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v46](../../../includes/net-v46-md.md)] installed on all other Windows OS versions|393297|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] installed on Windows 10|394254|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] installed on all other Windows OS versions|394271|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] installed on Windows 10 Anniversary Update|394802|\n    |[!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] installed on all other Windows OS versions|394806|\n    |.NET Framework 4.7 installed on Windows 10 Creators Update|460798|\n    |.NET Framework 4.7 installed on all other Windows OS versions|460805|\n\n     The following example checks the `Release` value in the registry to determine whether the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] or a later version of the .NET Framework is installed.\n\n     [!code-csharp[ListVersions#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed3.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[ListVersions#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed3.vb)]\n\n     This example follows the recommended practice for version checking:\n\n    - It checks whether the value of the `Release` entry is *greater than or equal to* the value of the known release keys.\n\n    - It checks in order from most recent version to earliest version.\n\n<a name=\"clr_a\"></a> \n#### To find the current runtime version by using the Clrver tool\n\n- Use the CLR Version Tool (Clrver.exe) to determine which versions of the common language runtime are installed on a computer.\n\n     From a Visual Studio Command Prompt, enter `clrver`. This command produces output similar to the following:\n\n    ```\n    Versions installed on the machine:\n    v2.0.50727\n    v4.0.30319\n    ```\n\n     For more information about using this tool, see [Clrver.exe (CLR Version Tool)](~/docs/framework/tools/clrver-exe-clr-version-tool.md).\n\n<a name=\"clr_b\"></a> \n#### To find the current runtime version by querying the Environment class in code\n\n- Query the <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to retrieve a <xref:System.Version> object that identifies the version of the runtime that is currently executing the code. You can use the <xref:System.Version.Major%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to get the major release identifier (for example, \"4\" for version 4.0), the <xref:System.Version.Minor%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to get the minor release identifier (for example, \"0\" for version 4.0), or the <xref:System.Object.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to get the entire version string (for example, \"4.0.30319.18010\", as shown in the following code). This property returns a single value that reflects the version of the runtime that is currently executing the code; it does not return assembly versions or other versions of the runtime that may have been installed on the computer.\n\n     For the .NET Framework Versions 4, 4.5, 4.5.1, and 4.5.2, the <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns a <xref:System.Version> object whose string representation has the form `4.0.30319.xxxxx`. For the .NET Framework 4.6 and later, it has the form `4.0.30319.42000`.\n\n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    > For the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)] and later, we do not recommend using the  <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property to detect the version of the runtime. Instead, we recommend that you query the registry, as described in the [To find .NET Framework versions by querying the registry in code (.NET Framework 4.5 and later)](#net_d) section earlier in this article.\n\n     Here's an example of querying the <xref:System.Environment.Version%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property for runtime version information:\n\n     [!code-csharp[ListVersions](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed2.cs)]\n     [!code-vb[ListVersions](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/framework/migration-guide/versions-installed2.vb)]\n\n     The example produces output that's similar to the following:\n\n    ```\n    Version: 4.0.30319.18010\n    ```\n\n## See Also\n [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Updates Are
