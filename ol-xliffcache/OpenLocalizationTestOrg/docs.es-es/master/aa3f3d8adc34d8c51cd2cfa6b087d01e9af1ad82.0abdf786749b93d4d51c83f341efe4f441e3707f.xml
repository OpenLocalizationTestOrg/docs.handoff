A form is ultimately a blank slate that you, as a developer, enhance with controls to create a user interface and with code to manipulate data. To that end, Visual Studio provides you with an integrated development environment (IDE) to aid in writing code, as well as a rich control set written with the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. By complementing the functionality of these controls with your code, you can easily and quickly develop the solutions you need.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Getting Started with Windows Forms](getting-started-with-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides links to topics about how to harness the power of Windows Forms to display data, handle user input, and deploy your applications easily and with more robust security.  \n  \n [Enhancing Windows Forms Applications](./advanced/index.md)  \n Provides links to topics about how to enhance your Windows Forms with a variety of features.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Windows Forms Controls](./controls/index.md)  \n Contains links to topics that describe Windows Forms controls and show how to implement them.  \n  \n [Windows Forms Data Binding](windows-forms-data-binding.md)  \n Contains links to topics that describe the Windows Forms data-binding architecture.  \n  \n [Graphics Overview](./advanced/graphics-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Discusses how to create graphics, draw text, and manipulate graphical images as objects using the advanced implementation of the Windows graphics design interface.  \n  \n [ClickOnce Security and Deployment](/visualstudio/deployment/clickonce-security-and-deployment)  \n Discusses the principles of ClickOnce deployment.  \n  \n [Windows Forms/MFC Programming Differences](/cpp/dotnet/windows-forms-mfc-programming-differences)  \n Discusses the differences between MFC applications and Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Accessing data in
