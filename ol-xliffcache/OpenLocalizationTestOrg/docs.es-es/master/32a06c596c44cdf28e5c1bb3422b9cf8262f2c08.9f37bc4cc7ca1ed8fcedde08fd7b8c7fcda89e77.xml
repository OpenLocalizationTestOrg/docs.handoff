For example:  \n  \n```  \n@file1.rsp @file2.rsp  \n```  \n  \n In a response file, multiple compiler options and source code files can appear on one line. A single compiler option specification must appear on one line (cannot span multiple lines). Response files can have comments that begin with the # symbol.  \n  \n Specifying compiler options from within a response file is just like issuing those commands on the command line. See [Building from the Command Line](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md) for more information.  \n  \n The compiler processes the command options as they are encountered. Therefore, command line arguments can override previously listed options in response files. Conversely, options in a response file will override options listed previously on the command line or in other response files.  \n  \n C# provides the csc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the csc.exe file. See [-noconfig](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md) for more information on csc.rsp.  \n  \n This compiler option cannot be set in the Visual Studio development environment, nor can it be changed programmatically.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following are a few lines from a sample response file:  \n  \n```console  \n# build the first output file  \n-target:exe -out:MyExe.exe source1.cs source2.cs  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,227],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"@ (C# Compiler Options)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"@\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"response files, specifying for compilation [C#]\"\n  - \"@ compiler option\"\nms.assetid: dda4fa9f-a02c-400f-8b6a-d58834e13d7f","nodes":[{"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,23],"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,23]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[234,257],"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","linkify":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"The @ option lets you specify a file that contains compiler options and source code files to compile.","pos":[258,359]},{"pos":[368,374],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[415,424],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"A file that lists compiler options or source code files to compile.","pos":[447,514]},{"pos":[523,530],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The compiler options and source code files will be processed by the compiler just as if they had been specified on the command line.","pos":[534,666]},{"content":"To specify more than one response file in a compilation, specify multiple response file options.","pos":[673,769]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[770,782]},{"content":"In a response file, multiple compiler options and source code files can appear on one line.","pos":[828,919]},{"content":"A single compiler option specification must appear on one line (cannot span multiple lines).","pos":[920,1012]},{"content":"Response files can have comments that begin with the # symbol.","pos":[1013,1075]},{"content":"Specifying compiler options from within a response file is just like issuing those commands on the command line.","pos":[1082,1194]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md)</ept> for more information.","pos":[1195,1377],"source":" See [Building from the Command Line](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md) for more information."},{"content":"The compiler processes the command options as they are encountered.","pos":[1384,1451]},{"content":"Therefore, command line arguments can override previously listed options in response files.","pos":[1452,1543]},{"content":"Conversely, options in a response file will override options listed previously on the command line or in other response files.","pos":[1544,1670]},{"content":"C# provides the csc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the csc.exe file.","pos":[1677,1766]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>-noconfig<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md)</ept> for more information on csc.rsp.","pos":[1767,1896],"source":" See [-noconfig](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md) for more information on csc.rsp."},{"content":"This compiler option cannot be set in the Visual Studio development environment, nor can it be changed programmatically.","pos":[1903,2023]},{"pos":[2032,2039],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following are a few lines from a sample response file:","pos":[2043,2101]},{"pos":[2215,2223],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2227,2310],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Compiler Options<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)"}]}
