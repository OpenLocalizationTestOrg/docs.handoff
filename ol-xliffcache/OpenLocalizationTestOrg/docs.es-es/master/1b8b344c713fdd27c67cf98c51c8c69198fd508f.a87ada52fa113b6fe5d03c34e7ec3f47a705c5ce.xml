However, WSE 3.0 services do not support the metadata exchange (MEX) protocol, so when you use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to create a WCF client class, the security settings are not applied to the generated WCF client. Therefore, you must specify the security settings that the WSE 3.0 service requires after the WCF client is generated.  \n  \n You can apply these security settings by using a custom binding to take into account the WSE 3.0 service's requirements and the interoperable requirements between a WSE 3.0 service and a WCF client. These interoperability requirements include the aforementioned use of the August 2004 WS-Addressing specification and the  WSE 3.0default message protection of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt>. The default message protection for WCF is <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncryptAndEncryptSignature>. This topic details how to create a WCF binding that interoperates with a WSE 3.0 service. WCF also provides a sample that incorporates this binding. For more information about this sample, see [Interoperating with ASMX Web Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/interoperating-with-asmx-web-services.md).  \n  \n### To access a WSE 3.0 Web service with a WCF client  \n  \n1.  Run the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to create a WCF client for the WSE 3.0 Web service.  \n  \n     For a WSE 3.0 Web service, a WCF client is created. Because WSE 3.0 does not support the MEX protocol, you cannot use the tool to retrieve the security requirements for the Web service. The application developer must add the security settings for the client.  \n  \n     For more information about creating a WCF client, see the [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).  \n  \n2.  Create a class that represents a binding that can communicate with WSE 3.0 Web services.  \n  \n     The following class is part of the [Interoperating with WSE](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-3.5/ms752257%28v=vs.90%29) sample:  \n  \n    1.  Create a class that derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> class.  \n  \n         The following code example creates a class named `WseHttpBinding` that derives from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding> class.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#1)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#1)]  \n  \n    2.  Add properties to the class that specify the WSE turnkey assertion used by the WSE service, whether derived keys are required, whether secure sessions are used, whether signature confirmations are required, and the message protection settings. In WSE 3.0, a turnkey assertion specifies the security requirements for a client or Web serviceâ€”similar to the authentication mode of a binding in WCF.  \n  \n         The following code example defines the `SecurityAssertion`, `RequireDerivedKeys`, `EstablishSecurityContext`, and `MessageProtectionOrder` properties that specify the WSE turnkey assertion, whether derived keys are required, whether secure sessions are used, whether signature confirmations are required, and the message protection settings, respectively.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#3)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#3)]  \n  \n    3.  Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.Binding.CreateBindingElements%2A> method to set the binding properties.  \n  \n         The following code example specifies the transport, message encoding, and message protection settings by getting the values of the `SecurityAssertion` and `MessageProtectionOrder` properties.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/wsehttpbinding.cs#2)]\n         [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/wsehttpbinding.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  In the client application code, add code to set the binding properties.  \n  \n     The following code example specifies that the WCF client must use message protection and authentication as defined by the WSE 3.0 `AnonymousForCertificate` turnkey security assertion. Additionally, secure sessions and derived keys are required.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_WCFClientToWSEService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/cs/client.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[c_WCFClientToWSEService#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_wcfclienttowseservice/vb/client.vb#4)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example defines a custom binding that exposes properties that correspond to the properties of a WSE 3.0 turnkey security assertion. That custom binding, which is named `WseHttpBinding`, is then used to specify the binding properties for a WCF client that communicates with the WSSecurityAnonymous WSE 3.0 QuickStart sample.  \n\n##
