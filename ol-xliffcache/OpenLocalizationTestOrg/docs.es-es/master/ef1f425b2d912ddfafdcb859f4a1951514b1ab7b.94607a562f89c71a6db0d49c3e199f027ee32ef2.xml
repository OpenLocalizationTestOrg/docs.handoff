By writing code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event, you can specify what to print and how to print it.  \n  \n### To create a print job  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to your form.  \n  \n2.  Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  \n  \n     You will have to code your own printing logic. Additionally, you will have to specify the material to be printed.  \n  \n     In the following code example, a sample graphic in the shape of a red rectangle is created in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler to act as material to be printed.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500))  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red,   \n         new Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Red,  \n             Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    ```  \n  \n     You may also want to write code for the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.BeginPrint> and <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> events, perhaps including an integer representing the total number of pages to print that is decremented as each page prints.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component to your form to provide a clean and efficient user interface (UI) to your users. Setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog.Document%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component enables you to set properties related to the print document you are working with on your form.
