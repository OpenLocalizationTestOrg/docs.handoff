Synchronous server sockets are not suitable for applications that make heavy use of the network in their operation, but they can be suitable for simple network applications.  \n  \n After a <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket> is set to listen on an endpoint using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Bind%2A> and <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Listen%2A> methods, it is ready to accept incoming connection requests using the <xref:System.Net.Sockets.Socket.Accept%2A> method. The application is suspended until a connection request is received when the **Accept** method is called.  \n  \n When a connection request is received, **Accept** returns a new **Socket** instance that is associated with the connecting client. The following example reads data from the client, displays it on the console, and echoes the data back to the client. The **Socket** does not specify any messaging protocol, so the string \"\\<EOF>\" marks the end of the message data. It assumes that a **Socket** named `listener` has been initialized and bound to an endpoint.  \n  \n```vb  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Waiting for a connection...\")  \nDim handler As Socket = listener.Accept()  \nDim data As String = Nothing  \n  \nWhile True  \n    bytes = New Byte(1024) {}  \n    Dim bytesRec As Integer = handler.Receive(bytes)  \n    data += Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes, 0, bytesRec)  \n    If data.IndexOf(\"<EOF>\") > - 1 Then  \n        Exit While  \n    End If  \nEnd While  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Text received : {0}\", data)  \n  \nDim msg As Byte() = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data)  \nhandler.Send(msg)  \nhandler.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both)  \nhandler.Close()  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Waiting for a connection...\");  \nSocket handler = listener.Accept();  \nString data = null;  \n  \nwhile (true) {  \n    bytes = new byte[1024];  \n    int bytesRec = handler.Receive(bytes);  \n    data += Encoding.ASCII.GetString(bytes,0,bytesRec);  \n    if (data.IndexOf(\"<EOF>\") > -1) {  \n        break;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine( \"Text received : {0}\", data);  \n  \nbyte[] msg = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);  \nhandler.Send(msg);  \nhandler.Shutdown(SocketShutdown.Both);  \nhandler.Close();  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Using an Asynchronous Server Socket](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/using-an-asynchronous-server-socket.md)   \n [Synchronous Server Socket Example](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/synchronous-server-socket-example.md)   \n [Listening with Sockets](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/listening-with-sockets.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,761],"nodes":[{"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,50],"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,50]}]}],"pos":[6,59],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Using a Synchronous Server Socket | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
