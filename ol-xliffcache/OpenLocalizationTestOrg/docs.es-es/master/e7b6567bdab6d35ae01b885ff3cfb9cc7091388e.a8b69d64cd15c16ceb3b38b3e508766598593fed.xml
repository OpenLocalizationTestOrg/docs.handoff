The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> displays a three-dimensional (3-D) cone. Rendering 3-D objects is much easier with the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] than with [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]. Therefore, it makes sense to host a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> class to create 3-D graphics in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)].  \n  \n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  \n  \n-   Creating the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  \n  \n-   Creating the Windows Forms host project.  \n  \n-   Hosting the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  \n  \n For a complete code listing of the tasks illustrated in this walkthrough, see [Hosting a 3-D WPF Composite Control in Windows Forms Sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160001).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../../../../includes/vs-orcas-long-md.md)].  \n  \n<a name=\"To_Create_the_UserControl\"></a>   \n## Creating the UserControl  \n  \n#### To create the UserControl  \n  \n1.  Create a WPF User Control Library project named `HostingWpfUserControlInWf`.  \n  \n2.  Open UserControl1.xaml in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n3.  Replace the generated code with the following code.  \n  \n     This code defines a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl?displayProperty=fullName> that contains two child controls. The first child control is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label?displayProperty=fullName> control; the second is a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Viewport3D> control that displays a 3-D cone.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/CSharp/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/ConeControl.xaml#1)]  \n  \n<a name=\"To_Create_the_Windows_Forms_Host_Project\"></a>   \n## Creating the Windows Forms Host Project  \n  \n#### To create the host project  \n  \n1.  Add a Windows application project named `WpfUserControlHost` to the solution. For more information, see [How to: Create a New WPF Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1f6aea7a-33e1-4d3f-8555-1daa42e95d82).  \n  \n2.  In Solution Explorer, add a reference to the WindowsFormsIntegration assembly, which is named WindowsFormsIntegration.dll.  \n  \n3.  Add references to the following [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] assemblies:  \n  \n    -   PresentationCore  \n  \n    -   PresentationFramework  \n  \n    -   WindowsBase  \n  \n4.  Add a reference to the `HostingWpfUserControlInWf` project.  \n  \n5.  In Solution Explorer, set the `WpfUserControlHost` project to be the startup project.  \n  \n<a name=\"To_Host_the_Windows_Presentation_Foundation\"></a>   \n## Hosting the Windows Presentation Foundation UserControl  \n  \n#### To host the UserControl  \n  \n1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, open Form1.  \n  \n2.  In the Properties window, click **Events**, and then double-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event to create an event handler.  \n  \n     The Code Editor opens to the newly generated `Form1_Load` event handler.  \n  \n3.  Replace the code in Form1.cs with the following code.  \n  \n     The `Form1_Load` event handler creates an instance of `UserControl1` and adds itto the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control's collection of child controls. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control is added to the form's collection of child controls.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/CSharp/WpfUserControlHost/Form1.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[HostingWpfUserControlInWf#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingWpfUserControlInWf/VisualBasic/WpfUserControlHost/Form1.vb#10)]  \n  \n4.
