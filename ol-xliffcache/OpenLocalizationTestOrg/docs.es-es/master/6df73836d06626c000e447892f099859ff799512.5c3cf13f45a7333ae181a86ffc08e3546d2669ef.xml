These built-in claims are designed to model information found in client credential types that [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] supports by default. In many cases, the built-in claims are sufficient; however some applications may require custom claims. A claim consists of the claim type, the resource for which the claim applies to and the right that is asserted over that resource. This topic describes how to create a custom claim.  \n  \n### To create a custom claim that is based on a primitive data type  \n  \n1.  Create a custom claim by passing the claim type, resource value and right to the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.String%29> constructor.  \n  \n    1.  Decide on a unique value for the claim type.  \n  \n         The claim type is a unique string identifier. It is the custom claim designer's responsibility to ensure that the string identifier that is used for the claim type is unique. For a list of claim types that are defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], see the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimTypes> class.  \n  \n    2.  Choose the primitive data type and value for the resource.  \n  \n         A resource is an object. The CLR type of the resource can be a primitive, such as <xref:System.String> or <xref:System.Int32>, or any serializable type. The CLR type of the resource must be serializable, because claims are serialized at various points by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]. Primitive types are serializable.  \n  \n    3.  Choose a right that is defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] or a unique value for a custom right.  \n  \n         A right is a unique string identifier. The rights that are defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] are defined in the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Rights> class.  \n  \n         It is the custom claim designer's responsibility to ensure that the string identifier that is used for the right is unique.  \n  \n         The following code example creates a custom claim with a claim type of `http://example.org/claims/simplecustomclaim`, for a resource named `Driver's License`, and with the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Rights.PossessProperty%2A> right.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_CustomClaim#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customclaim/cs/c_customclaim.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[c_CustomClaim#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customclaim/vb/c_customclaim.vb#4)]  \n  \n### To create a custom claim that is based on a non-primitive data type  \n  \n1.  Create a custom claim by passing the claim type, resource value and right to the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Claim.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.String%29> constructor.  \n  \n    1.  Decide on a unique value for the claim type.  \n  \n         The claim type is a unique string identifier. It is the custom claim designer's responsibility to ensure that the string identifier that is used for the claim type is unique. For a list of claim types that are defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], see the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimTypes> class.  \n  \n    2.  Choose or define a serializable non-primitive type for the resource.  \n  \n         A resource is an object. The CLR type of the resource must be serializable, because claims are serialized at various points by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]. Primitive types are already serializable.  \n  \n         When a new type is defined, apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> to the class. Also apply the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> attribute to the all members of the new type that need to be serialized as part of the claim.  \n  \n         The following code example defines a custom resource type named `MyResourceType`.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_CustomClaim#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customclaim/cs/c_customclaim.cs#2)] \n         [!code-vb[c_CustomClaim#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customclaim/vb/c_customclaim.vb#2)]        \n  \n    3.  Choose a right that is defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] or a unique value for a custom right.  \n  \n         A right is a unique string identifier. The rights that are defined by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] are defined in the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Rights> class.  \n  \n         It is the custom claim designer's responsibility to ensure that the string identifier that is used for the right is unique.  \n  \n         The following code example creates a custom claim with a claim type of `http://example.org/claims/complexcustomclaim`, a custom resource type of `MyResourceType`, and with the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.Rights.PossessProperty%2A> right.  \n  \n         [!code-csharp[c_CustomClaim#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_customclaim/cs/c_customclaim.cs#5)] \n
