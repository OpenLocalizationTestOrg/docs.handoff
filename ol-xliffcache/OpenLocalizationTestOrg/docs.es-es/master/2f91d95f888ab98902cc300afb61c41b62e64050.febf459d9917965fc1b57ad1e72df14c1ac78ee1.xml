For example, the LINQ provider implements the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryable%601> interface for querying relational data stores. The Visual Basic compiler compiles queries that target such data sources into code that builds an expression tree at runtime. The query provider can then traverse the expression tree data structure and translate it into a query language appropriate for the data source.  \n  \n Expression trees are also used in LINQ to represent lambda expressions that are assigned to variables of type <xref:System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%601>.  \n  \n This topic describes how to use expression trees to create dynamic LINQ queries. Dynamic queries are useful when the specifics of a query are not known at compile time. For example, an application might provide a user interface that enables the end user to specify one or more predicates to filter the data. In order to use LINQ for querying, this kind of application must use expression trees to create the LINQ query at runtime.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows you how to use expression trees to construct a query against an `IQueryable` data source and then execute it. The code builds an expression tree to represent the following query:  \n  \n `companies.Where(Function(company) company.ToLower() = \"coho winery\" OrElse company.Length > 16).OrderBy(Function(company) company)`  \n  \n The factory methods in the <xref:System.Linq.Expressions> namespace are used to create expression trees that represent the expressions that make up the overall query. The expressions that represent calls to the standard query operator methods refer to the <xref:System.Linq.Queryable> implementations of these methods. The final expression tree is passed to the <xref:System.Linq.IQueryProvider.CreateQuery%60%601%28System.Linq.Expressions.Expression%29> implementation of the provider of the `IQueryable` data source to create an executable query of type `IQueryable`. The results are obtained by enumerating that query variable.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Add an Imports statement for System.Linq.Expressions.  \n  \nDim companies =   \n    {\"Consolidated Messenger\", \"Alpine Ski House\", \"Southridge Video\", \"City Power & Light\",   \n     \"Coho Winery\", \"Wide World Importers\", \"Graphic Design Institute\", \"Adventure Works\",   \n     \"Humongous Insurance\", \"Woodgrove Bank\", \"Margie's Travel\", \"Northwind Traders\",   \n     \"Blue Yonder Airlines\", \"Trey Research\", \"The Phone Company\",   \n     \"Wingtip Toys\", \"Lucerne Publishing\", \"Fourth Coffee\"}  \n  \n' The IQueryable data to query.  \nDim queryableData As IQueryable(Of String) = companies.AsQueryable()  \n  \n' Compose the expression tree that represents the parameter to the predicate.  \nDim pe As ParameterExpression = Expression.Parameter(GetType(String), \"company\")  \n  \n' ***** Where(Function(company) company.ToLower() = \"coho winery\" OrElse company.Length > 16) *****  \n' Create an expression tree that represents the expression: company.ToLower() = \"coho winery\".  \nDim left As Expression = Expression.Call(pe, GetType(String).GetMethod(\"ToLower\", System.Type.EmptyTypes))  \nDim right As Expression = Expression.Constant(\"coho winery\")  \nDim e1 As Expression = Expression.Equal(left, right)  \n  \n' Create an expression tree that represents the expression: company.Length > 16.  \nleft = Expression.Property(pe, GetType(String).GetProperty(\"Length\"))  \nright = Expression.Constant(16, GetType(Integer))  \nDim e2 As Expression = Expression.GreaterThan(left, right)  \n  \n' Combine the expressions to create an expression tree that represents the  \n' expression: company.ToLower() = \"coho winery\" OrElse company.Length > 16).  \nDim predicateBody As Expression = Expression.OrElse(e1, e2)  \n  \n' Create an expression tree that represents the expression:  \n' queryableData.Where(Function(company) company.ToLower() = \"coho winery\" OrElse company.Length > 16)  \nDim whereCallExpression As MethodCallExpression = Expression.Call(   \n        GetType(Queryable),   \n        \"Where\",   \n        New Type() {queryableData.ElementType},   \n        queryableData.Expression,   \n        Expression.Lambda(Of Func(Of String, Boolean))(predicateBody, New ParameterExpression() {pe}))  \n' ***** End Where *****  \n  \n' ***** OrderBy(Function(company) company) *****  \n' Create an expression tree that represents the expression:  \n' whereCallExpression.OrderBy(Function(company) company)  \nDim orderByCallExpression As MethodCallExpression = Expression.Call(   \n        GetType(Queryable),   \n        \"OrderBy\",   \n        New Type() {queryableData.ElementType, queryableData.ElementType},   \n        whereCallExpression,   \n        Expression.Lambda(Of Func(Of String, String))(pe, New ParameterExpression() {pe}))  \n' ***** End OrderBy *****  \n  \n' Create an executable query from the expression tree.  \nDim results As IQueryable(Of String) = queryableData.Provider.CreateQuery(Of String)(orderByCallExpression)  \n  \n' Enumerate the results.  \nFor Each company As String In results  \n    Console.WriteLine(company)  \nNext  \n  \n' This code produces the following output:  \n'  \n' Blue Yonder Airlines  \n' City Power & Light  \n' Coho Winery  \n' Consolidated Messenger  \n' Graphic Design Institute  \n' Humongous Insurance  \n' Lucerne Publishing  \n' Northwind Traders  \n' The Phone Company  \n' Wide World Importers  \n```  \n  \n This code uses a fixed number of expressions in the predicate that is passed to the `Queryable.Where` method. However, you can write an application that combines a variable number of predicate expressions that depends on the user input. You can also vary the standard query operators that are called in the query, depending on the input from the user.  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n  \n-   Create a new **Console Application** project.  \n  \n-   Add a reference to System.Core.dll if it is not already referenced.  \n  \n-   Include the System.Linq.Expressions namespace.  \n  \n-   Copy the code from the example and paste it into the `Main` `Sub` procedure.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Expression Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)\n- [How to: Execute Expression Trees
