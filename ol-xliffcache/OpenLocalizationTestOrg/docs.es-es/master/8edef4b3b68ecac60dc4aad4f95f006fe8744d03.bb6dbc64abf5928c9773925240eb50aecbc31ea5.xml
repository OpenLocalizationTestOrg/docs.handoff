Defining endpoints in code is usually not practical because the bindings and addresses for a deployed service are typically different from those used while the service is being developed. More generally, keeping the binding and addressing information out of the code allows them to change without having to recompile or redeploy the application.  \n  \n#### To create a service endpoint in code  \n  \n1.  Create the interface that defines the service contract.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/cs/source.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[c_HowTo_CodeServiceBinding#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_codeservicebinding/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n2.
