There are three reasons to group controls:  \n  \n-   To create a visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface.  \n  \n-   To create programmatic grouping (of radio buttons, for example).  \n  \n-   For moving the controls as a unit at design time.  \n  \n### To create a group of controls  \n  \n1.  Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control on a form.  \n  \n2.  Add other controls to the group box, drawing each inside the group box.  \n  \n     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, and then paste them into the group box. You can also drag them into the group box.  \n  \n3.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property of the group box to an appropriate caption.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox>   \n [GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,91],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,79]}]},{"pos":[589,651],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","linkify":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms GroupBox Control","pos":[0,62]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> controls are used to group other controls.","pos":[652,745],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> controls are used to group other controls."},{"content":"There are three reasons to group controls:","pos":[746,788]},{"content":"To create a visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface.","pos":[798,878]},{"content":"To create programmatic grouping (of radio buttons, for example).","pos":[888,952]},{"content":"For moving the controls as a unit at design time.","pos":[962,1011]},{"pos":[1021,1050],"content":"To create a group of controls","linkify":"To create a group of controls","nodes":[{"content":"To create a group of controls","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Draw a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control on a form.","pos":[1060,1122],"source":"Draw a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control on a form."},{"content":"Add other controls to the group box, drawing each inside the group box.","pos":[1132,1203]},{"content":"If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control, and then paste them into the group box.","pos":[1214,1441],"source":"If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a group box, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, and then paste them into the group box."},{"content":"You can also drag them into the group box.","pos":[1442,1484]},{"content":"Set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A&gt;</ph> property of the group box to an appropriate caption.","pos":[1494,1599],"source":"Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox.Text%2A> property of the group box to an appropriate caption."},{"pos":[1608,1616],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>GroupBox Control<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1660,1759],"source":" [GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)"}]}
