The application definition file defines a resource section (a value for the <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> property). Resources defined at the application level can be accessed by all other pages that are part of the application. In this case, the resource is a declared style. Because a complete style that includes a control template can be lengthy, this example omits the control template that is defined within the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.ContentTemplate%2A> property setter of the style.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[ResourcesApplication#PreTemplateResource](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ResourcesApplication/CS/app.xaml#pretemplateresource)]  \n[!code-xaml[ResourcesApplication#PostTemplateResource](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ResourcesApplication/CS/app.xaml#posttemplateresource)]  \n  \n The following example shows a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page that references the application-level resource that the previous example defined. The resource is referenced by using a     [StaticResource Markup Extension](staticresource-markup-extension.md) that specifies the unique resource key for the requested resource. No resource with key of \"GelButton\" is found in the current page, so the resource lookup scope for the requested resource continues beyond the current page and into the defined application-level resources.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[ResourcesApplication#ConsumingPage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ResourcesApplication/CS/page1.xaml#consumingpage)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [XAML Resources](xaml-resources.md)\n- [Application Management Overview](../app-development/application-management-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](resources-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,218],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Application Resources\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"application resources [WPF]\"\n  - \"resources [WPF], application resources\"\nms.assetid: 507ea937-5191-406b-8797-0a3d9f94156d","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Application Resources","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"How to: Use Application Resources","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Application Resources","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[225,258],"content":"How to: Use Application Resources","linkify":"How to: Use Application Resources","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Application Resources","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to use application resources.","pos":[259,311]},{"pos":[320,327],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows an application definition file.","pos":[331,390]},{"content":"The application definition file defines a resource section (a value for the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A&gt;</ph> property).","pos":[391,524],"source":" The application definition file defines a resource section (a value for the <xref:System.Windows.Application.Resources%2A> property)."},{"content":"Resources defined at the application level can be accessed by all other pages that are part of the application.","pos":[525,636]},{"content":"In this case, the resource is a declared style.","pos":[637,684]},{"content":"Because a complete style that includes a control template can be lengthy, this example omits the control template that is defined within the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.ContentTemplate%2A&gt;</ph> property setter of the style.","pos":[685,920],"source":" Because a complete style that includes a control template can be lengthy, this example omits the control template that is defined within the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContentControl.ContentTemplate%2A> property setter of the style."},{"content":"The following example shows a <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> page that references the application-level resource that the previous example defined.","pos":[1239,1427],"source":"The following example shows a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] page that references the application-level resource that the previous example defined."},{"content":"The resource is referenced by using a     <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>StaticResource Markup Extension<ept id=\"p1\">](staticresource-markup-extension.md)</ept> that specifies the unique resource key for the requested resource.","pos":[1428,1606],"source":" The resource is referenced by using a     [StaticResource Markup Extension](staticresource-markup-extension.md) that specifies the unique resource key for the requested resource."},{"content":"No resource with key of \"GelButton\" is found in the current page, so the resource lookup scope for the requested resource continues beyond the current page and into the defined application-level resources.","pos":[1607,1812]},{"pos":[1968,1976],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1980,2015],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XAML Resources<ept id=\"p1\">](xaml-resources.md)</ept>","source":"[XAML Resources](xaml-resources.md)"},{"pos":[2018,2106],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Application Management Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../app-development/application-management-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Application Management Overview](../app-development/application-management-overview.md)"},{"pos":[2109,2152],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](resources-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[How-to Topics](resources-how-to-topics.md)"}]}
