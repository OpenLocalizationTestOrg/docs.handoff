When handling an event, control authors should override the protected `On`*EventName* method rather than attaching a delegate to the event. For a review of events, see [Raising Events from a Component](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/sh2e3k5z(v=vs.120)).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If there is no data associated with an event, an instance of the base class <xref:System.EventArgs> is passed as an argument to the `On`*EventName* method.  \n  \n## Keyboard Events  \n The common keyboard events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyUp>.  \n  \n|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|  \n|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|  \n|`KeyDown`|`void OnKeyDown(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised only when a key is initially pressed.|  \n|`KeyPress`|`void OnKeyPress`<br /><br /> `(KeyPressEventArgs)`|Raised every time a key is pressed. If a key is held down, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyPress> event is raised at the repeat rate defined by the operating system.|  \n|`KeyUp`|`void OnKeyUp(KeyEventArgs)`|Raised when a key is released.|  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Handling keyboard input is considerably more complex than overriding the events in the preceding table and is beyond the scope of this topic. For more information, see [User Input in Windows Forms](../user-input-in-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n## Mouse Events  \n The mouse events that your control can handle are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseEnter>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseHover>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseLeave>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseUp>.  \n  \n|Event Name|Method to Override|Description of Event|  \n|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|  \n|`MouseDown`|`void OnMouseDown(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is pressed while the pointer is over the control.|  \n|`MouseEnter`|`void OnMouseEnter(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer first enters the region of the control.|  \n|`MouseHover`|`void OnMouseHover(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer hovers over the control.|  \n|`MouseLeave`|`void OnMouseLeave(EventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer leaves the region of the control.|  \n|`MouseMove`|`void OnMouseMove(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the pointer moves in the region of the control.|  \n|`MouseUp`|`void OnMouseUp(MouseEventArgs)`|Raised when the mouse button is released while the pointer is over the control or the pointer leaves the region of the control.|  \n  \n The following code fragment shows an example of overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseDown> event.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/CS/FlashTrackBar.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/VB/FlashTrackBar.vb#7)]  \n  \n The following code fragment shows an example of overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseMove> event.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/CS/FlashTrackBar.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#8](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/VB/FlashTrackBar.vb#8)]  \n  \n The following code fragment shows an example of overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.MouseUp> event.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/CS/FlashTrackBar.cs#9)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar#9](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.FlashTrackBar/VB/FlashTrackBar.vb#9)]  \n  \n For the complete source code for the `FlashTrackBar` sample, see [How to: Create a Windows Forms Control That Shows Progress](how-to-create-a-windows-forms-control-that-shows-progress.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Events in Windows Forms Controls](events-in-windows-forms-controls.md)\n- [Defining an Event](defining-an-event-in-windows-forms-controls.md)\n- [Events](../../../standard/events/index.md)\n- [User Input in Windows Forms](../user-input-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,349],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Handling User Input\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
