It can be especially useful with semi-structured data in text files. LINQ queries can be combined with traditional string functions and regular expressions. For example, you can use the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> or <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A> method to create an array of strings that you can then query or modify by using LINQ. You can use the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.IsMatch%2A> method in the `where` clause of a LINQ query. And you can use LINQ to query or modify the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.MatchCollection> results returned by a regular expression.  \n  \n You can also use the techniques described in this section to transform semi-structured text data to XML. For more information, see [How to: Generate XML from CSV Files](how-to-generate-xml-from-csv-files.md).  \n  \n The examples in this section fall into two categories:  \n  \n## Querying a Block of Text  \n You can query, analyze, and modify text blocks by splitting them into a queryable array of smaller strings by using the <xref:System.String.Split%2A> method or the <xref:System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Split%2A> method. You can split the source text into words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or any other criteria, and then perform additional splits if they are required in your query.  \n  \n [How to: Count Occurrences of a Word in a String (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](how-to-count-occurrences-of-a-word-in-a-string-linq.md)  \n Shows how to use LINQ for simple querying over text.  \n  \n [How to: Query for Sentences that Contain a Specified Set of Words (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](how-to-query-for-sentences-that-contain-a-specified-set-of-words.md)\n\n Shows how to split text files on arbitrary boundaries and how to perform queries against each part.  \n  \n [How to: Query for Characters in a String (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](how-to-query-for-characters-in-a-string-linq.md)  \n Demonstrates that a string is a queryable type.  \n  \n [How to: Combine LINQ Queries with Regular Expressions (Visual Basic)](how-to-combine-linq-queries-with-regular-expressions.md)  \n Shows how to use regular expressions in LINQ queries for complex pattern matching on filtered query results.  \n  \n## Querying Semi-Structured Data in Text Format  \n Many different types of text files consist of a series of lines, often with similar formatting, such as tab- or comma-delimited files or fixed-length lines. After you read such a text file into memory, you can use LINQ to query and/or modify the lines. LINQ queries also simplify the task of combining data from multiple sources.  \n  \n [How to: Find the Set Difference Between Two Lists (LINQ) (Visual
