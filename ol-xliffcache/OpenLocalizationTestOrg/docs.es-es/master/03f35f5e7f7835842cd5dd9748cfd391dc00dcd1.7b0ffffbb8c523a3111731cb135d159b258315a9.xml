This is not an error within your component, because the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] support this data type. However, another component written in strictly CLS-compliant code might not support this data type. Such a component might not be able to interact successfully with your component.  \n  \n The following [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] data types are not CLS-compliant:  \n  \n-   [SByte Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/sbyte-data-type.md)  \n  \n-   [UInteger Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/uinteger-data-type.md)  \n  \n-   [ULong Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/ulong-data-type.md)  \n  \n-   [UShort Data Type](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/ushort-data-type.md)  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC40025  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If your component interfaces only with other [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] components, or does not interface with any other components, you do not need to change anything.  \n  \n-   If you are interfacing with a component not written for the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], you might be able to determine, either through reflection or from documentation, whether it supports this data type. If it does, you do not need to change anything.  \n  \n-   If you are interfacing with a component that does not support this data type, you must replace it with the closest CLS-compliant type. For example, in place of `UInteger` you might be able to use `Integer` if you do not need the value range above 2,147,483,647. If you do need the extended range, you can replace `UInteger` with `Long`.  \n  \n-   If you are interfacing with Automation or COM objects, keep in mind that some types have different data widths than in the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../csharp/getting-started/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)]. For example, `uint` is often 16 bits in other environments. If you are passing a 16-bit argument to such a component, declare it as `UShort` instead of `UInteger` in your managed [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] code.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Reflection](../../../framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)   \n
