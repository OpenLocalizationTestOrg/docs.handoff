Either change the name of '\\<variablename>', or use the fully qualified name (for example, 'Me.variablename' or 'MyBase.variablename').  \n  \n A loop control variable in your code has the same name as a field of the class or other enclosing scope. Because the control variable is used without an `As` clause, it is bound to the field in the enclosing scope, and the compiler does not create a new variable for it or infer its type.  \n  \n In the following example, `Index`, the control variable in the `For` statement, is bound to the `Index` field in the `Customer` class. The compiler does not create a new variable for the control variable `Index` or infer its type.  \n  \n```  \nClass Customer  \n  \n    ' The class has a field named Index.  \n    Private Index As Integer  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n  \n    ' The following line will raise this warning.  \n        For Index = 1 To 10  \n            ' ...  \n        Next  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n  \n```  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For information about how to hide warnings or how to treat warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42110  \n  \n### To address this warning  \n  \n-   Make the loop control variable local by changing its name to an identifier that is not also the name of a field of the class.  \n  \n    ```  \n    For I = 1 To 10  \n    ```  \n  \n-   Clarify that the loop control variable binds to the class field by prefixing `Me.` to the variable name.  \n  \n    ```  \n    For Me.Index = 1 To 10  \n    ```  \n  \n-   Instead of relying on local type inference, use an `As` clause to specify a type for the loop control variable.  \n  \n    ```  \n    For Index As Integer = 1 To 10  \n    ```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code shows the earlier example with the first correction in place.  \n  \n```  \nClass Customer  \n  \n    ' The class has a field named Index.  \n    Private Index As Integer  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n  \n        For I = 1 To 10  \n            ' ...  \n        Next  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Option Infer Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-infer-statement.md)   \n [For Each...Next
