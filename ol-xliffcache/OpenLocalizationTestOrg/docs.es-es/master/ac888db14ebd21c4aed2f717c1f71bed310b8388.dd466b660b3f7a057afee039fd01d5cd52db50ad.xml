WebSockets is an efficient, standards-based technology that enables bidirectional communication over the standard HTTP ports 80 and 443. The use of the standard HTTP ports allow WebSockets to communicate across the web through intermediaries.  Two new standard bindings have been added to support communication over a WebSocket transport. <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpsBinding>. WebSockets-specific settings can be configured on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement> by accessing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement.WebSocketSettings%2A> property.\n  \n## In This Section  \n [Using the NetHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-the-nethttpbinding.md)  \n Discusses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding> and how to configure it.  \n  \n [How to: Create a WCF Service that Communicates over WebSockets](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-wcf-service-that-communicates-over-websockets.md)  \n Describes how to create a WCF service that communicates over Websockets.  \n  \n## Reference  \n  \n## Related Sections\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,102],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"WCF and WebSockets\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 1e53b49e-022c-49c7-8984-4b21b53c05b3","nodes":[{"content":"WCF and WebSockets","nodes":[{"pos":[0,18],"content":"WCF and WebSockets","nodes":[{"content":"WCF and WebSockets","pos":[0,18]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[109,127],"content":"WCF and WebSockets","linkify":"WCF and WebSockets","nodes":[{"content":"WCF and WebSockets","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The .NET Framework 4.5 introduces support for WebSockets in Windows Communication Foundation.","pos":[128,221]},{"content":"WebSockets is an efficient, standards-based technology that enables bidirectional communication over the standard HTTP ports 80 and 443.","pos":[223,359]},{"content":"The use of the standard HTTP ports allow WebSockets to communicate across the web through intermediaries.","pos":[360,465]},{"content":"Two new standard bindings have been added to support communication over a WebSocket transport.","pos":[467,561]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpsBinding&gt;</ph>.","pos":[562,651],"source":"<xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpsBinding>."},{"content":"WebSockets-specific settings can be configured on the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement&gt;</ph> by accessing the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement.WebSocketSettings%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[652,881],"source":" WebSockets-specific settings can be configured on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement> by accessing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.HttpTransportBindingElement.WebSocketSettings%2A> property."},{"pos":[888,903],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using the NetHttpBinding<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-the-nethttpbinding.md)</ept>","pos":[907,1009],"source":"[Using the NetHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/using-the-nethttpbinding.md)"},{"content":"Discusses the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding&gt;</ph> and how to configure it.","pos":[1013,1093],"source":"Discusses the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetHttpBinding> and how to configure it."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a WCF Service that Communicates over WebSockets<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-wcf-service-that-communicates-over-websockets.md)</ept>","pos":[1100,1277],"source":"[How to: Create a WCF Service that Communicates over WebSockets](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-wcf-service-that-communicates-over-websockets.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to create a WCF service that communicates over Websockets.","pos":[1281,1353]},{"pos":[1362,1371],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"pos":[1380,1396],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]}]}
