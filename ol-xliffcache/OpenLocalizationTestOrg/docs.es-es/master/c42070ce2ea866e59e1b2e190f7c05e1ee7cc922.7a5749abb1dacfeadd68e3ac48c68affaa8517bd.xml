You can optionally acquire the resource with the `Using` statement. When you exit the `Using` block, Visual Basic automatically disposes of the resource so that it is available for other code to use. The resource must be local and disposable. For more information, see [Using Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md).  \n  \n## With...End With Construction  \n The `With...End With` construction lets you specify an object reference once and then run a series of statements that access its members. This can simplify your code and improve performance because Visual Basic does not have to re-establish the reference for each statement that accesses it. For more information, see [With...End With Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Control
