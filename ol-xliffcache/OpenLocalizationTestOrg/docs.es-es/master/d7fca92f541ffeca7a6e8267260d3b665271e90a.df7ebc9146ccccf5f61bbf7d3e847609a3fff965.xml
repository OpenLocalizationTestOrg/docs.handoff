This makes it easy for other developers to find and use your objects.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Extending the My Namespace in Visual Basic](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/extending-the-my-namespace.md)  \n Describes how to add custom members and values to the `My` namespace in Visual Basic.  \n  \n [Packaging and Deploying Custom My Extensions](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/packaging-and-deploying-custom-my-extensions.md)  \n Describes how to publish custom `My` namespace extensions by using Visual Studio templates.  \n  \n [Extending the Visual Basic Application Model](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/extending-the-visual-basic-application-model.md)  \n Describes how to specify your own extensions to the application model by overriding members of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase> class.  \n  \n [Customizing Which Objects are Available in My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/customizing-extending-my/customizing-which-objects-are-available-in-my.md)  \n Describes how to control which `My` objects are enabled by setting your project's \\_MYTYPE conditional-compilation constant.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Development with My](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/index.md)  \n Describes which `My` objects are available in different project types by default.  \n  \n [Overview of the Visual Basic Application Model](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/overview-of-the-visual-basic-application-model.md)  \n Describes Visual Basic's model for controlling the behavior of Windows Forms applications.  \n  \n [How My Depends on Project Type](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/development-with-my/how-my-depends-on-project-type.md)  \n Describes which `My` objects are available in different project types by default.  \n  \n [Conditional Compilation](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/conditional-compilation.md)  \n Discusses how the compiler uses conditional-compilation to select particular sections of code to compile and exclude other sections.  \n  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase>  \n Describes the `My` object that provides properties, methods, and events related to the current application.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Developing Applications with Visual
