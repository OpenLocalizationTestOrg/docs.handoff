In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the `partial` modifier. If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword `partial`.  \n  \n This error also occurs if you declare a class and accidentally give it the same name as a partial class that's declared elsewhere in the same namespace.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0260:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0260.cs  \n// You must mark both parts of the definition of class C   \n// by using the partial keyword.  \n  \n// The following line causes CS0260. To resolve the error, add  \n// the 'partial' keyword to the declaration.  \nclass C    \n{  \n}  \n  \npartial class C  \n{  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Partial Classes and Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0260 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0260 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[542,563],"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0260","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0260","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Missing partial modifier on declaration of type 'type'; another partial declaration of this type exists","pos":[564,667]},{"content":"This error indicates that you have declared multiple classes that have the same name.","pos":[674,759]},{"content":"In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the <ph id=\"ph1\">`partial`</ph> modifier.","pos":[760,850],"source":" In addition, at least one but not all of the declarations contains the `partial` modifier."},{"content":"If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword <ph id=\"ph1\">`partial`</ph>.","pos":[851,957],"source":" If you want to define a class in several parts, you must declare each part by using the keyword `partial`."},{"content":"This error also occurs if you declare a class and accidentally give it the same name as a partial class that's declared elsewhere in the same namespace.","pos":[964,1116]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0260:","pos":[1123,1161]},{"pos":[1465,1473],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1477,1592],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Partial Classes and Methods<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)</ept>","source":"[Partial Classes and Methods](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods.md)"}]}
