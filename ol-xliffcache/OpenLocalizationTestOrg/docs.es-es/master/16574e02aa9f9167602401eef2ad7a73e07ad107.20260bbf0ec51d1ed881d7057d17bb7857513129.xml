This article describes how to configure tab completion for three shells, PowerShell, Bash, and zsh. Other shells may have support for auto completion. Refer to their documentation on how to configure auto completion, the steps should be similar to the steps described in this article.\n\n[!INCLUDE [topic-appliesto-net-core-2plus](~/includes/topic-appliesto-net-core-2plus.md)]\n\nOnce setup, tab completion for the .NET Core CLI is triggered by typing a `dotnet` command in the shell, and then pressing the TAB key. The current command line is sent to the `dotnet complete` command, and the results are processed by your shell. You can test the results without enabling tab completion by sending something directly to the `dotnet complete` command. For example:\n\n```\n> dotnet complete \"dotnet a\"\nadd\nclean\n--diagnostics\nmigrate\npack\n```\n\nIf that command doesn't work, make sure that .NET Core 2.0 SDK or above is installed. If it's installed, but that command still doesn't work, make sure that the `dotnet` command resolves to a version of .NET Core 2.0 SDK and above. Use the `dotnet --version` command to see what version of `dotnet` your current path is resolving to. For more information, see [Select the .NET Core version to use](../versions/selection.md).\n\n### Examples\n\nHere are some examples of what tab completion provides:\n\nInput                                | becomes                                                                     | because\n:------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------\n`dotnet a⇥`                          | `dotnet add`                                                                 | `add` is the first subcommand, alphabetically.\n`dotnet add p⇥`                      | `dotnet add --help`                                                          | Tab completion matches substrings and `--help` comes first alphabetically.\n`dotnet add p⇥⇥`                    | `dotnet add package`                                                          | Pressing tab a second time brings up the next suggestion.      \n`dotnet add package Microsoft⇥`      | `dotnet add package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web`                      | Results are returned alphabetically.\n`dotnet remove reference ⇥`          | `dotnet remove reference ..\\..\\src\\OmniSharp.DotNet\\OmniSharp.DotNet.csproj` | Tab completion is project file aware.\n\n## PowerShell\n\nTo add tab completion to **PowerShell** for the .NET Core CLI, create or edit the profile stored in the variable `$PROFILE`. For more information, see [How to create your profile](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-6#how-to-create-a-profile) and [Profiles and execution policy](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-6#profiles-and-execution-policy). \n\nAdd the following code to your profile:\n\n```powershell\n# PowerShell parameter completion shim for the dotnet CLI \nRegister-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName dotnet -ScriptBlock {\n     param($commandName, $wordToComplete, $cursorPosition)\n         dotnet complete --position $cursorPosition \"$wordToComplete\" | ForEach-Object {\n            [System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new($_, $_, 'ParameterValue', $_)\n         }\n }\n```\n\n## Bash\n\nTo add tab completion to your **bash** shell for the .NET Core CLI, add the following code to your `.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\n# bash parameter completion for the dotnet CLI\n\n_dotnet_bash_complete()\n{\n  local word=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}\n\n  local completions\n  completions=\"$(dotnet complete --position \"${COMP_POINT}\" \"${COMP_LINE}\")\"\n\n  COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W \"$completions\" -- \"$word\") )\n}\n\ncomplete -f -F _dotnet_bash_complete dotnet\n```\n\n## Zsh\n\nTo add tab completion to your **zsh** shell for the .NET Core CLI, add the following code to your `.zshrc` file:\n\n```zsh\n# zsh parameter completion for the dotnet CLI\n\n_dotnet_zsh_complete() \n{\n  local completions=(\"$(dotnet complete \"$words\")\")\n\n  reply=( \"${(ps:\\n:)completions}\" )\n}\n\ncompctl -K _dotnet_zsh_complete dotnet\n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,205],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Enable tab completion\ndescription:
