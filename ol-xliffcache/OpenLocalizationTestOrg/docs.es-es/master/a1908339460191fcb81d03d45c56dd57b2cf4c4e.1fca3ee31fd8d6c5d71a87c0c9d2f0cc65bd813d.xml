For an overview of the tutorials, see [Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications](getting-started-tutorial.md).\n\nWhen you create a WCF service, your first task is to define a service contract. The service contract specifies what operations the service supports. An operation can be thought of as a Web service method. You create service contracts by defining a Visual C# or Visual Basic (VB) interface. An interface has the following characteristics:\n\n- Each method in the interface corresponds to a specific service operation. \n- For each interface, you must apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute.\n- For each operation/method, you must apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute. \n\nIn this tutorial, you learn how to:\n> [!div class=\"checklist\"]\n> - Create a **WCF Service Library** project.\n> - Define a service contract interface.\n\n## Create a WCF Service Library project and define a service contract interface\n\n1. Open Visual Studio as an administrator. To do so, select the Visual Studio program in the **Start** menu, and then select **More** > **Run as administrator** from the shortcut menu.\n\n2. Create a **WCF Service Library** project.\n\n   1. From the **File** menu, select **New** > **Project**.\n\n   2. In the **New Project** dialog, on the left-hand side, expand **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic**, and then select the **WCF** category. Visual Studio displays a list of project templates in the center section of the window. Select **WCF Service Library**.\n\n      > [!NOTE]\n      > If you don't see the **WCF** project template category, you may need to install the **Windows Communication Foundation** component of Visual Studio. In the **New Project** dialog box, select the **Open Visual Studio Installer** link on the left side. Select the **Individual components** tab, and then find and select **Windows Communication Foundation** under the **Development activities** category. Choose **Modify** to begin installing the component.\n\n   3. In the bottom section of the window, enter *GettingStartedLib* for the **Name** and *GettingStarted* for the **Solution name**. \n\n   4. Select **OK**.\n\n      Visual Studio creates the project, which has three files: *IService1.cs* (or *IService1.vb* for a Visual Basic project), *Service1.cs* (or *Service1.vb* for a Visual Basic project), and *App.config*. Visual Studio defines these files as follows: \n      - The *IService1* file contains the default definition of the service contract. \n      - The *Service1* file contains the default implementation of the service contract. \n      - The *App.config* file contains the configuration info needed to load the default service with the Visual Studio WCF Service Host tool. For more information about the WCF Service Host tool, see [WCF Service Host (WcfSvcHost.exe)](wcf-service-host-wcfsvchost-exe.md).\n\n      > [!NOTE]\n      > If you installed Visual Studio with Visual Basic developer environment settings, the solution might be hidden. If this is the case, select **Options** from the **Tools** menu, then select **Projects and Solutions** > **General** in the **Options** window. Select **Always show solution**. Also, verify that **Save new projects when created** is selected.\n\n3. From **Solution Explorer**, open the **IService1.cs** or **IService1.vb** file, and replace its code with the following code:\n\n    ```csharp\n    using System;\n    using System.ServiceModel;\n\n    namespace GettingStartedLib\n    {\n            [ServiceContract(Namespace = \"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")]\n            public interface ICalculator\n            {\n                [OperationContract]\n                double Add(double n1, double n2);\n                [OperationContract]\n                double Subtract(double n1, double n2);\n                [OperationContract]\n                double Multiply(double n1, double n2);\n                [OperationContract]\n                double Divide(double n1, double n2);\n            }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```vb\n    Imports System.ServiceModel\n\n    Namespace GettingStartedLib\n\n        <ServiceContract(Namespace:=\"http://Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples\")> _\n        Public Interface ICalculator\n\n            <OperationContract()> _\n            Function Add(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double\n            <OperationContract()> _\n            Function Subtract(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double\n            <OperationContract()> _\n            Function Multiply(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double\n            <OperationContract()> _\n            Function Divide(ByVal n1 As Double, ByVal n2 As Double) As Double\n        End Interface\n    End Namespace\n    ```\n\n     This contract defines an online calculator. Notice the `ICalculator` interface is marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute (simplified as `ServiceContract`). This attribute defines a namespace to disambiguate the contract name. The code marks each calculator operation with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute (simplified as `OperationContract`).\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to:\n> [!div class=\"checklist\"]\n> - Create a WCF Service Library project.\n> - Define a service contract interface.\n\nAdvance to the next tutorial to learn how to implement the WCF service contract.\n\n> [!div class=\"nextstepaction\"]\n> [Tutorial: Implement a WCF service contract](how-to-implement-a-wcf-contract.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract\"\nms.date: 03/19/2019\nhelpviewer_keywords:\n  - \"service contracts [WCF], defining\"\ndev_langs:\n - CSharp\n - VB\nms.assetid: 67bf05b7-1d08-4911-83b7-a45d0b036fc3","nodes":[{"content":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","nodes":[{"content":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","pos":[0,68]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[245,313],"content":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","linkify":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","nodes":[{"content":"Tutorial: Define a Windows Communication Foundation service contract","pos":[0,68]}]},{"content":"This tutorial describes the first of five tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application.","pos":[315,441]},{"content":"For an overview of the tutorials, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications<ept id=\"p1\">](getting-started-tutorial.md)</ept>.","pos":[442,584],"source":" For an overview of the tutorials, see [Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications](getting-started-tutorial.md)."},{"content":"When you create a WCF service, your first task is to define a service contract.","pos":[586,665]},{"content":"The service contract specifies what operations the service supports.","pos":[666,734]},{"content":"An operation can be thought of as a Web service method.","pos":[735,790]},{"content":"You create service contracts by defining a Visual C# or Visual Basic (VB) interface.","pos":[791,875]},{"content":"An interface has the following characteristics:","pos":[876,923]},{"content":"Each method in the interface corresponds to a specific service operation.","pos":[927,1000]},{"pos":[1004,1105],"content":"For each interface, you must apply the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute.","source":"For each interface, you must apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute."},{"pos":[1108,1218],"content":"For each operation/method, you must apply the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute.","source":"For each operation/method, you must apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute."},{"content":"In this tutorial, you learn how to:","pos":[1221,1256]},{"pos":[1288,1329],"content":"Create a <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>WCF Service Library<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> project.","source":"Create a **WCF Service Library** project."},{"content":"Define a service contract interface.","pos":[1334,1370]},{"pos":[1375,1451],"content":"Create a WCF Service Library project and define a service contract interface","linkify":"Create a WCF Service Library project and define a service contract interface","nodes":[{"content":"Create a WCF Service Library project and define a service contract interface","pos":[0,76]}]},{"content":"Open Visual Studio as an administrator.","pos":[1456,1495]},{"content":"To do so, select the Visual Studio program in the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> menu, and then select <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>More<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> &gt;
