The following sections outline the steps for this configuration:  \n  \n-   Install (or confirm the installation of) the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] activation components.  \n  \n-   Configure WAS to support a non-HTTP protocol. The following procedure configures [!INCLUDE[wv](../../../../includes/wv-md.md)] for TCP activation.  \n  \n After installing and configuring WAS, see [How to: Host a WCF Service in WAS](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-host-a-wcf-service-in-was.md) for the procedures to create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that exposes an non-HTTP endpoint that employs WAS.  \n  \n### To install the WCF non-HTTP activation components  \n  \n1.  Click the **Start** button, and then click **Control Panel**.  \n  \n2.  Click **Programs**, and then click **Programs and Features**.  \n  \n3.  On the **Tasks** menu, click **Turn Windows features on or off**.  \n  \n4.  Find the [!INCLUDE[vstecwinfx](../../../../includes/vstecwinfx-md.md)] node, select and then expand it.  \n  \n5.  Select the **WCF Non-Http Activation Components** box and save the setting.  \n  \n### To configure the WAS to support TCP activation  \n  \n1.  To support net.tcp activation, the default Web site must first be bound to a net.tcp port. You can do this by using Appcmd.exe, which is installed with the [!INCLUDE[iisver](../../../../includes/iisver-md.md)] management toolset. In an administrator-level Command Prompt window, run the following command.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set site \"Default Web Site\" -+bindings.[protocol='net.tcp',bindingInformation='808:*']  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This command is a single line of text. This command adds a net.tcp site binding to the default Web site listening on TCP port 808 with any host name.  \n  \n2.  Although all applications within a site share a common net.tcp binding, each application can enable net.tcp support individually. To enable net.tcp for the application, run the following command from an administrator-level command prompt.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set app   \n    \"Default Web Site/<WCF Application>\" /enabledProtocols:http,net.tcp  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This command is a single line of text. This command enables the /\\<*WCF Application*> application to be accessed using both http://localhost*/\\<WCF Application>* and net.tcp://localhost/*\\<WCF Application>*.  \n  \n     Remove the net.tcp site binding you added for this sample.  \n  \n     As a convenience, the following two steps are implemented in a batch file called RemoveNetTcpSiteBinding.cmd located in the sample directory.  \n  \n    1.  Remove net.tcp from the list of enabled protocols by running the following command in an administrator-level Command Prompt window.  \n  \n        ```  \n        %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set app   \n        \"Default Web Site/servicemodelsamples<WCF Application>\" \" /enabledProtocols:http  \n        ```  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  This command is a single line of text.  \n  \n    2.  Remove the net.tcp site binding by running the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window:  \n  \n        ```  \n        %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set site \"Default Web Site\"   \n        --bindings.[protocol='net.tcp',bindingInformation='808:*']  \n        ```  \n  \n        > [!NOTE]\n        >  This command is a single line of text.  \n  \n### To remove net.tcp from the list of enabled protocols  \n  \n1.  To remove net.tcp from the list of enabled protocols, run the following command in an administrator-level Command Prompt window.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set app \"Default Web Site/servicemodelsamples<WCF Application>\" \" /enabledProtocols:http  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This command is a single line of text.  \n  \n### To remove the net.tcp site binding  \n  \n1.  To remove the net.tcp site binding run the following command in an administrator-level Command Prompt window.  \n  \n    ```  \n    %windir%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe set site \"Default Web Site\"   \n    -bindings.[protocol='net.tcp',bindingInformation='808:*']  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This command is a single line of text.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [TCP
