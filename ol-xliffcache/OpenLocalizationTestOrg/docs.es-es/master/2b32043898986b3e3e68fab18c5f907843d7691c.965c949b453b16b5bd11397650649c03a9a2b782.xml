A shared variable identifies exactly one storage location. A variable declared with the `WithEvents` modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises. When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the `WithEvents` declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the `Add` method.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30594  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Declare your event handler `Shared`.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Shared](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)\n- [WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30594\"\n  - \"vbc30594\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30594\"\nms.assetid: 5b9fceb4-ab11-41bb-ad3b-6f1a9da8ae7e","nodes":[{"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","nodes":[{"pos":[0,77],"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","nodes":[{"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","pos":[0,77]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[245,322],"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","linkify":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","nodes":[{"content":"Events of shared WithEvents variables cannot be handled by non-shared methods","pos":[0,77]}]},{"content":"A variable declared with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Shared`</ph> modifier is a shared variable.","pos":[323,391],"source":"A variable declared with the `Shared` modifier is a shared variable."},{"content":"A shared variable identifies exactly one storage location.","pos":[392,450]},{"content":"A variable declared with the <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises.","pos":[451,600],"source":" A variable declared with the `WithEvents` modifier asserts that the type to which the variable belongs handles the set of events the variable raises."},{"content":"When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the <ph id=\"ph1\">`WithEvents`</ph> declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Add`</ph> method.","pos":[601,787],"source":" When a value is assigned to the variable, the property created by the `WithEvents` declaration unhooks any existing event handler and hooks up the new event handler via the `Add` method."},{"pos":[794,815],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30594","source":"**Error ID:** BC30594"},{"pos":[824,845],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[855,891],"content":"Declare your event handler <ph id=\"ph1\">`Shared`</ph>.","source":"Declare your event handler `Shared`."},{"pos":[900,908],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[912,982],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Shared<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)</ept>","source":"[Shared](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/shared.md)"},{"pos":[985,1063],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WithEvents<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)</ept>","source":"[WithEvents](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/withevents.md)"}]}
