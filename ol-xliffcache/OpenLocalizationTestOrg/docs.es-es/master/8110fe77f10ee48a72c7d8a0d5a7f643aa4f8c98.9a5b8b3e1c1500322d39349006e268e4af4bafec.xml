You use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> just as you would use an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>. In fact, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is initialized with a connection or connection string that you supply. For more information, see [DataContext Methods (O/R Designer)](/visualstudio/data-tools/datacontext-methods-o-r-designer).  \n  \n The purpose of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is to translate your requests for objects into SQL queries to be made against the database, and then to assemble objects out of the results. The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> enables [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] by implementing the same operator pattern as the Standard Query Operators, such as `Where` and `Select`.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Maintaining a secure connection is of the highest importance. For more information, see [Security in LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/security-in-linq-to-sql.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is used to connect to the Northwind sample database and to retrieve rows of customers whose city is London.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#1](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n Each database table is represented as a `Table` collection available by way of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.GetTable%2A> method, by using the entity class to identify it.  \n  \n## Example  \n Best practice is to declare a strongly typed <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> instead of relying on the basic <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> class and the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext.GetTable%2A> method. A strongly typed <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> declares all `Table` collections as members of the context, as in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#2](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#2)]  \n  \n You can then express the query for customers from London more simply as:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/cs/Program.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase#5](../../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Data/DLinqCommunicatingWithDatabase/vb/Module1.vb#5)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Communicating with the Database](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/communicating-with-the-database.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,360],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Connect to a Database | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-ado\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: c33d74b3-530d-421b-a121-96786dd263a5\ncaps.latest.revision: 2\nauthor: \"JennieHubbard\"\nms.author: \"jhubbard\"\nmanager: \"jhubbard\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Connect to a Database | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"How to: Connect to a Database | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Connect to a Database | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[367,396],"content":"How to: Connect to a Database","linkify":"How to: Connect to a Database","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Connect to a Database","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> is the main conduit by which you connect to a database, retrieve objects from it, and submit changes back to it.","pos":[397,549],"source":"The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is the main conduit by which you connect to a database, retrieve objects from it, and submit changes back to it."},{"content":"You use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> just as you would use an <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)]</ph> <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection&gt;</ph>.","pos":[550,730],"source":" You use the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> just as you would use an [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection>."},{"content":"In fact, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> is initialized with a connection or connection string that you supply.","pos":[731,850],"source":" In fact, the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is initialized with a connection or connection string that you supply."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>DataContext Methods (O/R Designer)<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/data-tools/datacontext-methods-o-r-designer)</ept>.","pos":[851,973],"source":" For more information, see [DataContext Methods (O/R Designer)](/visualstudio/data-tools/datacontext-methods-o-r-designer)."},{"content":"The purpose of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> is to translate your requests for objects into SQL queries to be made against the database, and then to assemble objects out of the results.","pos":[980,1175],"source":"The purpose of the <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> is to translate your requests for objects into SQL queries to be made against the database, and then to assemble objects out of the results."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext&gt;</ph> enables <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)]</ph> by implementing the same operator pattern as the Standard Query Operators, such as <ph id=\"ph3\">`Where`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">`Select`</ph>.","pos":[1176,1400],"source":" The <xref:System.Data.Linq.DataContext> enables [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../../../../../../includes/vbteclinqext-md.md)] by implementing the same operator pattern as the Standard Query Operators, such as `Where` and `Select`."},{"pos":[1408,1620],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n Maintaining a secure connection is of the highest importance.
