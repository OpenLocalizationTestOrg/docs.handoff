The validation checks if the name contains characters that are not allowed by the file system.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-vb[VbVbcnRegEx#4](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnRegEx/VB/Class1.vb#4)]  \n  \n This example does not check if the name has incorrectly placed colons, or directories with no name, or if the length of the name exceeds the system-defined maximum length. It also does not check if the application has permission to access the file-system resource with the specified name.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO.Path.GetInvalidPathChars%2A>\n- [Validating Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,317],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"file names [Visual Basic], validating\"\n  - \"strings [Visual Basic], validating\"\n  - \"Boolean values [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"paths [Visual Basic], validating\"\nms.assetid: f673462d-57b7-4120-b13a-6a7592f7ab2c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[324,377],"content":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","linkify":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Validate File Names and Paths in Visual Basic","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"This example returns a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Boolean`</ph> value that indicates whether a string represents a file name or path.","pos":[378,480],"source":"This example returns a `Boolean` value that indicates whether a string represents a file name or path."},{"content":"The validation checks if the name contains characters that are not allowed by the file system.","pos":[481,575]},{"pos":[584,591],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This example does not check if the name has incorrectly placed colons, or directories with no name, or if the length of the name exceeds the system-defined maximum length.","pos":[707,878]},{"content":"It also does not check if the application has permission to access the file-system resource with the specified name.","pos":[879,995]},{"pos":[1004,1012],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1063,1191],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Validating Strings in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)</ept>","source":"[Validating Strings in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/validating-strings.md)"}]}
