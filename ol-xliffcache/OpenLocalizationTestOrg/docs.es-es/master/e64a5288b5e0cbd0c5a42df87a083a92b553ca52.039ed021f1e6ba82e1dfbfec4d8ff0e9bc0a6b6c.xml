Either you have a redundant `End Try` statement, or your `End Try` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30383  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Locate and remove the unnecessary `End Try`.  \n  \n2.  Move the `End Try` to the appropriate location in your code.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,207],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30383\"\n  - \"vbc30383\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30383\"\nms.assetid: 1d13357a-ab44-4082-b204-6e2e94f4774e","nodes":[{"content":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,46],"content":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","nodes":[{"content":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","pos":[0,46]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[214,260],"content":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","linkify":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","nodes":[{"content":"'End Try' must be preceded by a matching 'Try'","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`End Try`</ph> is used to complete a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Try`</ph> block, and hence it can only appear at the end of the block.","pos":[261,359],"source":"`End Try` is used to complete a `Try` block, and hence it can only appear at the end of the block."},{"content":"Either you have a redundant <ph id=\"ph1\">`End Try`</ph> statement, or your <ph id=\"ph2\">`End Try`</ph> statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding <ph id=\"ph3\">`Try`</ph> block.","pos":[360,497],"source":" Either you have a redundant `End Try` statement, or your `End Try` statement appears outside the bounds of its corresponding `Try` block."},{"pos":[504,525],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30383","source":"**Error ID:** BC30383"},{"pos":[534,555],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[565,609],"content":"Locate and remove the unnecessary <ph id=\"ph1\">`End Try`</ph>.","source":"Locate and remove the unnecessary `End Try`."},{"pos":[619,679],"content":"Move the <ph id=\"ph1\">`End Try`</ph> to the appropriate location in your code.","source":"Move the `End Try` to the appropriate location in your code."},{"pos":[688,696],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[700,814],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Try...Catch...Finally Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)"}]}
