The specifications use XML, SOAP, and Web Services Description Language (WSDL) to provide mechanisms that enable authentication and authorization across different trust realms.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Federation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation.md)  \n Provides an overview of federation.  \n  \n [Federation and Trust](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-trust.md)  \n Lists the design issues to be aware of when creating federated services or clients.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Federated Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-federated-client.md)  \n Describes the basics of creating a federated client with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Configure Credentials on a Federation Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-credentials-on-a-federation-service.md)  \n Describes the steps of creating a federated service.  \n  \n [How to: Create a WSFederationHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-wsfederationhttpbinding.md)  \n Describes how to configure clients and services that use the `WSFederationHttpBinding`.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Security Token Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-security-token-service.md)  \n Describes the steps of creating a security token service.  \n  \n [Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) Tokens and Claims](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/saml-tokens-and-claims.md)  \n Describes Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML) tokens, which are extensible and enable you to create rich claim types.  \n  \n [How to: Configure a Local Issuer](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-configure-a-local-issuer.md)  \n Describes how to create a local issuer of security tokens.  \n  \n [How to: Disable Secure Sessions on a WSFederationHttpBinding](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-disable-secure-sessions-on-a-wsfederationhttpbinding.md)  \n Describes how to disable secure sessions on a `WSFederationHttpBinding`.
