This example shows how to use the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to log tracing information.\n\nFor logging exception information, use the `My.Application.Log.WriteException` method; see [How to: Log Exceptions](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/how-to-log-exceptions.md).\n\n## Example\n\nThis example uses the `My.Application.Log.WriteEntry` method to write out the trace information.\n\n[!code-vb[VbVbalrMyApplicationLog#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyApplicationLog/VB/Form1.vb#11)]\n\n## .NET Framework Security\n\nMake sure the data you write to the log does not include sensitive information such as user passwords.
