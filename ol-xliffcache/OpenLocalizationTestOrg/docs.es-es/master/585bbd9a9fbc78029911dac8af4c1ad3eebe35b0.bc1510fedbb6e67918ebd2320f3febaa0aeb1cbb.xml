LINQ documentation and samples.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Introduction to LINQ Queries (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/introduction-to-linq-queries.md)  \n Describes the three parts of the basic LINQ query operation that are common across all languages and data sources.  \n  \n [LINQ and Generic Types (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-and-generic-types.md)  \n Provides a brief introduction to generic types as they are used in LINQ.  \n  \n [Basic LINQ Query Operations](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-linq-query-operations.md)  \n Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in C#.  \n  \n [Data Transformations with LINQ (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/data-transformations-with-linq.md)  \n Describes the various ways that you can transform data retrieved in queries.  \n  \n [Type Relationships in LINQ Query Operations](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-linq-query-operations.md)  \n Describes how types are preserved and/or transformed in the three parts of a LINQ query operation  \n  \n [Query Syntax and Method Syntax in LINQ](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/query-syntax-and-method-syntax-in-linq.md)  \n Compares method syntax and query syntax as two ways to express a LINQ query.  \n  \n [C# Features That Support LINQ](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/features-that-support-linq.md)  \n Describes the language constructs added in C# 3.0 that support LINQ.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in C#](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries-linq.md)  \n Step-by-step instructions for creating a C# LINQ project, adding a simple data source, and performing
