The following table describes when the <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> becomes involved during XSLT processing.  \n  \n|XSLT task|What the XmlResolver is used for|  \n|---------------|--------------------------------------|  \n|Compile the style sheet.|Resolve the URI of the style sheet.<br /><br /> -and-<br /><br /> Resolve URI references in any `xsl:import` or `xsl:include` elements.|  \n|Execute the style sheet.|Resolve the URI of the context document.<br /><br /> -and-<br /><br /> Resolve URI references in any XSLT `document()` functions.|  \n  \n The <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Load%2A> and <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform.Transform%2A> methods include overloads that take an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> object as one of its arguments. If an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> is not specified, a default <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> with no credentials is used.  \n  \n The following list describes when you may want to specify an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> object:  \n  \n-   If the XSLT process needs to access a network resource that requires authentication, you can use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> with the necessary credentials.  \n  \n-   If you want to restrict the resources that the XSLT process can access, you can use an <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> with the correct permission set. Use the <xref:System.Xml.XmlSecureResolver> class if you need to open a resource that you do not control, or that is untrusted.  \n  \n-   If you want to customize behavior, you can implement your own <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> class and use it to resolve resources.  \n  \n-   If you want to ensure that no external resources are accessed, you can specify `null` for the <xref:System.Xml.XmlResolver> argument.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example compiles a style sheet that is stored on a network resource. An <xref:System.Xml.XmlUrlResolver> object specifies the credentials necessary to access the style sheet.  \n  \n
