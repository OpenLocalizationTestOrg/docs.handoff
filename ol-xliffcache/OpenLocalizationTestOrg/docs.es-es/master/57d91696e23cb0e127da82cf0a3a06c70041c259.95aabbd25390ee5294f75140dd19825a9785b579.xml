This topic describes those steps and points you to specific topics for more information. To understand the channel model and the various types that are mentioned in this topic, see [Channel Model Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/channel-model-overview.md). For a complete transport channel sample, see [Transport: UDP](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/transport-udp.md).  \n  \n## The Channel Development Task List  \n The steps to create a user-defined channel are as follows. All channels must:  \n  \n1.  Decide which of the channel Message Exchange Patterns (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IOutputChannel>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IInputChannel>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IDuplexChannel>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IRequestChannel>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IReplyChannel>) your <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelFactory> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener> will support, as well as whether it will support the sessionful variations of these interfaces. For details, see [Choosing a Message Exchange Pattern](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/choosing-a-message-exchange-pattern.md).  \n  \n2.  Create a channel factory and listener (<xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelFactory> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.IChannelListener>) that support your message exchange pattern. For details about developing factories, see [Client: Channel Factories and Channels](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/client-channel-factories-and-channels.md). For details about developing listeners, see [Service: Channel Listeners and Channels](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/service-channel-listeners-and-channels.md).  \n  \n3.  Ensure that any network-specific exceptions are normalized to either <xref:System.TimeoutException?displayProperty=fullName> or the appropriate derived class of <xref:System.ServiceModel.CommunicationException>. For details, see [Handling Exceptions and Faults](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/handling-exceptions-and-faults.md).  \n  \n4.  To enable use from the application layer, add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement> that adds the custom channel to a channel stack. For more information, see [Creating a BindingElement](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/creating-a-bindingelement.md).  \n  \n The following additional steps are required to enable more complete support at the application layer:  \n  \n1.  Add a binding element extension section to expose the new binding element to the configuration system. For more information, see [Configuration and Metadata Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/configuration-and-metadata-support.md).  \n  \n2.  Add metadata extensions to communicate capabilities to other endpoints. For more information, see [Configuration and Metadata Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/configuration-and-metadata-support.md).  \n  \n3.  Add a binding that pre-configures a stack of binding elements according to a well-defined profile. For more information, see [Creating User-Defined Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/creating-user-defined-bindings.md).  \n  \n4.  Add a binding section and binding configuration element to expose the binding to the configuration system. For more information, see [Configuration and Metadata Support](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/configuration-and-metadata-support.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Extending
