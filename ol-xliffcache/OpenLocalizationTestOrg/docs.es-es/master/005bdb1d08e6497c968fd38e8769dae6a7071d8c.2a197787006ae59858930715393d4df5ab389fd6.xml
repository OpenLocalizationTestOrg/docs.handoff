In the current version, only COR_PUB_MANAGEDONLY is valid.  \n  \n `ppIEnum`  \n A pointer to the address of an [ICorPublishProcessEnum](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icorpublishprocessenum-interface.md) instance that is the enumerator of the processes.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The enumerator's collection of processes is based on a snapshot of the processes that are running when the `EnumProcesses` method is called. The enumerator will not include any processes that terminate before or start after `EnumProcesses` is called.  \n  \n The `EnumProcesses` method may be called more than once on this [ICorPublish](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icorpublish-interface.md) instance to create a new up-to-date collection of processes. Existing collections will not be affected by subsequent calls of the `EnumProcesses` method.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorPub.idl, CorPub.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:**
