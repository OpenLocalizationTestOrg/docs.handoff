However, two classes that work together cannot have mutual and redundant conversions, or no implicit conversions. The types of `class1` and `class2` are determined independently, and the more general type is selected as the type of the conditional expression. For more information about how types are determined, see [Conditional operator cannot cast implicitly](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=213999).  \n  \n To resolve CS0173, verify that there is one and only one implicit conversion between `class1` and `class2`, regardless of which direction the conversion is in and regardless of which class the conversion is in. For more information, see [Implicit Numeric Conversions Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/implicit-numeric-conversions-table.md) and [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0173:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0173.cs  \npublic class C {}  \n  \npublic class A   \n{  \n    //// The following code defines an implicit conversion operator from    \n    //// type C to type A.  \n    //public static implicit operator A(C c)  \n    //{  \n    //    A a = new A();  \n    //    a = c;  \n    //    return a;  \n    //}  \n}  \n  \npublic class MyClass  \n{  \n    public static void F(bool b)  \n    {  \n        A a = new A();  \n        C c = new C();  \n  \n        // The following line causes CS0173 because there is no implicit  \n        // conversion from a to c or from c to a.  \n        object o = b ? a : c;  \n  \n        // To resolve the error, you can cast a and c.  \n        //object o = b ? (object)a : (object)c;  \n  \n        // Alternatively, you can add a conversion operator from class C to  \n        // class A, or from class A to class C, but not both.  \n    }  \n  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n      F(true);  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code does not produce CS0173 in Visual Studio 2005, but does in later versions.  \n  \n```csharp  \n//cs0173_2.cs  \nclass M  \n{  \n    static int Main ()  \n    {  \n        int X = 1;  \n        // The following line causes CS0173 in Visual Studio 2005.  \n        object o = (X == 0) ? null : null;  \n        return -1;  \n    }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0173 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0173 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[543,564],"content":"Compiler Error CS0173","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0173","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0173","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Type of conditional expression cannot be determined because there is no implicit conversion between 'class1' and 'class2'","pos":[565,686]},{"content":"Conversions between classes are useful when you want objects of different classes to work with the same code.","pos":[693,802]},{"content":"However, two classes that work together cannot have mutual and redundant conversions, or no implicit conversions.","pos":[803,916]},{"content":"The types of <ph id=\"ph1\">`class1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`class2`</ph> are determined independently, and the more general type is selected as the type of the conditional expression.","pos":[917,1062],"source":" The types of `class1` and `class2` are determined independently, and the more general type is selected as the type of the conditional expression."},{"content":"For more information about how types are determined, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Conditional operator cannot cast implicitly<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=213999)</ept>.","pos":[1063,1213],"source":" For more information about how types are determined, see [Conditional operator cannot cast implicitly](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=213999)."},{"content":"To resolve CS0173, verify that there is one and only one implicit conversion between <ph id=\"ph1\">`class1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`class2`</ph>, regardless of which direction the conversion is in and regardless of which class the conversion is in.","pos":[1220,1430],"source":"To resolve CS0173, verify that there is one and only one implicit conversion between `class1` and `class2`, regardless of which direction the conversion is in and regardless of which class the conversion is in."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Implicit Numeric Conversions Table<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/implicit-numeric-conversions-table.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Conversion Operators<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md)</ept>.","pos":[1431,1696],"source":" For more information, see [Implicit Numeric Conversions Table](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/implicit-numeric-conversions-table.md) and [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md)."},{"pos":[1705,1712],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0173:","pos":[1716,1754]},{"pos":[2706,2713],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code does not produce CS0173 in Visual Studio 2005, but does in later versions.","pos":[2717,2810]}]}
