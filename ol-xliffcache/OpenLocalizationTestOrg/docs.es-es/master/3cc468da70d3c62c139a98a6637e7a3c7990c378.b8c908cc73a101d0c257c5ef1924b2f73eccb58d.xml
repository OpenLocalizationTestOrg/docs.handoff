In this case, the `TResult` of the enclosing task is itself a task. In the following example, the Result property is a `Task<Task<string>>` in C# or `Task(Of Task(Of String))` in Visual Basic.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPL_Unwrap#02](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#02)]\n [!code-vb[TPL_Unwrap#02](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippets1-3.vb#02)]  \n  \n Although it is possible to write code to unwrap the outer task and retrieve the original task and its <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task%601.Result%2A> property, such code is not easy to write because you must handle exceptions and also cancellation requests. In this situation, we recommend that you use one of the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> extension methods, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPL_UnWrap#03](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#03)]\n [!code-vb[TPL_UnWrap#03](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippets1-3.vb#03)]  \n  \n The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> methods can be used to transform any `Task<Task>` or `Task<Task<TResult>>` (`Task(Of Task)` or `Task(Of Task(Of TResult))` in Visual Basic) to a `Task` or `Task<TResult>` (`Task(Of TResult)` in Visual Basic). The new task fully represents the inner nested task, and includes cancellation state and all exceptions.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example demonstrates how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions.Unwrap%2A> extension methods.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPL_UnWrap#04](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/cs/unwrapprogram.cs#04)]\n [!code-vb[TPL_UnWrap#04](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpl_unwrap/vb/snippet04.vb#04)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.TaskExtensions?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Task-based Asynchronous Programming](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/task-based-asynchronous-programming.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,279],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Unwrap a Nested Task\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  -
