SKIP cannot be used separately from the ORDER BY clause.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \n  \n[ SKIP n ]  \n```  \n  \n## Arguments  \n `n`  \n The number of items to skip.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n If a SKIP expression sub-clause is present in an ORDER BY clause, the results will be sorted according the sort specification and the result set will include rows starting from the next row immediately after the SKIP expression. For example, SKIP 5 will skip the first five rows and return from the sixth row forward.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  An [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query is invalid if both the TOP modifier and the SKIP sub-clause are present in the same query expression. The query should be rewritten by changing the TOP expression to the LIMIT expression.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../../../../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)], using SKIP with ORDER BY on non-key columns might return incorrect results. More than the specified number of rows might be skipped if the non-key column has duplicate data in it. This is due to how SKIP is translated for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../../../../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)]. For example, in the following code more than five rows might be skipped if `E.NonKeyColumn` has duplicate values:  \n>   \n>  `SELECT [E] FROM Container.EntitySet AS [E] ORDER BY [E].[NonKeyColumn] DESC SKIP 5L`  \n  \n The  [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query in [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb738702\\(v=vs.100\\).aspx#_ESQL) example uses the ORDER BY operator with SKIP to specify the sort order used on objects returned in a SELECT statement.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ORDER BY](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/order-by-entity-sql.md)   \n [How to: Page Through Query Results](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ffc0f920-e7de-42e0-9b12-ef356421d030)   \n [Paging](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/paging-entity-sql.md)   \n [TOP](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/top-entity-sql.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,46],"content":"SKIP (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"SKIP (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,34]}]},{"pos":[410,427],"content":"SKIP (Entity SQL)","linkify":"SKIP (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"SKIP (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"You can perform physical paging by using the SKIP sub-clause in the ORDER BY clause.","pos":[428,512]},{"content":"SKIP cannot be used separately from the ORDER BY clause.","pos":[513,569]},{"pos":[578,584],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[624,633],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"The number of items to skip.","pos":[644,672]},{"pos":[681,688],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"If a SKIP expression sub-clause is present in an ORDER BY clause, the results will be sorted according the sort specification and the result set will include rows starting from the next row immediately after the SKIP expression.","pos":[692,920]},{"content":"For example, SKIP 5 will skip the first five rows and return from the sixth row forward.","pos":[921,1009]},{"pos":[1017,1280],"content":"[!NOTE]\n An [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query is invalid if both the TOP modifier and the SKIP sub-clause are present in the same query expression.
