On a 64-bit machine, the profiled process's bitness must match the bitness of the trigger process that is calling `AttachProfiler`. If the user account under which `AttachProfiler` is called has administrative privileges, the target process may be any process on the system. Otherwise, the target process must be owned by the same user account.  \n  \n `dwMillisecondsMax`  \n [in] The time duration, in milliseconds, for `AttachProfiler` to complete. The trigger process should pass a timeout that is known to be sufficient for the particular profiler to complete its initialization.  \n  \n `pClsidProfiler`  \n [in] A pointer to the CLSID of the profiler to be loaded. The trigger process can reuse this memory after `AttachProfiler` returns.  \n  \n `wszProfilerPath`  \n [in] The full path to the profiler’s DLL file to be loaded. This string should contain no more than 260 characters, including the null terminator. If `wszProfilerPath` is null or an empty string, the common language runtime (CLR) will try to find the location of the profiler’s DLL file by looking in the registry for the CLSID that `pClsidProfiler` points to.  \n  \n `pvClientData`  \n [in] A pointer to data to be passed to the profiler by the [ICorProfilerCallback3::InitializeForAttach](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback3-initializeforattach-method.md) method. The trigger process can reuse this memory after `AttachProfiler` returns. If `pvClientData` is null, `cbClientData` must be 0 (zero).  \n  \n `cbClientData`  \n [in] The size, in bytes, of the data that `pvClientData` points to.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n This method returns the following HRESULTs.  \n  \n|HRESULT|Description|  \n|-------------|-----------------|  \n|S_OK|The specified profiler has successfully attached to the target process.|  \n|CORPROF_E_PROFILER_ALREADY_ACTIVE|There is already a profiler active or attaching to the target process.|  \n|CORPROF_E_PROFILER_NOT_ATTACHABLE|The specified profiler does not support attachment. The trigger process may attempt to attach a different profiler.|  \n|CORPROF_E_PROFILEE_INCOMPATIBLE_WITH_TRIGGER|Unable to request a profiler attachment, because the version of the target process is incompatible with the current process that is calling `AttachProfiler`.|  \n|HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED)|The user of the trigger process does not have access to the target process.|  \n|HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_PRIVILEGE_NOT_HELD)|The user of the trigger process does not have the privileges necessary to attach a profiler to the given target process. The application event log may contain more information.|  \n|CORPROF_E_IPC_FAILED|A failure occurred when communicating with the target process. This commonly happens if the target process was shutting down.|  \n|HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)|The target process does not exist or is not running a CLR that supports attachment. This may indicate that the CLR was unloaded since the call to the runtime enumeration method.|  \n|HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_TIMEOUT)|The timeout expired without beginning to load the profiler. You can retry the attach operation. Timeouts occur when a finalizer in the target process runs for a longer time than the timeout value.|  \n|E_INVALIDARG|One or more parameters have invalid values.|  \n|E_FAIL|Some other, unspecified failure occurred.|  \n|Other error codes|If the profiler’s [ICorProfilerCallback3::InitializeForAttach](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/profiling/icorprofilercallback3-initializeforattach-method.md) method returns an HRESULT that indicates failure, `AttachProfiler` returns that same HRESULT. In this case, E_NOTIMPL is converted to CORPROF_E_PROFILER_NOT_ATTACHABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n  \n## Memory Management  \n In keeping with COM conventions, the caller of `AttachProfiler` (for example, the trigger code authored by the profiler developer) is responsible for allocating and de-allocating the memory for the data that the `pvClientData` parameter points to. When the CLR executes the `AttachProfiler` call, it makes a copy of the memory that `pvClientData` points to and transmits it to the target process. When the CLR inside the target process receives its own copy of the `pvClientData` block, it passes the block to the profiler through the `InitializeForAttach` method, and then deallocates its copy of the `pvClientData` block from the target process.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n
