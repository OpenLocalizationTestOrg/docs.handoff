{"content":"---\ntitle: \"Expressions1\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: c42341a9-43a1-462c-bffb-c5de004aa428\n---\n# Expressions\nA Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) expression is any activity that returns a result. All expression activities derive indirectly from <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601>, which contains an <xref:System.Activities.OutArgument> property named <xref:System.Activities.Activity%601.Result%2A> as the activity’s return value. [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] ships with a wide range of expression activities from simple ones like <xref:System.Activities.Expressions.VariableValue%601> and <xref:System.Activities.Expressions.VariableReference%601>, which provide access to single workflow variable through operator activities, to complex activities such as <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities.VisualBasicReference%601> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities.VisualBasicValue%601> that offer access to the full breadth of Visual Basic language to produce the result. Additional expression activities can be created by deriving from <xref:System.Activities.CodeActivity%601> or <xref:System.Activities.NativeActivity%601>.  \n  \n## Using Expressions  \n Workflow designer uses <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities.VisualBasicValue%601> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Activities.VisualBasicReference%601> for all expressions in Visual Basic projects, and <xref:Microsoft.CSharp.Activities.CSharpValue%601> and <xref:Microsoft.CSharp.Activities.CSharpReference%601> for expressions in C# workflow projects.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Support for C# expressions in workflow projects was introduced in [!INCLUDE[net_v45](../../../includes/net-v45-md.md)]. For more information, see [C# Expressions](csharp-expressions.md).  \n  \n Workflows produced by designer are saved in XAML, where expressions appear enclosed in square brackets, as in the following example.  \n  \n```xml  \n<Sequence xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/netfx/2009/xaml/activities\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\">  \n  <Sequence.Variables>  \n    <Variable x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\" Default=\"1\" Name=\"a\" />  \n    <Variable x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\" Default=\"2\" Name=\"b\" />  \n    <Variable x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\" Default=\"3\" Name=\"c\" />  \n    <Variable x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\" Default=\"0\" Name=\"r\" />  \n  </Sequence.Variables>  \n  <Assign>  \n    <Assign.To>  \n      <OutArgument x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\">[r]</OutArgument>  \n    </Assign.To>  \n    <Assign.Value>  \n      <InArgument x:TypeArguments=\"x:Int32\">[a + b + c]</InArgument>  \n    </Assign.Value>  \n  </Assign>  \n</Sequence>  \n```  \n  \n When defining a workflow in code, any expression activities can be used. The following example shows the usage of a composition of operator activities to add three numbers.  \n  \n```  \nVariable<int> a = new Variable<int>(\"a\", 1);  \nVariable<int> b = new Variable<int>(\"b\", 2);  \nVariable<int> c = new Variable<int>(\"c\", 3);  \nVariable<int> r = new Variable<int>(\"r\", 0);  \n  \nSequence w = new Sequence  \n{  \n    Variables = { a, b, c, r },  \n    Activities =   \n    {  \n        new Assign {  \n            To = new OutArgument<int>(r),  \n            Value = new InArgument<int> {  \n                Expression = new Add<int, int, int> {  \n                    Left = new Add<int, int, int> {  \n                        Left = new InArgument<int>(a),  \n                        Right = new InArgument<int>(b)  \n                    },  \n                    Right = new InArgument<int>(c)  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n```  \n  \n The same workflow can be expressed more compactly by using C# lambda expressions, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```  \nVariable<int> a = new Variable<int>(\"a\", 1);  \nVariable<int> b = new Variable<int>(\"b\", 2);  \nVariable<int> c = new Variable<int>(\"c\", 3);  \nVariable<int> r = new Variable<int>(\"r\", 0);  \n  \nSequence w = new Sequence  \n{  \n    Variables = { a, b, c, r },  \n    Activities =   \n    {  \n        new Assign {  \n            To = new OutArgument<int>(r),  \n            Value = new InArgument<int>((ctx) => a.Get(ctx) + b.Get(ctx) + c.Get(ctx))  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n```  \n  \n The workflow can also be expressed by using Visual Basic expression activities, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```  \nVariable<int> a = new Variable<int>(\"a\", 1);  \nVariable<int> b = new Variable<int>(\"b\", 2);  \nVariable<int> c = new Variable<int>(\"c\", 3);  \nVariable<int> r = new Variable<int>(\"r\", 0);  \n  \nSequence w = new Sequence  \n{  \n    Variables = { a, b, c, r },  \n    Activities =   \n    {  \n        new Assign {  \n            To = new OutArgument<int>(r),  \n            Value = new InArgument<int>(new VisualBasicValue<int>(\"a + b + c\"))  \n        }  \n    }  \n};  \n```  \n  \n## Extending Available Expressions with Custom Expression Activities  \n Expressions in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_short](../../../includes/netfx-current-short-md.md)] are extensible allowing for additional expression activities to be created. The following example shows an activity that returns a sum of three integer values.  \n  \n```  \nusing System;  \nusing System.Collections.Generic;  \nusing System.Linq;  \nusing System.Text;  \nusing System.Activities;  \n  \nnamespace ExpressionsDemo  \n{  \n    public sealed class AddThreeValues : CodeActivity<int>  \n    {  \n        public InArgument<int> Value1 { get; set; }  \n        public InArgument<int> Value2 { get; set; }  \n        public InArgument<int> Value3 { get; set; }  \n  \n        protected override int Execute(CodeActivityContext context)  \n        {  \n            return Value1.Get(context) +   \n                   Value2.Get(context) +   \n                   Value3.Get(context);  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n With this new activity you can rewrite the previous workflow that added three values as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```  \nVariable<int> a = new Variable<int>(\"a\", 1);  \nVariable<int> b = new Variable<int>(\"b\", 2);  \nVariable<int> c = new Variable<int>(\"c\", 3);  \nVariable<int> r = new Variable<int>(\"r\", 0);  \n  \nSequence w = new Sequence  \n{  \n    Variables = { a, b, c, r },  \n    Activities =   \n    {  \n        new Assign {  \n            To = new OutArgument<int>(r),  \n            Value = new InArgument<int> {  \n                Expression = new AddThreeValues() {  \n                    Value1 = new InArgument<int>(a),  \n                    Value2 = new InArgument<int>(b),  \n                    Value3 = new InArgument<int>(c)  \n                }  \n            }  \n        }  \n    }  \n};
