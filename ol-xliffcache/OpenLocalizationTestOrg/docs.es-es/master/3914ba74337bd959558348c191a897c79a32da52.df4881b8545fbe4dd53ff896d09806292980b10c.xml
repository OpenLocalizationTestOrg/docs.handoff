Creating <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601> instances incurs some overhead because it involves the following operations:  \n  \n-   Constructing the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ContractDescription> tree  \n  \n-   Reflecting all of the required CLR types  \n  \n-   Constructing the channel stack  \n  \n-   Disposing of resources  \n  \n To help minimize this overhead, WCF can cache channel factories when you are using a WCF client proxy.  \n  \n> [!TIP]\n>  You have direct control over channel factory creation when you use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ChannelFactory%601> class directly.  \n  \n WCF client proxies generated with [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) are derived from <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601>. <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> defines a static <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting%2A> property that defines channel factory caching behavior. Cache settings are made for a specific type. For example, setting  `ClientBase<ITest>.CacheSettings` to one of the values defined below will affect only those proxy/ClientBase of type `ITest`. The cache setting for a particular <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> is immutable as soon as the first proxy/ClientBase instance is created.  \n  \n## Specifying Caching Behavior  \n Caching behavior is specified by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting> property to one of the following values.  \n  \n|Cache Setting Value|Description|  \n|-------------------------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.AlwaysOn>|All instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> within the app-domain can participate in caching. The developer has determined that there are no adverse security implications to caching. Caching will not be turned off even if \"security-sensitive\" properties on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> are accessed. The \"security-sensitive\" properties of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> are <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.ClientCredentials%2A>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.Endpoint%2A> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.ChannelFactory%2A>.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.Default>|Only instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> created from endpoints defined in configuration files participate in caching within the app-domain. Any instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> created programmatically within that app-domain will not participate in caching. Also, caching will be disabled for an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> once any of its \"security-sensitive\" properties is accessed.|  \n|<xref:System.ServiceModel.CacheSetting.AlwaysOff>|Caching is turned off for all instances of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601> of a particular type within the app-domain in question.|  \n  \n The following code snippets illustrate how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601.CacheSetting%2A> property.  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass Program   \n{   \n   static void Main(string[] args)   \n   {   \n      ClientBase<ITest>.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.AlwaysOn;   \n      foreach (string msg in messages)   \n      {   \n         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient (new BasicHttpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(address)))   \n         {   \n            // ...  \n            proxy.Test(msg);   \n            // ...  \n         }   \n      }   \n   }   \n}  \n// Generated by SvcUtil.exe     \npublic partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest { }  \n```  \n  \n In the above code, all instances of `TestClient` will use the same channel factory.  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass Program   \n{   \n   static void Main(string[] args)   \n   {   \n      ClientBase.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.Default;   \n      int i = 1;   \n      foreach (string msg in messages)   \n      {   \n         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient (\"MyEndpoint\", new EndpointAddress(address)))   \n         {   \n            if (i == 4)   \n            {   \n               ServiceEndpoint endpoint = proxy.Endpoint;   \n               ... // use endpoint in some way   \n            }   \n            proxy.Test(msg);   \n         }   \n         i++;   \n   }   \n}   \n  \n// Generated by SvcUtil.exe     \npublic partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest {}  \n```  \n  \n In the example above, all instances of `TestClient` would use the same channel factory except instance #4. Instance #4 would use a channel factory that is created specifically for its use. This setting would work for scenarios where a particular endpoint needs different security settings from the other endpoints of the same channel factory type (in this case `ITest`).  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass Program   \n{   \n   static void Main(string[] args)   \n   {   \n      ClientBase.CacheSettings = CacheSettings.AlwaysOff;   \n      foreach (string msg in messages)   \n      {   \n         using (TestClient proxy = new TestClient (\"MyEndpoint\", new EndpointAddress(address)))   \n         {   \n            proxy.Test(msg);   \n         }           \n      }   \n   }  \n}  \n  \n// Generated by SvcUtil.exe   \npublic partial class TestClient : System.ServiceModel.ClientBase, ITest {}  \n```  \n  \n In the example above, all instances of `TestClient` would use different channel factories. This is useful when each endpoint has different security requirements and it makes no sense to cache.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase%601>\n- [Building
