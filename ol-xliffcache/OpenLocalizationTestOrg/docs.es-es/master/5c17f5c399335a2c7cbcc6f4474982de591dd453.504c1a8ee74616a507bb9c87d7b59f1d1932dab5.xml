There are two ways to specify how a service should publish metadata, using a configuration file and using code. This topic shows how to publish metadata for a service using a code.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  This topic shows how to publish metadata in an unsecure manner. Any client can retrieve the metadata from the service. If you require your service to publish metadata in a secure manner. see [Custom Secure Metadata Endpoint](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/custom-secure-metadata-endpoint.md).  \n  \n For more information about publishing metadata in a configuration file, see [How to: Publish Metadata for a Service Using a Configuration File](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-publish-metadata-for-a-service-using-a-configuration-file.md). Publishing metadata allows clients to retrieve the metadata using a WS-Transfer GET request or an HTTP/GET request using the `?wsdl` query string. To be sure that the code is working you must create a basic WCF service. A basic self-hosted service is provided in the following code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[htPublishMetadataCode#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/cs/program.cs#0)]\n [!code-vb[htPublishMetadataCode#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htpublishmetadatacode/vb/program.vb#0)]  \n  \n### To publish metadata in code  \n  \n1.
