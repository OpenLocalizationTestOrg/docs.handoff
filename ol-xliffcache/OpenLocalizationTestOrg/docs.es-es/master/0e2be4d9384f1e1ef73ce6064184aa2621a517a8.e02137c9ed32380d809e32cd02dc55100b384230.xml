In the .NET Framework 4, concurrent garbage collection was replaced by background GC, which also performs garbage collection in the background on a separate thread. Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5, background collection became available in server garbage collection. The `<gcConcurrent>` element controls whether the runtime performs either concurrent or background garbage collection, if it's available, or whether it performs garbage collection in the foreground.\n\n### To disable background garbage collection\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Starting with the .NET Framework 4, concurrent garbage collection is replaced by background garbage collection. The terms *concurrent* and *background* are used interchangeably in the .NET Framework documentation. To disable background garbage collection, use the `<gcConcurrent>` element, as discussed in this article.\n\nBy default, the runtime uses concurrent or background garbage collection, which is optimized for latency. If your application involves heavy user interaction, leave concurrent garbage collection enabled to minimize the application's pause time to perform garbage collection. If you set the `enabled` attribute of the `<gcConcurrent>` element to `false`, the runtime uses non-concurrent garbage collection, which is optimized for throughput. The following configuration file disables background garbage collection.\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n   <runtime>\n      <gcConcurrent enabled=\"false\"/>\n   </runtime>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n If there's a `<gcConcurrentSetting>` setting in the machine configuration file, it defines the default value for all .NET Framework applications. The machine configuration file setting overrides the application configuration file setting.\n\n For more information on concurrent and background garbage collection, see the [Concurrent garbage collection](../../../../standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals.md#concurrent-garbage-collection) section in the [Fundamentals of Garbage Collection](../../../../standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals.md) article.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example enables concurrent garbage collection:\n\n```xml\n<configuration>\n   <runtime>\n      <gcConcurrent enabled=\"true\"/>\n   </runtime>\n</configuration>\n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [Runtime Settings Schema](index.md)\n- [Configuration File Schema](../index.md)\n- [Fundamentals of Garbage Collection](../../../../standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,447],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"<gcConcurrent> Element\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0#configuration/runtime/gcConcurrent\"\n  - \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/.NetConfiguration/v2.0#gcConcurrent\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"container tags, <gcConcurrent> element\"\n  - \"gcConcurrent element\"\n  - \"<gcConcurrent> element\"\nms.assetid: 503f55ba-26ed-45ac-a2ea-caf994da04cd\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"<gcConcurrent> Element","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;gcConcurrent&gt;</ph> Element","source":"<gcConcurrent> Element"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[454,477],"content":"\\<gcConcurrent> Element","linkify":"\\<gcConcurrent> Element","nodes":[{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>gcConcurrent&gt;
