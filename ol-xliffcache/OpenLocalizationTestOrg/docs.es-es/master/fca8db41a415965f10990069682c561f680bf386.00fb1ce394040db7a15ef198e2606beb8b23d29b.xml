See the [Participating in Persistence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=177735) sample and [Store Extensibility](store-extensibility.md) topic for sample implementations of persistence participants.  \n  \n1.  Create a class deriving from the <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant> or the <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceIOParticipant> class. The PersistenceIOParticipant class offers the same extensibility points as the PersistenceParticipant class in addition to being able to participate in I/O operations. Follow one or more of the following steps.  \n  \n2.  Implement the <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant.CollectValues%2A> method. The **CollectValues** method has two dictionary parameters, one for storing read/write values and the other one for storing write-only values (used later in queries). In this method, you should populate these dictionaries with data that is specific to a persistence participant. Each dictionary contains the name of the value as the key and the value itself as an <xref:System.Runtime.DurableInstancing.InstanceValue> object.  \n  \n     The values in the readWriteValues dictionary are packaged as **InstanceValue** objects. The values in the write-only dictionary are packaged as **InstanceValue** objects with InstanceValueOptions.Optional and InstanceValueOption.WriteOnly set. Each **InstanceValue** provided by the **CollectValues** implementations across all persistence participants must have a unique name.  \n  \n    ```  \n    protected virtual void CollectValues (out IDictionary<XName,Object> readWriteValues, out IDictionary<XName,Object> writeOnlyValues)  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Implement the <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant.MapValues%2A> method. The **MapValues** method takes two parameters that are similar to the parameters that the **CollectValues** method receives. All the values collected in the **CollectValues** stage are passed through these dictionary parameters. The new values added by the **MapValues** stage are added to the write-only values.  The write-only dictionary is used to provide data to an external source not directly associated with the instance values. Each value provided by implementations of the **MapValues** method across all persistence participants must have a unique name.  \n  \n    ```  \n    protected virtual IDictionary<XName,Object> MapValues (IDictionary<XName,Object> readWriteValues,IDictionary<XName,Object> writeOnlyValues)  \n    ```  \n  \n     The <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant.MapValues%2A> method provides functionality that <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant.CollectValues%2A> does not, in that it allows for a dependency on another value provided by another persistence participant that hasnâ€™t been processed by <xref:System.Activities.Persistence.PersistenceParticipant.CollectValues%2A> yet.  \n  \n4.  Implement the **PublishValues** method. The **PublishValues** method receives a dictionary containing all the values loaded from the persistence store.  \n  \n    ```  \n    protected virtual void PublishValues (IDictionary<XName,Object> readWriteValues)  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Implement the **BeginOnSave** method if the participant is a persistence I/O participant. This method is called during a Save operation. In this method, you should perform I/O adjunct to the persisting (saving) workflow instances.  If the host is using a transaction for the corresponding persistence command, the same transaction is provided in Transaction.Current.  Additionally, PersistenceIOParticipants may advertise a transactional consistency requirement, in which case the host creates a transaction for the persistence episode if one would not otherwise be used.  \n  \n    ```  \n    protected virtual IAsyncResult BeginOnSave (IDictionary<XName,Object> readWriteValues, IDictionary<XName,Object> writeOnlyValues, TimeSpan timeout, AsyncCallback callback, Object state)  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Implement the **BeginOnLoad** method if the participant is a persistence I/O participant. This method is called during a Load operation. In this method, you should perform I/O adjunct to the loading of workflow instances. If the host is using a transaction for the corresponding persistence command, the same transaction is provided in Transaction.Current. Additionally, Persistence I/O participants may advertise a transactional consistency requirement, in which case the host creates a transaction for the persistence episode if one would not otherwise be used.  \n  \n    ```  \n    protected virtual IAsyncResult BeginOnLoad (IDictionary<XName,Object> readWriteValues, TimeSpan timeout, AsyncCallback callback, Object state)  \n
