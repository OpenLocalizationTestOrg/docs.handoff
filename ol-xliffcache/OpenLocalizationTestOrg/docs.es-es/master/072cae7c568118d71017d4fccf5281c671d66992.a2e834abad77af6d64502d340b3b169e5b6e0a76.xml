Rows, and Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control\nThis section provides topics that demonstrate various programming tasks involving cell, row, and column objects.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Add ToolTips to Individual Cells in a Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/add-tooltips-to-individual-cells-in-a-wf-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellFormatting> event to provide different ToolTips for individual cells.  \n  \n [How to: Perform a Custom Action Based on Changes in a Cell of a Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/perform-a-custom-action-based-on-changes-in-a-cell-of-a-datagrid.md)  \n Describes how to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellValueChanged> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellStateChanged> events.  \n  \n [How to: Manipulate Bands in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-manipulate-bands-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to program with objects of type <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewBand>, which is the base type for rows and columns.  \n  \n [How to: Manipulate Rows in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-manipulate-rows-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to program with objects of type `DataGridViewRow`.  \n  \n [How to: Manipulate Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-manipulate-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to program with objects of type `DataGridViewColumn`.  \n  \n [How to: Work with Image Columns in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-work-with-image-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md)  \n Describes how to program with the `DataGridViewImageColumn` class.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n
