It's implemented as an [MSBuild target](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets), so the project is evaluated when the command is run. Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned. Both intermediate (*obj*) and final output (*bin*) folders are cleaned.\n\n## Arguments\n\n`PROJECT`\n\nThe MSBuild project to clean. If a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in *proj* and uses that file.\n\n## Options\n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`-o|--output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>`\n\nDirectory in which the build outputs are placed. Specify the `-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>` switch with the output directory switch if you specified the framework when the project was built.\n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nThe [framework](../../standard/frameworks.md) that was specified at build time. The framework must be defined in the [project file](csproj.md). If you specified the framework at build time, you must specify the framework when cleaning.\n\n`-c|--configuration <CONFIGURATION>`\n\nDefines the configuration. If omitted, it defaults to `Debug`. This property is only required when cleaning if you specified it during build time.\n\n`-v|--verbosity <LEVEL>`\n\nSets the verbosity level of the command. Allowed levels are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].\n\n## Examples\n\nClean a default build of the project:\n\n`dotnet clean`\n\nClean a project built using the Release configuration:\n\n`dotnet clean --configuration Release`\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,64],"content":"dotnet-clean command - .NET Core CLI | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-clean command - .NET Core CLI | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,53]}]},{"pos":[78,132],"content":"The dotnet-clean command cleans the current directory.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"The dotnet-clean command cleans the current directory.","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[143,184],"content":"dotnet-clean, CLI, CLI command, .NET Core","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-clean, CLI, CLI command, .NET Core","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[380,392],"content":"dotnet-clean","linkify":"dotnet-clean","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-clean","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[397,401],"content":"Name","linkify":"Name","nodes":[{"content":"Name","pos":[0,4]}]},{"pos":[403,451],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet-clean`</ph> - Cleans the output of a project.","source":"`dotnet-clean` - Cleans the output of a project."},{"pos":[457,465],"content":"Synopsis","linkify":"Synopsis","nodes":[{"content":"Synopsis","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[579,590],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet clean`</ph> command cleans the output of the previous build.","pos":[592,659],"source":"The `dotnet clean` command cleans the output of the previous build."},{"content":"It's implemented as an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>MSBuild target<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets)</ept>, so the project is evaluated when the command is run.","pos":[660,818],"source":" It's implemented as an [MSBuild target](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets), so the project is evaluated when the command is run."},{"content":"Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned.","pos":[819,873]},{"content":"Both intermediate (<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>obj<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>) and final output (<bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>bin<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept>) folders are cleaned.","pos":[874,945],"source":" Both intermediate (*obj*) and final output (*bin*) folders are cleaned."},{"pos":[950,959],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"The MSBuild project to clean.","pos":[972,1001]},{"content":"If a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>proj<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> and uses that file.","pos":[1002,1161],"source":" If a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file that has a file extension that ends in *proj* and uses that file."},{"pos":[1166,1173],"content":"Options","linkify":"Options","nodes":[{"content":"Options","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Prints out a short help for the command.","pos":[1188,1228]},{"content":"Directory in which the build outputs are placed.","pos":[1264,1312]},{"content":"Specify the <ph id=\"ph1\">`-f|--framework &lt;FRAMEWORK&gt;`</ph> switch with the output directory switch if you specified the framework when the project was built.","pos":[1313,1452],"source":" Specify the `-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>` switch with the output directory switch if you specified the framework when the project was built."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>framework<ept id=\"p1\">](../../standard/frameworks.md)</ept> that was specified at build time.","pos":[1484,1563],"source":"The [framework](../../standard/frameworks.md) that was specified at build time."},{"content":"The framework must be defined in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>project file<ept id=\"p1\">](csproj.md)</ept>.","pos":[1564,1627],"source":" The framework must be defined in the [project file](csproj.md)."},{"content":"If you specified the framework at build time, you must specify the framework when cleaning.","pos":[1628,1719]},{"content":"Defines the configuration.","pos":[1759,1785]},{"content":"If omitted, it defaults to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Debug`</ph>.","pos":[1786,1821],"source":" If omitted, it defaults to `Debug`."},{"content":"This property is only required when cleaning if you specified it during build time.","pos":[1822,1905]},{"content":"Sets the verbosity level of the command.","pos":[1933,1973]},{"content":"Allowed levels are q[uiet], m[inimal], n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic].","pos":[1974,2052]},{"pos":[2057,2065],"content":"Examples","linkify":"Examples","nodes":[{"content":"Examples","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Clean a default build of the project:","pos":[2067,2104]},{"content":"Clean a project built using the Release configuration:","pos":[2122,2176]}]}
