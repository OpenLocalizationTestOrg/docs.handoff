The Entity Framework 5.0 is not part of the .NET Framework, but is built on .NET Framework 4.5. The Entity Framework 5.0 is available as the [‘Entity Framework’](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=215714)[NuGet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=232488) package.

Entity types may have scalar, complex, and navigation properties. Objects are instances of entity types. For more information, see [Working with Objects](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/working-with-objects.md).|  \n|EntityType|The specification for a data type that includes a key and a named set of properties and represents a top-level item in a conceptual model or storage model.<br /><br /> For more information, see [EntityType Element (CSDL)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/19562e9f-fd70-4b59-bc15-3e289cbb6054) and [entity type](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/entity-type.md).|  \n|explicit loading|When objects are returned by a query, related objects are not loaded at the same time.
