Move the ServiceContractAttribute on the specified type to a separate interface that the specified type implements.|  \n|SFxCreateDuplexChannel1|The callback contract of the specified contract either does not exist or does not define any operations. If this is not a duplex contract, use ChannelFactory instead of DuplexChannelFactory.|  \n|SFxCreateDuplexChannelNoCallback|This CreateChannel overload cannot be called on this instance of DuplexChannelFactory. The DuplexChannelFactory was not initialized with an InstanceContext. Call the CreateChannel overload that takes an InstanceContext.|  \n|SFxCreateDuplexChannelNoCallback1|This CreateChannel overload cannot be called on this instance of DuplexChannelFactory. The DuplexChannelFactory was initialized with a Type and no valid InstanceContext was provided.

The endpoints share the same specified initiating action. Messages with this action would be dropped because the dispatcher would not be able to determine the correct endpoint for handling the message.|  \n|SFXEndpointBehaviorUsedOnWrongSide|The specified IEndpointBehavior cannot be used on the server. This behavior can only applies to clients.|  \n|SFxEndpointNoMatchingScheme|The base address that matches the specified scheme for the endpoint with the specified binding cannot be found.

The operation cannot have any 'out' or 'ref' parameters.|  \n|SFxInvalidReplyAction|The outgoing reply message for the operation has the specified Action, but the contract for that operation specifies another ReplyAction. The Action specified in the message must match the ReplyAction in the contract, or the operation contract must specify ReplyAction='*'.|  \n|SFxInvalidRequestAction|The outgoing request message for the operation has the specified Action, but the contract for that operation specifies another RequestAction. The Action specified in the message must match the RequestAction in the contract, or the operation contract must specify RequestAction='*'.|  \n|SFxInvalidStaticOverloadCalledForDuplexChannelFactory1|The static CreateChannel method cannot be used with the specified contract because that contract defines a callback contract.

However, your client code requires the specified action.|  \n|SFxRequestReplyNone|A message was received with a WS-Addressing ReplyTo or FaultTo header targeted at the \"None\" address. These values are not valid for request-reply operations. Use a one-way operation or enable ManualAddressing if you need to support ReplyTo or FaultTo values of \"None\".|  \n|SFxRequestTimedOut1|This request operation did not receive a reply within the specified configured time. The time allowed may have been part of a longer timeout. This may be because the service is still processing the operation or because the service was unable to send a reply message.|  \n|SFxRequestTimedOut2|The request operation sent to the specified location did not receive a reply within the specified configured time. The time allowed may have been part of a longer timeout. This may be because the service is still processing the operation or because the service was unable to send a reply message.|  \n|SFxSchemaDoesNotContainType|Schema with the specified target namespace does not contain a type with the specified name.|  \n|SfxServiceContractAttributeNotFound|The specified contract type is not attributed with ServiceContractAttribute. To define a valid contract, the specified type must be attributed with ServiceContractAttribute.

Request streams cannot be accessed after the service operation returns.|  \n|SFxStreamResponseMessageClosed|The message that contains this stream has been closed.|  \n|SFxTerminateRequestProcessingException|An extension in the operation pipeline must quit processing this message.|  \n|SFxTerminatingOperationAlreadyCalled1|This channel cannot send any more messages because the IsTerminating operation was called.|  \n|SFxThrottleLimitMustBeGreaterThanZero0|The throttle limit must be greater than zero. To disable the throttle limit, set the value to Int32.MaxValue.|  \n|SFxTypedOrUntypedMessageCannotBeMixedWithVoidInRpc|When using the RPC-encoded style, message contract types or the System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message type cannot be used if the operation has no parameters or has a void return value.
