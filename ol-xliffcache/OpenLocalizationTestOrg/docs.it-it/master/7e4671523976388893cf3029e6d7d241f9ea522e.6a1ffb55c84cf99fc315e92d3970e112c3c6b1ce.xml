discuss the creation and management of managed threads, how to pass data to managed threads and get results back, and how to destroy threads and handle a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException>.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Creating Threads and Passing Data at Start Time](../../../docs/standard/threading/creating-threads-and-passing-data-at-start-time.md)  \n Discusses and demonstrates the creation of managed threads, including how to pass data to new threads and how to get data back.  \n  \n [Pausing and Resuming Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/pausing-and-resuming-threads.md)  \n Discusses the ramifications of pausing and resuming managed threads.  \n  \n [Destroying Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/destroying-threads.md)  \n Discusses the ramifications of destroying managed threads, and how to handle a <xref:System.Threading.ThreadAbortException>.  \n  \n [Scheduling Threads](../../../docs/standard/threading/scheduling-threads.md)  \n Discusses thread priorities and how they affect thread scheduling.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Threading.Thread>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Threading.Thread> class, which represents a managed thread, whether it came from unmanaged code or was created in a managed application.  \n  \n <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadStart> delegate that represents parameterless thread procedures.  \n  \n <xref:System.Threading.ParameterizedThreadStart>  \n Provides an easy way to pass data to a thread procedure, although without strong typing.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Threads and Threading](../../../docs/standard/threading/threads-and-threading.md)  \n Provides an introduction to managed threading.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,56],"content":"Using Threads and Threading |
