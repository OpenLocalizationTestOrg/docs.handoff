This error may have occurred for several reasons:  \n  \n-   Insufficient permissions.  \n  \n-   Missing system files required for Authenticode signing.  \n  \n-   A reference to a non-existent certificate or private-key file.  \n  \n-   Incorrect spelling of a file name or URL.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31028  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Enter correct certificate and private key file names.  \n  \n2.  If you are using Authenticode signing, check that the files, Signcode.exe and Javasign.dll, are present, and that their read-only attribute is not set.  \n  \n3.  Make sure you have `Write` permission to the file.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [SignTool.exe (Sign Tool)](../../framework/tools/signtool-exe.md)\n- [How to: Sign application and deployment manifests](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,202],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Unable to sign file '<filename>': <error>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31028\"\n  - \"vbc31028\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31028\"\nms.assetid: 2cb22e75-5ee2-4e07-afc0-680a0bd543d4","nodes":[{"content":"Unable to sign file '<filename>': <error>","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"Unable to sign file '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;filename&gt;</ph>': <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;error&gt;</ph>","source":"Unable to sign file '<filename>': <error>"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[209,252],"content":"Unable to sign file '\\<filename>': \\<error>","linkify":"Unable to sign file '\\<filename>': \\<error>","nodes":[{"content":"Unable to sign file '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>filename&gt;': <ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>error&gt;","pos":[0,43],"source":"Unable to sign file '\\<filename>': \\<error>"}]},{"content":"An error occurred when trying to sign the specified file.","pos":[253,310]},{"content":"This error may have occurred for several reasons:","pos":[311,360]},{"content":"Insufficient permissions.","pos":[370,395]},{"content":"Missing system files required for Authenticode signing.","pos":[405,460]},{"content":"A reference to a non-existent certificate or private-key file.","pos":[470,532]},{"content":"Incorrect spelling of a file name or URL.","pos":[542,583]},{"pos":[590,611],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31028","source":"**Error ID:** BC31028"},{"pos":[620,641],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Enter correct certificate and private key file names.","pos":[651,704]},{"content":"If you are using Authenticode signing, check that the files, Signcode.exe and Javasign.dll, are present, and that their read-only attribute is not set.","pos":[714,865]},{"pos":[875,925],"content":"Make sure you have <ph id=\"ph1\">`Write`</ph> permission to the file.","source":"Make sure you have `Write` permission to the file."},{"pos":[934,942],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[946,1011],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SignTool.exe (Sign Tool)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../framework/tools/signtool-exe.md)</ept>","source":"[SignTool.exe (Sign Tool)](../../framework/tools/signtool-exe.md)"},{"pos":[1014,1133],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign application and deployment manifests<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests)</ept>","source":"[How to: Sign application and deployment manifests](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-sign-application-and-deployment-manifests)"}]}
