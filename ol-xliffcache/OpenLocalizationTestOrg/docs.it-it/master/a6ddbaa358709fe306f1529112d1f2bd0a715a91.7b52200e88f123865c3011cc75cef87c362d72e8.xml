For example, in the following code, `Prop1` is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for `Prop2`.  \n  \n```vb  \nModule M2  \n  \n    Sub ExpressionExample(Of T)(ByVal x As Expressions.Expression(Of Func(Of T)))  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        ' The following line causes the error.  \n        ' ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = 2, .Prop2 = .Prop1})  \n  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36548  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Assign the initial value for `Prop1` to a local variable. Assign that variable to both `Prop1` and `Prop2`, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Sub Main()  \n  \n        Dim temp = 2  \n        ExpressionExample(Function() New With {.Prop1 = temp, .Prop2 = temp})  \n  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Anonymous Types (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)\n- [Expression Trees (Visual Basic)](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)\n- [How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries (Visual Basic)](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/how-to-use-expression-trees-to-build-dynamic-queries.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,289],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc36548\"\n  - \"vbc36548\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36548\"\nms.assetid: 27de068f-080e-4160-86bf-1ec23fd1925a","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","nodes":[{"pos":[0,128],"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","pos":[0,128]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[296,424],"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","linkify":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field","pos":[0,128]}]},{"content":"The compiler does not accept conversion of an anonymous to an expression tree when one property of the anonymous type is used to initialize another property of the anonymous type.","pos":[425,604]},{"content":"For example, in the following code, <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for <ph id=\"ph2\">`Prop2`</ph>.","pos":[605,735],"source":" For example, in the following code, `Prop1` is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for `Prop2`."},{"pos":[1052,1073],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36548","source":"**Error ID:** BC36548"},{"pos":[1082,1103],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Assign the initial value for <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> to a local variable.","pos":[1113,1170],"source":"Assign the initial value for `Prop1` to a local variable."},{"content":"Assign that variable to both <ph id=\"ph1\">`Prop1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`Prop2`</ph>, as shown in the following code.","pos":[1171,1252],"source":" Assign that variable to both `Prop1` and `Prop2`, as shown in the following code."},{"pos":[1424,1432],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1436,1566],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Anonymous Types (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)</ept>","source":"[Anonymous Types (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/anonymous-types.md)"},{"pos":[1569,1662],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Expression Trees (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Expression Trees (Visual Basic)](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/index.md)"},{"pos":[1665,1842],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/how-to-use-expression-trees-to-build-dynamic-queries.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Use Expression Trees to Build Dynamic Queries (Visual Basic)](../../programming-guide/concepts/expression-trees/how-to-use-expression-trees-to-build-dynamic-queries.md)"}]}
