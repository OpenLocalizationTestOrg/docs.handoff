The first two examples use static convenience methods on the <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName> class to write each element of any IEnumerable\\<string> and a string to a text file.  Example 3 shows how to add text to a file when you have to process each line individually as you write to the file.  Examples 1-3 overwrite all existing content in the file, but example 4 shows you how to append text to an existing file.  \n  \n These examples all write string literals to files, but more likely you will want to use the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method, which has many controls for writing different types of values  right or left justified in a field, with or without padding, and so on.  You can also use the C# [string interpolation](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings.md) feature.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csFilesandFolders#3](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-write-to-a-text-file_1.cs)]  \n  \n These examples all write string literals to files, but more likely you will want to use the <xref:System.String.Format%2A> method, which has many controls for writing different types of values  right or left justified in a field, with or without padding, and so on.  You can also use the C# [string interpolation](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/interpolated-strings.md) feature.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The file exists and is read-only.  \n  \n-   The path name may be too long.  \n  \n-   The disk may be full.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)   \n [Sample: Save a collection to Application Storage](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/CSWinStoreAppSaveCollection-bed5d6e6)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,80],"content":"How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[659,710],"content":"How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Write to a Text File (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"These examples show various ways to write text to a file.","pos":[711,768]},{"content":"The first two examples use static convenience methods on the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> class to write each element of any IEnumerable<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>string&gt;
