This section demonstrates one of these methods. For additional information, see [Reflection Overview](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md).  \n  \n The following example obtains type and member information from an assembly.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/cpp/source6.cpp#8)]\n [!code-csharp[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/cs/source6.cs#8)]\n [!code-vb[Conceptual.Types.ViewInfo#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.types.viewinfo/vb/source6.vb#8)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Programming with Application Domains](./application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)\n- [Reflection](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)\n- [Using Application Domains](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,348],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\n  - \"cpp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"obtaining assembly information\"\n  - \"assemblies [.NET Framework], obtaining information from\"\nms.assetid: 348ae651-ccda-4f13-8eda-19e8337e9438\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[355,414],"content":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","linkify":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Obtain Type and Member Information from an Assembly","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Reflection&gt;</ph> namespace contains many methods for obtaining information from an assembly.","pos":[415,519],"source":"The <xref:System.Reflection> namespace contains many methods for obtaining information from an assembly."},{"content":"This section demonstrates one of these methods.","pos":[520,567]},{"content":"For additional information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Reflection Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)</ept>.","pos":[568,684],"source":" For additional information, see [Reflection Overview](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)."},{"content":"The following example obtains type and member information from an assembly.","pos":[691,766]},{"pos":[775,782],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1201,1209],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1213,1314],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Programming with Application Domains<ept id=\"p1\">](./application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)</ept>","source":"[Programming with Application Domains](./application-domains.md#programming-with-application-domains)"},{"pos":[1317,1391],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Reflection<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)</ept>","source":"[Reflection](../../../docs/framework/reflection-and-codedom/reflection.md)"},{"pos":[1394,1465],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Application Domains<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Application Domains](../../../docs/framework/app-domains/use.md)"}]}
