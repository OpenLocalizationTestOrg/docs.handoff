The following sections show some simple ways to supply parameters and return values from procedures on separate threads.  \n  \n## Supplying Parameters for Multithreaded Procedures  \n The best way to supply parameters for a multithreaded method call is to wrap the target method in a class and define fields for that class that will serve as parameters for the new thread. The advantage of this approach is that you can create a new instance of the class, with its own parameters, every time you want to start a new thread. For example, suppose you have a function that calculates the area of a triangle, as in the following code:  \n  \n```csharp  \ndouble CalcArea(double Base, double Height)  \n{  \n    return 0.5 * Base * Height;  \n}  \n```  \n  \n You can write a class that wraps the `CalcArea` function and creates fields to store input parameters, as follows:  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass AreaClass  \n{  \n    public double Base;  \n    public double Height;  \n    public double Area;  \n    public void CalcArea()  \n    {  \n        Area = 0.5 * Base * Height;  \n        MessageBox.Show(\"The area is: \" + Area.ToString());  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n To use the `AreaClass`, you can create an `AreaClass` object, and set the `Base` and `Height` properties as shown in the following code:  \n  \n```csharp  \nprotected void TestArea()  \n{  \n    AreaClass AreaObject = new AreaClass();  \n  \n    System.Threading.Thread Thread =  \n        new System.Threading.Thread(AreaObject.CalcArea);  \n    AreaObject.Base = 30;  \n    AreaObject.Height = 40;  \n    Thread.Start();  \n}  \n```  \n  \n Notice that the `TestArea` procedure does not check the value of the `Area` field after calling the `CalcArea` method. Because `CalcArea` runs on a separate thread, the `Area` field is not guaranteed to be set if you check it immediately after calling `Thread.Start`. The next section discusses a better way to return values from multithreaded procedures.  \n  \n## Returning Values from Multithreaded Procedures  \n Returning values from procedures that run on separate threads is complicated by the fact that the procedures cannot be functions and cannot use `ByRef` arguments. The easiest way to return values is to use the <xref:System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker> component to manage your threads and raise an event when the task is done, and process the results with an event handler.  \n  \n The following example returns a value by raising an event from a procedure running on a separate thread:  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass AreaClass2  \n{  \n    public double Base;  \n    public double Height;  \n    public double CalcArea()  \n    {  \n        // Calculate the area of a triangle.  \n        return 0.5 * Base * Height;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \nprivate System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker BackgroundWorker1  \n    = new System.ComponentModel.BackgroundWorker();  \n  \nprivate void TestArea2()  \n{  \n    InitializeBackgroundWorker();  \n  \n    AreaClass2 AreaObject2 = new AreaClass2();  \n    AreaObject2.Base = 30;  \n    AreaObject2.Height = 40;  \n  \n    // Start the asynchronous operation.  \n    BackgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync(AreaObject2);  \n}  \n  \nprivate void InitializeBackgroundWorker()  \n{  \n    // Attach event handlers to the BackgroundWorker object.  \n    BackgroundWorker1.DoWork +=  \n        new System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventHandler(BackgroundWorker1_DoWork);  \n    BackgroundWorker1.RunWorkerCompleted +=  \n        new System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler(BackgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted);  \n}  \n  \nprivate void BackgroundWorker1_DoWork(  \n    object sender,  \n    System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs e)  \n{  \n    AreaClass2 AreaObject2 = (AreaClass2)e.Argument;  \n    // Return the value through the Result property.  \n    e.Result = AreaObject2.CalcArea();  \n}  \n  \nprivate void BackgroundWorker1_RunWorkerCompleted(  \n    object sender,  \n    System.ComponentModel.RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e)  \n{  \n    // Access the result through the Result property.  \n    double Area = (double)e.Result;  \n    MessageBox.Show(\"The area is: \" + Area.ToString());  \n}  \n```  \n  \n You can provide parameters and return values to thread-pool threads by using the optional `ByVal` state-object variable of the <xref:System.Threading.ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem%2A> method. Thread-timer threads also support a state object for this purpose.
