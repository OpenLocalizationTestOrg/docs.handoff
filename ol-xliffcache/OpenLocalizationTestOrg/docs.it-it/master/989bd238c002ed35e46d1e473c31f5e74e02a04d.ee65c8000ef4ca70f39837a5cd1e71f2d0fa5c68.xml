One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout. When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,377],"nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,74],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,74]}]}],"pos":[6,83],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: 8358898e-129e-4fac-a6bf-bf3aa4293ae2\ncaps.latest.revision: 5\nauthor: \"Erikre\"\nms.author: \"erikre\"\nmanager: \"erikre\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[384,441],"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","linkify":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","nodes":[{"content":"System.ServiceModel.Channels.ConnectionPoolCloseException","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"An exception occurred while closing the connections in this connection pool.","pos":[442,518]},{"pos":[527,538],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"This error level trace indicates that an error has occurred while closing the connection pools used by <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph>’s connection pooling feature.","pos":[542,733],"source":"This error level trace indicates that an error has occurred while closing the connection pools used by [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]’s connection pooling feature."},{"content":"One possible reason for this is an unsuccessful closure of a pooled connection, or a set of pooled connections within the CloseTimeout.","pos":[734,869]},{"content":"When this exception is thrown, any remaining unclosed connections within that pool are aborted; unclosed connections within other pools are abandoned.","pos":[870,1020]},{"pos":[1029,1037],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1041,1115],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1119,1273],"source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1277,1365],"source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
