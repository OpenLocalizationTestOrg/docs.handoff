Covariance permits a method to have return type that is more derived than that defined in the delegate. Contravariance permits a method that has parameter types that are less derived than those in the delegate type.  \n  \n## Example 1: Covariance  \n  \n### Description  \n This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have return types that are derived from the return type in the delegate signature. The data type returned by `DogsHandler` is of type `Dogs`, which derives from the `Mammals` type that is defined in the delegate.  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass Mammals{}  \nclass Dogs : Mammals{}  \n  \nclass Program  \n{  \n    // Define the delegate.  \n    public delegate Mammals HandlerMethod();  \n  \n    public static Mammals MammalsHandler()  \n    {  \n        return null;  \n    }  \n  \n    public static Dogs DogsHandler()  \n    {  \n        return null;  \n    }  \n  \n    static void Test()  \n    {  \n        HandlerMethod handlerMammals = MammalsHandler;  \n  \n        // Covariance enables this assignment.  \n        HandlerMethod handlerDogs = DogsHandler;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example 2: Contravariance  \n  \n### Description  \n This example demonstrates how delegates can be used with methods that have parameters of a type that are base types of the delegate signature parameter type. With contravariance, you can use one event handler instead of separate handlers. For example, you can create an event handler that accepts an `EventArgs` input parameter and use it with a `Button.MouseClick` event that sends a `MouseEventArgs` type as a parameter, and also with a `TextBox.KeyDown` event that sends a `KeyEventArgs` parameter.  \n  \n### Code  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Event hander that accepts a parameter of the EventArgs type.  \nprivate void MultiHandler(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n{  \n    label1.Text = System.DateTime.Now.ToString();  \n}  \n  \npublic Form1()  \n{  \n    InitializeComponent();  \n  \n    // You can use a method that has an EventArgs parameter,  \n    // although the event expects the KeyEventArgs parameter.  \n    this.button1.KeyDown += this.MultiHandler;  \n  \n    // You can use the same method   \n    // for an event that expects the MouseEventArgs parameter.  \n    this.button1.MouseClick += this.MultiHandler;  \n  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Variance in Delegates (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/variance-in-delegates.md)   \n [Using Variance for Func and Action Generic Delegates (C#)](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/covariance-contravariance/using-variance-for-func-and-action-generic-delegates.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,413],"nodes":[{"content":"Using Variance in Delegates (C#) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"Using Variance in Delegates (C#) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Using Variance in Delegates (C#) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]}],"pos":[6,58],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Using Variance in Delegates (C#) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
