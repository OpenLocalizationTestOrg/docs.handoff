When you serialize the XML with formatting, only significant white space in the XML tree is preserved. This is the default behavior for [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)].  \n  \n Another common scenario is to read and modify XML that has already been intentionally indented. You might not want to change this indentation in any way. To do this in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)], you preserve white space when you load or parse the XML and disable formatting when you serialize the XML.  \n  \n## White Space Behavior of Methods that Serialize XML Trees  \n The following methods in the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> classes serialize an XML tree. You can serialize an XML tree to a file, a <xref:System.IO.TextReader>, or an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. The `ToString` method serializes to a string.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement.Save%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.Save%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.ToString%2A?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n If the method does not take <xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions> as an argument, then the method will format (indent) the serialized XML. In this case, all insignificant white space in the XML tree is discarded.  \n  \n If the method does take <xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions> as an argument, then you can specify that the method not format (indent) the serialized XML. In this case, all white space in the XML tree is preserved.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Serializing XML Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/serializing-xml-trees.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,70],"content":"Preserving White Space While Serializing2 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Preserving White Space While Serializing2 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,58]}]},{"pos":[451,491],"content":"Preserving White Space While Serializing","linkify":"Preserving White Space While Serializing","nodes":[{"content":"Preserving White Space While Serializing","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"This topic describes how to control white space when serializing an XML tree.","pos":[492,569]},{"content":"A common scenario is to read indented XML, create an in-memory XML tree without any white space text nodes (that is, not preserving white space), perform some operations on the XML, and then save the XML with indentation.","pos":[576,797]},{"content":"When you serialize the XML with formatting, only significant white space in the XML tree is preserved.","pos":[798,900]},{"content":"This is the default behavior for <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[901,1037],"source":" This is the default behavior for [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)]."},{"content":"Another common scenario is to read and modify XML that has already been intentionally indented.","pos":[1044,1139]},{"content":"You might not want to change this indentation in any way.","pos":[1140,1197]},{"content":"To do this in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)]</ph>, you preserve white space when you load or parse the XML and disable formatting when you serialize the XML.","pos":[1198,1422],"source":" To do this in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)], you preserve white space when you load or parse the XML and disable formatting when you serialize the XML."},{"pos":[1431,1487],"content":"White Space Behavior of Methods that Serialize XML Trees","linkify":"White Space Behavior of Methods that Serialize XML Trees","nodes":[{"content":"White Space Behavior of Methods that Serialize XML Trees","pos":[0,56]}]},{"content":"The following methods in the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument&gt;</ph> classes serialize an XML tree.","pos":[1491,1619],"source":"The following methods in the <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument> classes serialize an XML tree."},{"content":"You can serialize an XML tree to a file, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.TextReader&gt;</ph>, or an <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.XmlReader&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1620,1726],"source":" You can serialize an XML tree to a file, a <xref:System.IO.TextReader>, or an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`ToString`</ph> method serializes to a string.","pos":[1727,1772],"source":" The `ToString` method serializes to a string."},{"content":"If the method does not take <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions&gt;</ph> as an argument, then the method will format (indent) the serialized XML.","pos":[2085,2220],"source":"If the method does not take <xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions> as an argument, then the method will format (indent) the serialized XML."},{"content":"In this case, all insignificant white space in the XML tree is discarded.","pos":[2221,2294]},{"content":"If the method does take <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions&gt;</ph> as an argument, then you can specify that the method not format (indent) the serialized XML.","pos":[2301,2452],"source":"If the method does take <xref:System.Xml.Linq.SaveOptions> as an argument, then you can specify that the method not format (indent) the serialized XML."},{"content":"In this case, all white space in the XML tree is preserved.","pos":[2453,2512]},{"pos":[2521,2529],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2533,2654],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Serializing XML Trees (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/serializing-xml-trees.md)</ept>","source":"[Serializing XML Trees (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/serializing-xml-trees.md)"}]}
