You must add a reference to assembly 'assembly'.  \n  \n The definition for a referenced type was not found. This could occur if a required .DLL file is not included in the compilation. For more information, see [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) and [/reference (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n The following sequence of compilations will result in CS0012:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs0012a.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library  \npublic class A {}  \n```  \n  \n Then:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs0012b.cs  \n// compile with: /target:library /reference:cs0012a.dll  \npublic class B  \n{  \n   public static A f()  \n   {  \n      return new A();  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n Then:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs0012c.cs  \n// compile with: /reference:cs0012b.dll  \nclass C  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n      object o = B.f();   // CS0012  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n You could resolve this CS0012 by compiling with `/reference:cs0012b.dll;cs0012a.dll`, or in Visual Studio by using the [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) to add a reference to cs0012a.dll in addition to cs0012b.dll.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0012\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0012\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0012\"\nms.assetid: 5523e349-22f4-4b0b-b4b0-c4bf26c461f4","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0012","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0012","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0012","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0012","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0012","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0012","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"The type 'type' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.","pos":[194,259]},{"content":"You must add a reference to assembly 'assembly'.","pos":[260,308]},{"content":"The definition for a referenced type was not found.","pos":[315,366]},{"content":"This could occur if a required .DLL file is not included in the compilation.","pos":[367,443]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Add Reference Dialog Box<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>/reference (C# Compiler Options)<ept id=\"p2\">](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md)</ept>.","pos":[444,697],"source":" For more information, see [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) and [/reference (C# Compiler Options)](../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/reference-compiler-option.md)."},{"content":"The following sequence of compilations will result in CS0012:","pos":[704,765]},{"content":"Then:","pos":[864,869]},{"content":"Then:","pos":[1059,1064]},{"pos":[1251,1540],"content":"You could resolve this CS0012 by compiling with <ph id=\"ph1\">`/reference:cs0012b.dll;cs0012a.dll`</ph>, or in Visual Studio by using the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Add Reference Dialog Box<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager)</ept> to add a reference to cs0012a.dll in addition to cs0012b.dll.","source":"You could resolve this CS0012 by compiling with `/reference:cs0012b.dll;cs0012a.dll`, or in Visual Studio by using the [Add Reference Dialog Box](/visualstudio/ide/how-to-add-or-remove-references-by-using-the-reference-manager) to add a reference to cs0012a.dll in addition to cs0012b.dll."}]}
