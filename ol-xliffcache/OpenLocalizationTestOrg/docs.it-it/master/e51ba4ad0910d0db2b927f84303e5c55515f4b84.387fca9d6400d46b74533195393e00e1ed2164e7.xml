Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type.  \n  \n The following code causes this error:  \n  \n```vb  \n' Select Case (Function(arg) arg Is Nothing)  \n    ' List of the cases.  \n' End Select  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36635  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you.  \n  \n-   You may have intended to call the function, as shown in the following code:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim num? As Integer  \nSelect Case ((Function(arg? As Integer) arg Is Nothing)(num))  \n    ' List of the cases  \nEnd Select  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)\n- [If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)\n- [Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,246],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc36635\"\n  - \"vbc36635\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36635\"\nms.assetid: 74609979-9c03-4864-bbce-f588aa2e0917","nodes":[{"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","nodes":[{"pos":[0,85],"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","nodes":[{"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","pos":[0,85]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[253,338],"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","linkify":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","nodes":[{"content":"Lambda expressions are not valid in the first expression of a 'Select Case' statement","pos":[0,85]}]},{"content":"You cannot use a lambda expression for the test expression in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Select Case`</ph> statement.","pos":[339,427],"source":"You cannot use a lambda expression for the test expression in a `Select Case` statement."},{"content":"Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Select Case`</ph> statement must be an elementary data type.","pos":[428,561],"source":" Lambda expression definitions return functions, and the test expression of a `Select Case` statement must be an elementary data type."},{"content":"The following code causes this error:","pos":[568,605]},{"pos":[718,739],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36635","source":"**Error ID:** BC36635"},{"pos":[748,769],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[779,916],"content":"Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`If...Then...Else`</ph> statement, would work for you.","source":"Examine your code to determine whether a different conditional construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement, would work for you."},{"content":"You may have intended to call the function, as shown in the following code:","pos":[926,1001]},{"pos":[1152,1160],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1164,1276],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept>","source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)"},{"pos":[1279,1386],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[If...Then...Else Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1389,1492],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Select...Case Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Select...Case Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/select-case-statement.md)"}]}
