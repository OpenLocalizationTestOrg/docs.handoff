In the following example, the `test` class has no constructors that take any arguments. It therefore has only a default constructor that takes zero arguments. Because in the second line in which the error is generated, the derived class declares no constructors of its own, the compiler provides a default constructor. That constructor invokes a parameterless constructor in the base class. Because the base class has no such constructor, CS1729 is generated.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Adjust the number of parameters in the call to the constructor.  \n  \n2.  Modify the class to provide a constructor with the parameters you must call.  \n  \n3.  Provide a parameterless constructor in the base class.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example generates CS1729:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// cs1729.cs  \nclass Test  \n{  \n    static int Main()  \n    {  \n        // Class Test has only a default constructor, which takes no arguments.  \n        Test test1 = new Test(2); // CS1729  \n        // The following line resolves the error.  \n        Test test2 = new Test();  \n  \n        // Class Parent has only one constructor, which takes two int parameters.  \n        Parent exampleParent1 = new Parent(10); // CS1729  \n        // The following line resolves the error.  \n        Parent exampleParent2 = new Parent(10, 1);  \n  \n        return 1;  \n    }  \n}  \n  \npublic class Parent  \n{  \n    // The only constructor for this class has two parameters.  \n    public Parent(int i, int j) { }  \n}  \n  \n// The following declaration causes a compiler error because class Parent  \n// does not have a constructor that takes no arguments. The declaration of  \n// class Child2 shows how to resolve this error.  \npublic class Child : Parent { } // CS1729  \n  \npublic class Child2 : Parent  \n{  \n    // The constructor for Child2 has only one parameter. To access the   \n    // constructor in Parent, and prevent this compiler error, you must provide   \n    // a value for the second parameter of Parent. The following example provides 0.  \n    public Child2(int k)  \n        : base(k, 0)  \n    {  \n        // Add the body of the constructor here.  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Inheritance](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md)\n- [Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1729\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1729\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1729\"\nms.assetid: 69d24ae0-eaca-4fbf-a5f3-70791f43f97a","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1729","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1729","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1729","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1729","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1729","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1729","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'type' does not contain a constructor that takes 'number' arguments.","pos":[194,262]},{"content":"This error occurs when you either directly or indirectly invoke the constructor of a class but the compiler cannot find any constructors with the same number of parameters.","pos":[269,441]},{"content":"In the following example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`test`</ph> class has no constructors that take any arguments.","pos":[442,529],"source":" In the following example, the `test` class has no constructors that take any arguments."},{"content":"It therefore has only a default constructor that takes zero arguments.","pos":[530,600]},{"content":"Because in the second line in which the error is generated, the derived class declares no constructors of its own, the compiler provides a default constructor.","pos":[601,760]},{"content":"That constructor invokes a parameterless constructor in the base class.","pos":[761,832]},{"content":"Because the base class has no such constructor, CS1729 is generated.","pos":[833,901]},{"pos":[910,931],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Adjust the number of parameters in the call to the constructor.","pos":[941,1004]},{"content":"Modify the class to provide a constructor with the parameters you must call.","pos":[1014,1090]},{"content":"Provide a parameterless constructor in the base class.","pos":[1100,1154]},{"pos":[1163,1170],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example generates CS1729:","pos":[1174,1213]},{"pos":[2600,2608],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2612,2695],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inheritance<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md)</ept>","source":"[Inheritance](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance.md)"},{"pos":[2698,2783],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Constructors<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)</ept>","source":"[Constructors](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors.md)"}]}
