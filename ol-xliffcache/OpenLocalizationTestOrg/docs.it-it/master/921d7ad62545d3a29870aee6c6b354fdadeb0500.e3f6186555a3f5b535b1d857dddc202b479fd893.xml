This example shows how you can get an array of the characters in a string by calling the string's <xref:System.String.ToCharArray%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example demonstrates how to split a string into a `Char` array, and how to split a string into a `String` array of its Unicode text characters. The reason for this distinction is that Unicode text characters can be composed of two or more `Char` characters (such as a surrogate pair or a combining character sequence). For more information, see <xref:System.Globalization.TextElementEnumerator> and [The Unicode Standard](https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#75](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStrings/VB/Class4.vb#75)]  \n  \n## Example  \n It is more difficult to split a string into its Unicode text characters, but this is necessary if you need information about the visual representation of a string. This example uses the <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo.SubstringByTextElements%2A> method to get information about the Unicode text characters that make up a string.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrStrings#76](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrStrings/VB/Class4.vb#76)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.String.Chars%2A>\n- <xref:System.Globalization.StringInfo?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [How to: Access Characters in Strings](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/how-to-access-characters-in-strings.md)\n- [Converting Between Strings and Other Data Types in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/converting-between-strings-and-other-data-types.md)\n- [Strings](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,426],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Convert a String to an Array of Characters in Visual Basic\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
