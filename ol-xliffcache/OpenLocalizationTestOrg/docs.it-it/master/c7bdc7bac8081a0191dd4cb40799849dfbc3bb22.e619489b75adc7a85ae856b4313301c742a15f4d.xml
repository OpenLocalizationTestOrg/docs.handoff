Defining endpoints in code is usually not practical because the bindings and addresses for a deployed service are typically different from those used while the service is being developed. More generally, keeping the binding and addressing information out of the code allows them to change without having to recompile or redeploy the application.  \n  \n For a description of how to configure this service using configuration elements instead of code, see [How to: Specify a Service Binding in Configuration](../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-specify-a-service-binding-in-configuration.md).  \n  \n### To specify in code to use the BasicHttpBinding for the service  \n  \n1.
