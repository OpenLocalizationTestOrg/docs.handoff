The encoder determines the body format of the message by looking at the HTTP content-type of the request. This sample introduces the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentTypeMapper> class, which allows the user to control the mapping between content type and body format.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] provides a set of default mappings for content types. For example, `application/json` maps to JSON and `text/xml` maps to XML. Any content type that is not mapped to JSON or XML is mapped to raw binary format.  \n  \n In some scenarios (for example, push-style APIs), the service developer does not control the content type returned by the client. For example, clients might return JSON as `text/javascript` instead of `application/json`. In this case, the service developer must provide a type that derives from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentTypeMapper> to handle the given content type correctly, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \npublic class JsonContentTypeMapper : WebContentTypeMapper  \n{  \n    public override WebContentFormat  \n               GetMessageFormatForContentType(string contentType)  \n    {  \n        if (contentType == \"text/javascript\")  \n        {  \n            return WebContentFormat.Json;  \n        }  \n        else  \n        {  \n            return WebContentFormat.Default;  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n The type must override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentTypeMapper.GetMessageFormatForContentType%28System.String%29> method. The method must evaluate the `contentType` argument and return one of the following values: <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentFormat>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentFormat>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentFormat>, or <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentFormat>. Returning <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.WebContentFormat> defers to the default Web message encoder mappings. In the previous sample code, the `text/javascript` content type is mapped to JSON, and all other mappings remain unchanged.  \n  \n To use the `JsonContentTypeMapper` class, use the following in your Web.config:  \n  \n```  \n<system.serviceModel>  \n  <standardEndpoints>  \n    <webHttpEndpoint>  \n      <standardEndpoint name=\"\" contentTypeMapper=\"Microsoft.Samples.WebContentTypeMapper.JsonContentTypeMapper, JsonContentTypeMapper, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\" />  \n    </webHttpEndpoint>  \n  </standardEndpoints>  \n</system.serviceModel>  \n```  \n  \n To verify the requirement for using the JsonContentTypeMapper, remove the contentTypeMapper attribute from the above configuration file. The client page fails to load when attempting to use `text/javascript` to send JSON content.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  Build the solution WebContentTypeMapperSample.sln as described in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  Navigate to http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/JCTMClientPage.htm (do not open JCTMClientPage.htm in the browser from within the project directory).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
