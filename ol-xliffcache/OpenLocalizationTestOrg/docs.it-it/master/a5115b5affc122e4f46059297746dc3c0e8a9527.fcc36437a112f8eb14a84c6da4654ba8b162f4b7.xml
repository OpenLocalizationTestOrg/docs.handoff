Before C# 6, the way to do this is with `System.String.Format`. This works okay, but since it uses numbered placeholders, it can be harder to read and more verbose.\n\nOther programming languages have had string interpolation built into the language for a while. For instance, in PHP:\n\n```php\n$name = \"Jonas\";\necho \"My name is $name.\";\n// This will output \"My name is Jonas.\"\n```\n\nIn C# 6, we finally have that style of string interpolation. You can use a `$` before a string to indicate that it should substitute variables/expressions for their values.\n\n## Prerequisites\nYou’ll need to set up your machine to run .NET core. You can find the\ninstallation instructions on the [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)\npage.\nYou can run this application on Windows, Ubuntu Linux, macOS or in a Docker container. \nYou’ll need to install your favorite code editor. The descriptions below\nuse [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is an open\nsource, cross platform editor. However, you can use whatever tools you are\ncomfortable with.\n\n## Create the Application\n\nNow that you've installed all the tools, create a new .NET Core\napplication. To use the command line generator, create a directory for your project, such as `interpolated`, and execute the following command in your favorite shell:\n\n```\ndotnet new console\n```\n\nThis command will create a barebones .NET core project with a project file, *interpolated.csproj*, and a source code file, *Program.cs*. You will need to execute `dotnet restore` to restore the dependencies needed to compile this project.\n\nTo execute the program, use `dotnet run`. You should see \"Hello, World\" output to the console.\n\n## Intro to String Interpolation\n\nWith `System.String.Format`, you specify \"placeholders\" in a string that are replaced by the parameters following the string. For instance:\n\n[!code-csharp[String.Format example](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/string-interpolation.cs#StringFormatExample)]  \n\nThat will output \"My name is Matt Groves\".\n\nIn C# 6, instead of using `String.Format`, you define an interpolated string by prepending it with the `$` symbol, and then using the variables directly in the string. For instance:\n\n[!code-csharp[Interpolation example](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/string-interpolation.cs#InterpolationExample)]  \n\nYou don't have to use just variables. You can use any expression within the brackets. For instance:\n\n[!code-csharp[Interpolation expression example](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/string-interpolation.cs#InterpolationExpressionExample)]  \n\nWhich would output:\n\n```\nThis is line number 1\nThis is line number 2\nThis is line number 3\nThis is line number 4\nThis is line number 5\n```\n\n## How string interpolation works\n\nBehind the scenes, this string interpolation syntax is translated into String.Format by the compiler. So, you can do the [same type of stuff you've done before with String.Format](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k(v=vs.110).aspx).\n\nFor instance, you can add padding and numeric formatting:\n\n[!code-csharp[Interpolation formatting example](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/string-interpolation.cs#InterpolationFormattingExample)]  \n\nThe above would output something like:\n\n```\n998        5,177.67\n999        6,719.30\n1000       9,910.61\n1001       529.34\n1002       1,349.86\n1003       2,660.82\n1004       6,227.77\n```\n\nIf a variable name is not found, then a compile time error will be generated.\n\nFor instance:\n\n```csharp\nvar animal = \"fox\";\nvar localizeMe = $\"The {adj} brown {animal} jumped over the lazy {otheranimal}\";\nvar adj = \"quick\";\nConsole.WriteLine(localizeMe);\n```\n\nIf you compile this, you'll get errors:\n \n* `Cannot use local variable 'adj' before it is declared` - the `adj` variable wasn't declared until *after* the interpolated string.\n* `The name 'otheranimal' does not exist in the current context` - a variable called `otheranimal` was never even declared\n\n## Localization and Internationalization\n\nAn interpolated string supports `IFormattable` and `FormattableString`, which can be useful for internationalization.\n\nBy default, an interpolated string uses the current culture. To use a different culture, you could cast it as `IFormattable`\n\nFor instance:\n\n[!code-csharp[Interpolation internationalization example](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/new-in-6/string-interpolation.cs#InterpolationInternationalizationExample)]  \n\n## Conclusion \n\nIn this tutorial, you learned how to use string interpolation features of C# 6. It's basically a more concise way of writing simple `String.Format` statements, with some caveats for more advanced uses of it.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,36],"content":"String Interpolation |
