 \n```  \n  \n#### Parameters  \n `address`  \n [in] A `CORDB_ADDRESS` value that specifies the address at which the breakpoint was set.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The specified breakpoint would have been previously set by an earlier call to [ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md).  \n  \n The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method can be called while the process being debugged is running.  \n  \n The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method returns a failure code if the debugger is attached in managed-only mode or if no breakpoint exists at the specified address.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]","nodes":[{"pos":[12,79],"content":"ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,67]}]},{"pos":[783,833],"content":"ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method","linkify":"ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugProcess2::ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint Method","pos":[0,50]}]},{"content":"Removes a previously set breakpoint at the given address.","pos":[834,891]},{"pos":[900,906],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1009,1019],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A <ph id=\"ph1\">`CORDB_ADDRESS`</ph> value that specifies the address at which the breakpoint was set.","pos":[1036,1124],"source":" [in] A `CORDB_ADDRESS` value that specifies the address at which the breakpoint was set."},{"pos":[1133,1140],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1144,1369],"content":"The specified breakpoint would have been previously set by an earlier call to <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md)</ept>.","source":"The specified breakpoint would have been previously set by an earlier call to [ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md)."},{"pos":[1376,1472],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint`</ph> method can be called while the process being debugged is running.","source":"The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method can be called while the process being debugged is running."},{"pos":[1479,1641],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint`</ph> method returns a failure code if the debugger is attached in managed-only mode or if no breakpoint exists at the specified address.","source":"The `ClearUnmanagedBreakpoint` method returns a failure code if the debugger is attached in managed-only mode or if no breakpoint exists at the specified address."},{"pos":[1650,1662],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[1666,1770],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[1777,1813],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h","source":"**Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h"},{"pos":[1820,1845],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorGuids.lib","source":"**Library:** CorGuids.lib"},{"pos":[1852,1960],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]</ph>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]"}]}
