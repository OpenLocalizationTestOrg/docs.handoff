For more information, see [Managing Application Resources (.NET)](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-resources-dotnet).  \n  \n The `My.Resources` object exposes only global resources. It does not provide access to resource files associated with forms. You must access the form resources from the form. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5).  \n  \n You can access the application's culture-specific resource files from the `My.Resources` object. By default, the `My.Resources` object looks up resources from the resource file that matches the culture in the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase.UICulture%2A> property. However, you can override this behavior and specify a particular culture to use for the resources. For more information, see [Resources in Desktop Apps](../../../framework/resources/index.md).  \n  \n## Properties  \n The properties of the `My.Resources` object provide read-only access to your application's resources. To add or remove resources, use the **Project Designer**. For more information, see [How to: Add or Remove Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b77bc06-3952-4799-b029-def3f8f7f88d). You can access resources added through the **Project Designer** by using `My.Resources.``resourceName`.  \n  \n You can also add or remove resource files by selecting your project in **Solution Explorer** and clicking **Add New Item** or **Add Existing Item** from the **Project** menu. You can access resources added in this manner by using `My.Resources.``resourceFileName`.`resourceName`.  \n  \n Each resource has a name, category, and value, and these resource settings determine how the property to access the resource appears in the `My.Resources` object. For resources added in the **Project Designer**:  \n  \n-   The name determines the name of the property,  \n  \n-   The resource data is the value of the property,  \n  \n-   The category determines the type of the property:  \n  \n|Category|Property data type|  \n|---|---|  \n|**Strings**|[String](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/string-data-type.md)|  \n|**Images**|<xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap>|  \n|**Icons**|<xref:System.Drawing.Icon>|  \n|**Audio**|<xref:System.IO.UnmanagedMemoryStream><br /><br /> The <xref:System.IO.UnmanagedMemoryStream> class derives from the <xref:System.IO.Stream> class, so it can be used with methods that take streams, such as the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio.Play%2A> method.|  \n|**Files**|-   [String](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/string-data-type.md) for text files.<br />-   <xref:System.Drawing.Bitmap> for image files.<br />-   <xref:System.Drawing.Icon> for icon files.<br />-   <xref:System.IO.UnmanagedMemoryStream> for sound files.|  \n|**Other**|Determined by the information in the designer's **Type** column.|  \n  \n## Classes  \n The `My.Resources` object exposes each resource file as a class with shared properties. The class name is the same as the name of the resource file. As described in the previous section, the resources in a resource file are exposed as properties in the class.  \n  \n## Example  \n This example sets the title of a form to the string resource named `Form1Title` in the application resource file. For the example to work, the application must have a string named `Form1Title` in its resource file. For more information, see [How to: Add or Remove Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b77bc06-3952-4799-b029-def3f8f7f88d).  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#1](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/my-resources-object_1.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example sets the icon of the form to the icon named `Form1Icon` that is stored in the application's resource file. For the example to work, the application must have an icon named `Form1Icon` in its resource file.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#2](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/my-resources-object_2.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example sets the background image of a form to the image resource named `Form1Background`, which is in the application resource file. For this example to work, the application must have an image resource named `Form1Background` in its resource file.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#3](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/my-resources-object_3.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example plays the sound that is stored as an audio resource named `Form1Greeting` in the application's resource file. For the example to work, the application must have an audio resource named `Form1Greeting` in its resource file. The `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method is available only for Windows Forms applications.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyResources#4](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/app-settings/codesnippet/VisualBasic/my-resources-object_4.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n This example retrieves the French-culture version of a  string resource of the application. The resource is named `Message`. To change the culture that the `My.Resources` object uses, the example uses <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase.ChangeUICulture%2A>.  \n  \n For this example to work, the application must have a string named `Message` in its resource file, and the application should have the French-culture version of that resource file, Resources.fr-FR.resx. For more information, see [How to: Add or Remove Resources](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/7b77bc06-3952-4799-b029-def3f8f7f88d). If the application does not have the French-culture version of the resource file, the `My.Resource` object retrieves the resource from the default-culture resource file.  \n  \n
