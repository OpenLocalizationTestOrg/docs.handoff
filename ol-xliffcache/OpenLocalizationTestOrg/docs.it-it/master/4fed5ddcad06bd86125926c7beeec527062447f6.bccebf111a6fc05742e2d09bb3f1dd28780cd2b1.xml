For more information on property identifiers related to control identification, see [UI Automation Properties Overview](../../../docs/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-properties-overview.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty> does not guarantee a unique identity throughout the tree; it typically needs container and scope information to be useful. For example, an application may contain a menu control with multiple top-level menu items that, in turn, have multiple child menu items. These secondary menu items may be identified by a generic scheme such as \"Item1\", \"Item 2\", and so on, allowing duplicate identifiers for children across top-level menu items.  \n  \n## Scenarios  \n Three primary UI Automation client application scenarios have been identified that require the use of <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty> to achieve accurate and consistent results when searching for elements.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty> is supported by all UI Automation elements in the control view except top-level application windows, UI Automation elements derived from [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls that do not have an ID or x:Uid, and UI Automation elements derived from [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](../../../includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)] controls that do not have a control ID.  \n  \n#### Use a unique and discoverable AutomationID to locate a specific element in the UI Automation tree  \n  \n-   Use a tool such as [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uispy](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uispy-md.md)] to report the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty> of a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_ui](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-ui-md.md)] element of interest. This value can then be copied and pasted into a client application such as a test script for subsequent automated testing. This approach reduces and simplifies the code necessary to identify and locate an element at runtime.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  In general, you should try to obtain only direct children of the <xref:System.Windows.Automation.AutomationElement.RootElement%2A>. A search for descendants may iterate through hundreds or even thousands of elements, possibly resulting in a stack overflow.

These elements can only be instantiated by reproducing, or \"playing back\", a specific sequence of [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)] actions through the use of [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] properties such as AutomationID, control patterns and event listeners. See [Test Script Generator Sample](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/028467fd-2980-4691-9522-0131dcef23a0) for an example that uses [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] to generate test scripts based on user interaction with the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ui](../../../includes/tlasharptla-ui-md.md)].  \n  \n [!code-csharp[UIAAutomationID_snip#UIAWorkerThread](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAAutomationID_snip/CSharp/FindByAutomationID.xaml.cs#uiaworkerthread)]\n [!code-vb[UIAAutomationID_snip#UIAWorkerThread](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAAutomationID_snip/VisualBasic/FindByAutomationID.xaml.vb#uiaworkerthread)]  \n[!code-csharp[UIAAutomationID_snip#Playback](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAAutomationID_snip/CSharp/FindByAutomationID.xaml.cs#playback)]\n[!code-vb[UIAAutomationID_snip#Playback](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/UIAAutomationID_snip/VisualBasic/FindByAutomationID.xaml.vb#playback)]  \n  \n#### Use a relative path to return to a previously identified AutomationElement  \n  \n-   In certain circumstances, since AutomationID is only guaranteed to be unique amongst siblings, multiple elements in the UI Automation tree may have identical AutomationID property values.

For example, a developer may provide a menu bar with multiple menu items each with multiple child menu items where the children are identified with sequential AutomationID's such as \"Item1\", \"Item2\", and so on.
