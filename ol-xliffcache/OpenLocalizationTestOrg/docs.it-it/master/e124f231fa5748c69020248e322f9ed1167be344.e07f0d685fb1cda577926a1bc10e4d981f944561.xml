A method with an optional parameter is equivalent to two overloaded methods, one with the optional parameter, and the other without it. Therefore, you cannot overload a method with an argument list corresponding to either of these.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30305  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than only optional parameters.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Procedure Overloading](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)\n- [Considerations in Overloading Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,285],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30305\"\n  - \"bc30305\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30305\"\nms.assetid: f07f925e-9f95-4885-bdba-eaba2d0483d8","nodes":[{"content":"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters","nodes":[{"pos":[0,124],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;method1&gt;</ph>' and '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;method2&gt;</ph>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters","source":"'<method1>' and '<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[292,418],"content":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters","linkify":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>method1&gt;' and '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>method2&gt;' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters","pos":[0,126],"source":"'\\<method1>' and '\\<method2>' cannot overload each other because they differ only by the default values of optional parameters"}]},{"content":"You have attempted to overload a method with another method that differs from the first only in its optional parameters.","pos":[419,539]},{"content":"A method with an optional parameter is equivalent to two overloaded methods, one with the optional parameter, and the other without it.","pos":[540,675]},{"content":"Therefore, you cannot overload a method with an argument list corresponding to either of these.","pos":[676,771]},{"pos":[778,799],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30305","source":"**Error ID:** BC30305"},{"pos":[808,829],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the methods are differentiated by more than only optional parameters.","pos":[839,920]},{"pos":[929,937],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[941,1056],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Procedure Overloading<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)</ept>","source":"[Procedure Overloading](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/procedure-overloading.md)"},{"pos":[1059,1212],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Considerations in Overloading Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Considerations in Overloading Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/considerations-in-overloading-procedures.md)"}]}
