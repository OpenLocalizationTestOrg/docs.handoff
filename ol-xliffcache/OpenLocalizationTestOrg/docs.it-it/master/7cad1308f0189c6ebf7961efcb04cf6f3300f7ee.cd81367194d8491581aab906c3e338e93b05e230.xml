For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has one parameter of type `Integer`.  \n  \n```vb  \nDelegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer) As String  \n```  \n  \n Therefore, the corresponding parameter of any lambda expression assigned to a variable of type `Del` can be an `Integer` or any data type for which there is a widening conversion from `Integer`.  \n  \n```vb  \n' Valid.  \nDim example1 As Del = Function(n As Integer) \"Valid\"  \nDim example2 As Del = Function(n As Long) \"Valid\"  \n  \n' Not valid.  \nDim example3 As Del = Function(n As Short) \"Not Valid\"  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36662  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the data type of the parameter in the delegate or the lambda expression so that the required widening relationship exists.  \n  \n-   Do not specify parameter data types in the lambda expression. Types will be inferred from the corresponding parameters in the delegate.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim example4 As Del = Function(n) \"Valid\"  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Lambda Expressions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)\n- [Delegates](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/index.md)\n- [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)\n- [Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,291],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Option Strict On does not allow narrowing in implicit type conversions between the lambda expression and delegate '<delegatename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
