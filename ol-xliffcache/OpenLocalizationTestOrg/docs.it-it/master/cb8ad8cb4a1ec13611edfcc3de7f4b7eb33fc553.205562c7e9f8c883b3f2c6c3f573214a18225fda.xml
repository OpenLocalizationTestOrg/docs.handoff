If you define a class or structure and then use a variable of that type in an `OrElse` clause, you must define `IsTrue` on that class or structure.  \n  \n The compiler considers the `IsTrue` and `IsFalse` operators as a *matched pair*. This means that if you define one of them, you must also define the other one.  \n  \n## Compiler Use of IsTrue  \n When you have defined a class or structure, you can use a variable of that type in a `For`, `If`, `Else If`, or `While` statement, or in a `When` clause. If you do this, the compiler requires an operator that converts your type into a `Boolean` value so it can test a condition. It searches for a suitable operator in the following order:  \n  \n1.  A widening conversion operator from your class or structure to `Boolean`.  \n  \n2.  A widening conversion operator from your class or structure to `Boolean?`.  \n  \n3.  The `IsTrue` operator on your class or structure.  \n  \n4.  A narrowing conversion to `Boolean?` that does not involve a conversion from `Boolean` to `Boolean?`.  \n  \n5.  A narrowing conversion operator from your class or structure to `Boolean`.  \n  \n If you have not defined any conversion to `Boolean` or an `IsTrue` operator, the compiler signals an error.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `IsTrue` operator can be *overloaded*, which means that a class or structure can redefine its behavior when its operand has the type of that class or structure. If your code uses this operator on such a class or structure, be sure you understand its redefined behavior. For more information, see [Operator Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example defines the outline of a structure that includes definitions for the `IsFalse` and `IsTrue` operators.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrOperators#28](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrOperators/VB/Class1.vb#28)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [IsFalse Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/isfalse-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [OrElse Operator](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/orelse-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IsTrue Operator (Visual Basic)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
