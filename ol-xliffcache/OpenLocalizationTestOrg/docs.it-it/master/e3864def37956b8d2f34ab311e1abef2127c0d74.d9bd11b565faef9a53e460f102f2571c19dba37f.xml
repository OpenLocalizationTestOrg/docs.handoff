This topic shows how to configure this behavior in a configuration file.  \n  \n### To configure WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior  \n  \n1.  Add a <`workflowUnhandledException`> element in a <`behavior`> element within a <`serviceBehaviors`> element, using the `action` attribute to specify the action to take when an unhandled exception occurs as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"\">  \n          <workflowUnhandledException action=\"abandonAndSuspend\"/>   \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The preceding configuration sample is using simplified configuration. [!INCLUDE[crdefault](../../../../includes/crdefault-md.md)][Simplified Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md).  \n  \n     This behavior can be configured in code as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    host.Description.Behaviors.Add(new WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior { Action = WorkflowUnhandledExceptionAction.AbandonAndSuspend });  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     The `action` attribute of the <`workflowUnhandledException`> element can be set to one of the following values:  \n  \n     **abandon**  \n     Aborts the instance in memory without touching the persisted instance state (that is, roll back to the last persist point).  \n  \n     **abandonAndSuspend**  \n     Aborts the instance in memory and updates the persisted instance to be suspended.  \n  \n     **cancel**  \n     Calls cancellation handlers for the instance and then completes the instance in memory, which may also remove it from the instance store  \n  \n     **terminate**  \n     Completes the instance in memory and removes it from the instance store.  \n  \n     [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior>, see [Workflow Service Host Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-service-host-extensibility.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Workflow Service Host Extensibility](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-service-host-extensibility.md)   \n [Workflow Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/workflow-services.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,109],"content":"How to: Configure Workflow Unhandled Exception Behavior with WorkflowServiceHost | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Configure Workflow Unhandled Exception Behavior with WorkflowServiceHost | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,97]}]},{"pos":[408,488],"content":"How to: Configure Workflow Unhandled Exception Behavior with WorkflowServiceHost","linkify":"How to: Configure Workflow Unhandled Exception Behavior with WorkflowServiceHost","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Configure Workflow Unhandled Exception Behavior with WorkflowServiceHost","pos":[0,80]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior&gt;</ph> is a behavior that enables you to specify the action to take if an unhandled exception occurs within a workflow hosted in <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost&gt;</ph>.","pos":[489,758],"source":"The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior> is a behavior that enables you to specify the action to take if an unhandled exception occurs within a workflow hosted in <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowServiceHost>."},{"content":"This topic shows how to configure this behavior in a configuration file.","pos":[759,831]},{"pos":[841,888],"content":"To configure WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior","linkify":"To configure WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior","nodes":[{"content":"To configure WorkflowUnhandledExceptionBehavior","pos":[0,47]}]},{"pos":[898,1136],"content":"Add a &lt;<ph id=\"ph1\">`workflowUnhandledException`</ph>&gt; element in a &lt;<ph id=\"ph2\">`behavior`</ph>&gt; element within a &lt;<ph id=\"ph3\">`serviceBehaviors`</ph>&gt; element, using the <ph id=\"ph4\">`action`</ph> attribute to specify the action to take when an unhandled exception occurs as shown in the following example.","source":"Add a <`workflowUnhandledException`> element in a <`behavior`> element within a <`serviceBehaviors`> element, using the `action` attribute to specify the action to take when an unhandled exception occurs as shown in the following example."},{"pos":[1387,1618],"content":"[!NOTE]\nThe preceding configuration sample is using simplified configuration.
