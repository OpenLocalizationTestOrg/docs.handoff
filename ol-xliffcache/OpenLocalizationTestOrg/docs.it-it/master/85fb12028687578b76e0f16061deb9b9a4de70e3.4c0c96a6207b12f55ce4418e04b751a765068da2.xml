The following code example shows how to print a copy of the current form by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This is a complete code example that contains a `Main` method.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   You do not have permission to access the printer.  \n  \n-   There is no printer installed.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n In order to run this code example, you must have permission to access the printer you use with your computer.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>\n- [How to: Render Images with GDI+](how-to-render-images-with-gdi.md)\n- [How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms](how-to-print-graphics-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,299],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Print a Windows Form\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Forms, printing\"\n  - \"printing [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"printing a form\"\n  - \"printing [Windows Forms], printing a form\"\nms.assetid: c8dff5f8-f56a-4c07-ae31-64643b31f8fc","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Windows Form","nodes":[{"pos":[0,28],"content":"How to: Print a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Windows Form","pos":[0,28]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[306,334],"content":"How to: Print a Windows Form","linkify":"How to: Print a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Print a Windows Form","pos":[0,28]}]},{"content":"As part of the development process, you typically will want to print a copy of your Windows Form.","pos":[335,432]},{"content":"The following code example shows how to print a copy of the current form by using the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[433,575],"source":" The following code example shows how to print a copy of the current form by using the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CopyFromScreen%2A> method."},{"pos":[584,591],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[921,939],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[943,1005],"content":"This is a complete code example that contains a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method.","source":"This is a complete code example that contains a `Main` method."},{"pos":[1014,1032],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The following conditions may cause an exception:","pos":[1036,1084]},{"content":"You do not have permission to access the printer.","pos":[1094,1143]},{"content":"There is no printer installed.","pos":[1153,1183]},{"pos":[1192,1215],"content":".NET Framework Security","linkify":".NET Framework Security","nodes":[{"content":".NET Framework Security","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"In order to run this code example, you must have permission to access the printer you use with your computer.","pos":[1219,1328]},{"pos":[1337,1345],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1396,1463],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Render Images with GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-render-images-with-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Render Images with GDI+](how-to-render-images-with-gdi.md)"},{"pos":[1466,1550],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-print-graphics-in-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Print Graphics in Windows Forms](how-to-print-graphics-in-windows-forms.md)"}]}
