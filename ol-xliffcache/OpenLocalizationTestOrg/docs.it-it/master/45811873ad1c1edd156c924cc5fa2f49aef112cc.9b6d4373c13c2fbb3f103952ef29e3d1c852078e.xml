The operator must take that class or structure as at least one of its operands.  \n  \n An operator must use an instance of a programming element as one of its operands, and only classes and structures have instances. Therefore, you cannot define an operator as part of any other programming element.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33018  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you require an operation on the module, use a [Function Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md) to define a `Function` procedure that performs the operation.  \n  \n-   You can also define a class or structure within the module and define an operator on that class or structure. However, that operator must take an instance of that class or structure as at least one of its operands.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)   \n [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)   \n [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Operators cannot be declared in Modules | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Operators cannot be declared in Modules | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[585,624],"content":"Operators cannot be declared in Modules","linkify":"Operators cannot be declared in Modules","nodes":[{"content":"Operators cannot be declared in Modules","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[625,752],"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)</ept> appears in a module definition.","source":"An [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md) appears in a module definition."},{"content":"You can define an operator as part of a class or a structure that you are defining.","pos":[759,842]},{"content":"The operator must take that class or structure as at least one of its operands.","pos":[843,922]},{"content":"An operator must use an instance of a programming element as one of its operands, and only classes and structures have instances.","pos":[929,1058]},{"content":"Therefore, you cannot define an operator as part of any other programming element.","pos":[1059,1141]},{"pos":[1148,1169],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33018","source":"**Error ID:** BC33018"},{"pos":[1178,1199],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1209,1412],"content":"If you require an operation on the module, use a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Function Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md)</ept> to define a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Function`</ph> procedure that performs the operation.","source":"If you require an operation on the module, use a [Function Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md) to define a `Function` procedure that performs the operation."},{"content":"You can also define a class or structure within the module and define an operator on that class or structure.","pos":[1422,1531]},{"content":"However, that operator must take an instance of that class or structure as at least one of its operands.","pos":[1532,1636]},{"pos":[1645,1653],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1657,1769],"source":"[Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Define an Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1772,1898],"source":" [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>How to: Define a Conversion Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)</ept>","pos":[1901,2046],"source":" [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)"}]}
