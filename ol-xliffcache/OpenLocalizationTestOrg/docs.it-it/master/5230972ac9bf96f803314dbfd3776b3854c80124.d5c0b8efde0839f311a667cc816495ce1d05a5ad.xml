An `#Else` directive is not preceded by a corresponding `#If` or `#ElseIf` directive.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30028  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Check that a preceding `#If` or `#ElseIf` is not separated from this `#Else` by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`.  \n  \n2.  Check that `#Else` is preceded by another `#Else` directive. If it is, either remove `#Else` or change it to an `#ElseIf`.  \n  \n3.  If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [#If...Then...#Else Directives](../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/if-then-else-directives.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,218],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30028\"\n  - \"bc30028\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30028\"\nms.assetid: c6ed34de-d6ed-4227-9880-538055aff20a","nodes":[{"content":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,57],"content":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","nodes":[{"content":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","pos":[0,57]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[225,282],"content":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","linkify":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","nodes":[{"content":"'#Else' must be preceded by a matching '#If' or '#ElseIf'","pos":[0,57]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`#Else`</ph> is a conditional compilation directive.","pos":[283,330],"source":"`#Else` is a conditional compilation directive."},{"content":"An <ph id=\"ph1\">`#Else`</ph> directive is not preceded by a corresponding <ph id=\"ph2\">`#If`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`#ElseIf`</ph> directive.","pos":[331,416],"source":" An `#Else` directive is not preceded by a corresponding `#If` or `#ElseIf` directive."},{"pos":[423,444],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30028","source":"**Error ID:** BC30028"},{"pos":[453,474],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[484,644],"content":"Check that a preceding <ph id=\"ph1\">`#If`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`#ElseIf`</ph> is not separated from this <ph id=\"ph3\">`#Else`</ph> by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed <ph id=\"ph4\">`#End If`</ph>.","source":"Check that a preceding `#If` or `#ElseIf` is not separated from this `#Else` by an intervening conditional compilation block or an incorrectly placed `#End If`."},{"content":"Check that <ph id=\"ph1\">`#Else`</ph> is preceded by another <ph id=\"ph2\">`#Else`</ph> directive.","pos":[654,714],"source":"Check that `#Else` is preceded by another `#Else` directive."},{"content":"If it is, either remove <ph id=\"ph1\">`#Else`</ph> or change it to an <ph id=\"ph2\">`#ElseIf`</ph>.","pos":[715,776],"source":" If it is, either remove `#Else` or change it to an `#ElseIf`."},{"pos":[786,895],"content":"If everything else is in order, add an <ph id=\"ph1\">`#If`</ph> directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block.","source":"If everything else is in order, add an `#If` directive to the beginning of the conditional compilation block."},{"pos":[904,912],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[916,1024],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#If...Then...#Else Directives<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/if-then-else-directives.md)</ept>","source":"[#If...Then...#Else Directives](../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/if-then-else-directives.md)"}]}
