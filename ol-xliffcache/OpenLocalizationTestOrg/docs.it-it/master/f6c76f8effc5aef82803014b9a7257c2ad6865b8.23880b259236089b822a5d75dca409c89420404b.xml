This makes testing for string equality more intuitive. For example:\n\n```csharp\nstring a = \"hello\";\nstring b = \"h\";\n// Append to contents of 'b'\nb += \"ello\";\nConsole.WriteLine(a == b);\nConsole.WriteLine((object)a == (object)b);\n```\n\nThis displays \"True\" and then \"False\" because the content of the strings are equivalent, but `a` and `b` do not refer to the same string instance.\n\nThe + operator concatenates strings:\n\n```csharp\nstring a = \"good \" + \"morning\";\n```\n\nThis creates a string object that contains \"good morning\".\n\nStrings are *immutable*--the contents of a string object cannot be changed after the object is created, although the syntax makes it appear as if you can do this. For example, when you write this code, the compiler actually creates a new string object to hold the new sequence of characters, and that new object is assigned to b. The string \"h\" is then eligible for garbage collection.\n\n```csharp\nstring b = \"h\";\nb += \"ello\";\n```\n\nThe [] operator can be used for readonly access to individual characters of a `string`:\n\n```csharp\nstring str = \"test\";\nchar x = str[2];  // x = 's';\n```\n\nIn similar fashion, the [] operator can also be used for iterating over each character in a `string`:\n\n```csharp\nstring str = \"test\";\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < str.Length; i++)\n{\n  Console.Write(str[i] + \" \");\n}\n// Output: t e s t\n``` \n\nString literals are of type `string` and can be written in two forms, quoted and @-quoted. Quoted string literals are enclosed in double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```csharp\n\"good morning\"  // a string literal\n```\n\nString literals can contain any character literal. Escape sequences are included. The following example uses escape sequence `\\\\` for backslash, `\\u0066` for the letter f, and `\\n` for newline.\n\n```csharp\nstring a = \"\\\\\\u0066\\n\";\nConsole.WriteLine(a);\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The escape code `\\udddd` (where `dddd` is a four-digit number) represents the Unicode character U+`dddd`. Eight-digit Unicode escape codes are also recognized: `\\Udddddddd`.\n\nVerbatim string literals start with `@` and are also enclosed in double quotation marks. For example:\n\n```csharp\n@\"good morning\"  // a string literal\n```\n\nThe advantage of verbatim strings is that escape sequences are *not* processed, which makes it easy to write, for example, a fully qualified file name:\n\n```csharp\n@\"c:\\Docs\\Source\\a.txt\"  // rather than \"c:\\\\Docs\\\\Source\\\\a.txt\"\n```\n\nTo include a double quotation mark in an @-quoted string, double it:\n\n```csharp\n@\"\"\"Ahoy!\"\" cried the captain.\" // \"Ahoy!\" cried the captain.\n```\n\nFor other uses of the `@` special character, see [@ -- verbatim identifier](../tokens/verbatim.md).\n\nFor more information about strings in C#, see [Strings](../../programming-guide/strings/index.md).\n\n## Example\n\n[!code-csharp[csrefKeywordsTypes#17](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csrefKeywordsTypes/CS/keywordsTypes.cs#17)]  \n\n## C# language specification\n\n[!INCLUDE[CSharplangspec](~/includes/csharplangspec-md.md)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [C# Reference](../index.md)\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../programming-guide/index.md)\n- [Best Practices for Using Strings](../../../standard/base-types/best-practices-strings.md)\n- [C# Keywords](index.md)\n- [Reference Types](reference-types.md)\n- [Value Types](value-types.md)\n- [Basic String Operations](../../../standard/base-types/basic-string-operations.md)\n- [Creating New Strings](../../../standard/base-types/creating-new.md)\n- [Formatting Numeric Results Table](formatting-numeric-results-table.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,306],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"string -
