The type must be namespace-qualified.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n `true` if `expression` is of type T and T is either a base type, or a derived type of `type`; null if `expression` is null at runtime; otherwise, `false`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The expressions `expression IS NOT OF (type)` and `expression IS NOT OF (ONLY type)` are syntactically equivalent to `NOT (expression IS OF (type))` and `NOT (expression IS OF (ONLY type))`, respectively.  \n  \n The following table shows the behavior of `IS OF` operator over some typical- and corner patterns. All exceptions are thrown from the client side before the provider gets invoked:  \n  \n|Pattern|Behavior|  \n|-------------|--------------|  \n|null IS OF (EntityType)|Throws|  \n|null IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  \n|null IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  \n|TREAT (null AS EntityType) IS OF (EntityType)|Returns DBNull|  \n|TREAT (null AS ComplexType) IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  \n|TREAT (null AS RowType) IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  \n|EntityType IS OF (EntityType)|Returns true/false|  \n|ComplexType IS OF (ComplexType)|Throws|  \n|RowType IS OF (RowType)|Throws|  \n  \n## Example  \n The following [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query uses the IS OF operator to determine the type of a query expression, and then uses the TREAT operator to convert an object of the type Course to a collection of objects of the type OnsiteCourse.
