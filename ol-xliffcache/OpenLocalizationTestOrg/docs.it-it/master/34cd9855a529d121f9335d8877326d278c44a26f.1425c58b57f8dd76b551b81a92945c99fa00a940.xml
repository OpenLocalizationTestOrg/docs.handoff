This topic describes how these technologies implement keyboard and message processing to enable smooth interoperation in hybrid applications.  \n  \n This topic contains the following subsections:  \n  \n-   Modeless Forms and Dialog Boxes  \n  \n-   WindowsFormsHost Keyboard and Message Processing  \n  \n-   ElementHost Keyboard and Message Processing  \n  \n## Modeless Forms and Dialog Boxes  \n Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost.EnableWindowsFormsInterop%2A> method on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> element to open a modeless form or dialog box from a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]-based application.  \n  \n Call the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost.EnableModelessKeyboardInterop%2A> method on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control to open a modeless [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] page in a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)]-based application.  \n  \n## WindowsFormsHost Keyboard and Message Processing  \n When hosted by a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]-based application, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] keyboard and message processing consists of the following:  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> class acquires messages from the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] message loop, which is implemented by the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher> class.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> class creates a surrogate [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] message loop to ensure that ordinary [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] keyboard processing occurs.  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> class implements the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink> interface to coordinate focus management with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)].  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> controls register themselves and start their message loops.  \n  \n The following sections describe these parts of the process in more detail.  \n  \n### Acquiring Messages from the WPF Message Loop  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher> class implements the message loop manager for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]. The <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher> class provides hooks to enable external clients to filter messages before [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] processes them.  \n  \n The interoperation implementation handles the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher.ThreadFilterMessage?displayProperty=fullName> event, which enables [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] controls to process messages before [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] controls.  \n  \n### Surrogate Windows Forms Message Loop  \n By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Application?displayProperty=fullName> class contains the primary message loop for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] applications. During interoperation, the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] message loop does not process messages. Therefore, this logic must be reproduced. The handler for the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher.ThreadFilterMessage?displayProperty=fullName> event performs the following steps:  \n  \n1.  Filters the message using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.IMessageFilter> interface.  \n  \n2.  Calls the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.PreProcessMessage%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n3.  Translates and dispatches the message, if it is required.  \n  \n4.  Passes the message to the hosting control, if no other controls process the message.  \n  \n### IKeyboardInputSink Implementation  \n The surrogate message loop handles keyboard management. Therefore, the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink.TabInto%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is the only <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink> member that requires an implementation in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> class.  \n  \n By default, the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost> class returns `false` for its <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndHost.System%23Windows%23Interop%23IKeyboardInputSink%23TabInto%2A> implementation. This prevents tabbing from a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] control to a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> implementation of the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink.TabInto%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method performs the following steps:  \n  \n1.  Finds the first or last [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] control that is contained by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control and that can receive focus. The control choice depends on traversal information.  \n  \n2.  Sets focus to the control and returns `true`.  \n  \n3.  If no control can receive focus, returns `false`.  \n  \n### WindowsFormsHost Registration  \n When the window handle to a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control is created, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control calls an internal static method that registers its presence for the message loop.  \n  \n During registration, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control examines the message loop. If the message loop has not been started, the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher.ThreadFilterMessage?displayProperty=fullName> event handler is created. The message loop is considered to be running when the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.ComponentDispatcher.ThreadFilterMessage?displayProperty=fullName> event handler is attached.  \n  \n When the window handle is destroyed, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control removes itself from registration.  \n  \n## ElementHost Keyboard and Message Processing  \n When hosted by a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] application, [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] keyboard and message processing consists of the following:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource>, <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink>, and <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSite> interface implementations.  \n  \n-   Tabbing and arrow keys.  \n  \n-   Command keys and dialog box keys.  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] accelerator processing.  \n  \n The following sections describe these parts in more detail.  \n  \n### Interface Implementations  \n In [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)], keyboard messages are routed to the window handle of the control that has focus. In the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control, these messages are routed to the hosted element. To accomplish this, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control provides an <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> instance. If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control has focus, the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> instance routes most keyboard input so that it can be processed by the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Input.InputManager> class.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> class implements the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink> and <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSite> interfaces.  \n  \n Keyboard interoperation relies on implementing the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSite.OnNoMoreTabStops%2A> method to handle TAB key and arrow key input that moves focus out of hosted elements.  \n  \n### Tabbing and Arrow Keys  \n The [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] selection logic is mapped to the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource.System%23Windows%23Interop%23IKeyboardInputSink%23TabInto%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSite.OnNoMoreTabStops%2A> methods to implement TAB and arrow key navigation. Overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost.Select%2A> method accomplishes this mapping.  \n  \n### Command Keys and Dialog Box Keys  \n To give [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] the first opportunity to process command keys and dialog keys, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] command preprocessing is connected to the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink.TranslateAccelerator%2A> method. Overriding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ProcessCmdKey%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method connects the two technologies.  \n  \n With the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink.TranslateAccelerator%2A> method, the hosted elements can handle any key message, such as WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP, WM_SYSKEYDOWN, or WM_SYSKEYUP, including command keys, such as TAB, ENTER, ESC, and arrow keys. If a key message is not handled, it is sent up the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] ancestor hierarchy for handling.  \n  \n### Accelerator Processing  \n To process accelerators correctly, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] accelerator processing must be connected to the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager> class. Additionally, all WM_CHAR messages must be correctly routed to hosted elements.  \n  \n Because the default <xref:System.Windows.Interop.HwndSource> implementation of the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.IKeyboardInputSink.TranslateChar%2A> method returns `false`, WM_CHAR messages are processed using the following logic:  \n  \n-   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputChar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method is overridden to ensure that all WM_CHAR messages are forwarded to hosted elements.  \n  \n-   If the ALT key is pressed, the message is WM_SYSCHAR. [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] does not preprocess this message through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.IsInputChar%2A> method. Therefore, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ProcessMnemonic%2A> method is overridden to query the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager> for a registered accelerator. If a registered accelerator is found, <xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager> processes it.  \n  \n-   If the ALT key is not pressed, the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] <xref:System.Windows.Input.InputManager> class processes the unhandled input. If the input is an accelerator, the <xref:System.Windows.Input.AccessKeyManager> processes it. The <xref:System.Windows.Input.InputManager.PostProcessInput> event is handled for WM_CHAR messages that were not processed.  \n  \n When the user presses the ALT key, accelerator visual cues are shown on the whole form. To support this behavior, all <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls on the active form receive WM_SYSKEYDOWN messages, regardless of which control has focus.  \n  \n Messages are sent only to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> controls in the active form.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
