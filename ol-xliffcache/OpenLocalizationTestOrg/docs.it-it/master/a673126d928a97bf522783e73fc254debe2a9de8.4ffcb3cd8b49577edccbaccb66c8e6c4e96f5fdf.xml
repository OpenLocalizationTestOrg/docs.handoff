It is also known as selection.  \n  \n The following illustration shows the results of filtering a sequence of characters. The predicate for the filtering operation specifies that the character must be 'A'.  \n  \n ![Diagram that shows a LINQ filtering operation](./media/filtering-data/linq-filter-operation.png)  \n  \n The standard query operator methods that perform selection are listed in the following section.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method Name|Description|Visual Basic Query Expression Syntax|More Information|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------|  \n|OfType|Selects values, depending on their ability to be cast to a specified type.|Not applicable.|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.OfType%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n|Where|Selects values that are based on a predicate function.|`Where`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Where%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Where%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n  \n## Query Expression Syntax Example  \n The following example uses the `Where` to filter from an array those strings that have a specific length.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim words() As String = {\"the\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\"}  \n  \nDim query = From word In words   \n            Where word.Length = 3   \n            Select word  \n  \nDim sb As New System.Text.StringBuilder()  \nFor Each str As String In query  \n    sb.AppendLine(str)  \nNext  \n  \n' Display the results.  \nMsgBox(sb.ToString())  \n  \n' This code produces the following output:  \n  \n' the  \n' fox  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Linq>\n- [Standard Query Operators Overview (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/standard-query-operators-overview.md)\n-
