If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one column, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> attached property to specify the number of columns. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment> or <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment> (which alignment you set depends on which two rows you want to resize). Finally, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment>.  \n  \n The following example shows how to define a horizontal <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that resizes adjacent rows.  \n  \n [!code-xml[GridSplitterRowColumn#GridSplitterRowOverlay](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterRowColumn/CS/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterrowoverlay)]  \n  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that does not occupy its own row may be obscured by other controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>.

If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one column, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> attached property to the number of columns.
