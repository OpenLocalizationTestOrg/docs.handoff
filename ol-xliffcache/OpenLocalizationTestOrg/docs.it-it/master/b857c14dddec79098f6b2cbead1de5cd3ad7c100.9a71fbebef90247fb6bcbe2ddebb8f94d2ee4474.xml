File](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/removing-the-view-state-the-designer-adds-to-an-xaml-file.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a class that derives from

Tree](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/programming-model-item-tree.md)  \n Demonstrates how to navigate the <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.Model.ModelItem> tree using declarative data binding from the [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)] Tree View.  \n  \n [Property Grid Extensibliity](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/property-grid-extensibliity.md)  \n Demonstrates how to customize the property grid that is displayed when a given activity is selected within the designer.  \n  \n [Toolbox Service](../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/samples/toolbox-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to update the [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)] Toolbox activities based on the context of the workflow.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,37],"content":"Designer | Microsoft
