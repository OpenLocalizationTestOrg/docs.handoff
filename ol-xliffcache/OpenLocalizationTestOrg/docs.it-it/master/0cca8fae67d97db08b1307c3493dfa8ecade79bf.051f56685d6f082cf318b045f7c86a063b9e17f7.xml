The following example removes the binding from the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock.TextProperty> of *mytext*, a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> object.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[CodeOnlyBinding#ClearBinding](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CodeOnlyBinding/CSharp/binding.cs#clearbinding)]\n [!code-vb[CodeOnlyBinding#ClearBinding](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/CodeOnlyBinding/VisualBasic/App.vb#clearbinding)]  \n  \n Clearing the binding removes the binding so that the value of the dependency property is changed to whatever it would have been without the binding.
