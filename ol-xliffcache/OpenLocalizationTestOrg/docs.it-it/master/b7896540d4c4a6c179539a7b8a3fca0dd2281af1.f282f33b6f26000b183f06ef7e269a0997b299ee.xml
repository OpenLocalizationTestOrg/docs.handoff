The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control is generally used for editable text, although it can also be made read-only. Text boxes can display multiple lines, wrap text to the size of the control, and add basic formatting. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> control provides a single format style for text displayed or entered into the control. To display multiple types of formatted text, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox> control. For more information, see [RichTextBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/richtextbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n## Working with the TextBox Control  \n The text displayed by the control is contained in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property. By default, you can enter up to 2048 characters in a text box. If you set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Multiline%2A> property to `true`, you can enter up to 32 KB of text. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property can be set at design time with the Properties Window, at run time in code, or by user input at run time. The current contents of a text box can be retrieved at run time by reading the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox.Text%2A> property.  \n  \n The following code example sets text in the control at run time. The`InitializeMyControl` procedure will not execute automatically; it must be called.  \n  \n```vb  \nPrivate Sub InitializeMyControl()  \n   ' Put some text into the control first.  \n   TextBox1.Text = \"This is a TextBox control.\"  \nEnd Sub  \n  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nprivate void InitializeMyControl() {  \n   // Put some text into the control first.  \n   textBox1.Text = \"This is a TextBox control.\";  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n```cpp  \nprivate:  \n   void InitializeMyControl()  \n   {  \n      // Put some text into the control first.  \n      textBox1->Text = \"This is a TextBox control.\";  \n   }  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>   \n [How to: Control the Insertion Point in a Windows Forms TextBox
