Deploy apps to servers or desktops and publish to app stores for deployment on mobile devices. .NET is accessible to students and hobbyists, and all are welcome to participate in a lively international developer community and make direct contributions to many of the .NET technologies.\n\n## News\n\nFor news about .NET, check the following blogs:\n\n- [.NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/)\n- [ASP.NET Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/)\n- [The Visual Studio Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/)\n- [The Visual Basic Team](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/vbteam/)\n\nAlso follow the latest .NET events:\n\n- [Microsoft Connect()](https://www.microsoft.com/connectevent)\n- [Microsoft Build 2018](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2018)\n- [.NET Conf](https://www.dotnetconf.net/)\n\nFor information about the latest features added to the .NET implementations and supported languages, see the following articles:\n\n- [What's new in .NET Core](core/whats-new/index.md)\n- [What's new in the .NET Framework](framework/whats-new/index.md)\n- [What's new in C#](csharp/whats-new/index.md)\n- [What's new for Visual Basic](visual-basic/getting-started/whats-new.md)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis documentation covers the breadth of .NET across platforms and languages. You can get started with .NET and its languages in any of the following sections:\n\n- [.NET Guide](standard/index.md)\n- [.NET Core Guide](core/index.md)\n- [.NET Framework Guide](framework/index.md)\n- [C# Guide](csharp/index.md)\n- [F# Guide](fsharp/index.md)\n- [Visual Basic Guide](visual-basic/index.md)\n- [ML.NET Guide](machine-learning/index.md)\n\nAdditionally, you can browse the [.NET API reference](/dotnet/api).\n\n## Open source\n\nThis documentation is completely [open source](https://github.com/dotnet/docs). You can contribute in any way you like, from creating issues to writing documentation. Additionally, much of .NET itself is also open source. The following list shows the main .NET GitHub repositories:\n\n- [.NET Core Home](https://github.com/dotnet/core)\n- [.NET Libraries](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)\n- [.NET Core
