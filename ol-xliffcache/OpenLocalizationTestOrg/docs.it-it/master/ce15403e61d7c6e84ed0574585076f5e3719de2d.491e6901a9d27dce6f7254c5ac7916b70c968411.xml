One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim divisor = 3  \n' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(divisor <> 0, number \\ divisor, \"Division by zero\"))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33106  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.  \n  \n-   Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)   \n [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)   \n [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,118],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &amp;#39;If&amp;#39; operator | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,106],"source":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[634,723],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator","linkify":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &amp;#39;If&amp;#39; operator","pos":[0,89],"source":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the &#39;If&#39; operator"}]},{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the second and third operands of the 'If' operator.","pos":[724,806]},{"content":"One must have a widening conversion to the other.","pos":[807,856]},{"content":"When the <ph id=\"ph1\">`If`</ph> operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments.","pos":[863,993],"source":"When the `If` operator is called with three arguments, there must be a widening conversion between the second and third arguments."},{"content":"For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between <ph id=\"ph1\">`Integer`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`String`</ph>, the following code causes this error.","pos":[994,1139],"source":" For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error."},{"pos":[1274,1295],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33106","source":"**Error ID:** BC33106"},{"pos":[1304,1325],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code.","pos":[1335,1424]},{"pos":[1434,1514],"content":"Use a different condition construction, such as an <ph id=\"ph1\">`If...Then...Else`</ph> statement.","source":"Use a different condition construction, such as an `If...Then...Else` statement."},{"pos":[1523,1531],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1535,1613],"source":"[If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1616,1722],"source":" [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Widening and Narrowing Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)</ept>","pos":[1725,1867],"source":" [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)"}]}
