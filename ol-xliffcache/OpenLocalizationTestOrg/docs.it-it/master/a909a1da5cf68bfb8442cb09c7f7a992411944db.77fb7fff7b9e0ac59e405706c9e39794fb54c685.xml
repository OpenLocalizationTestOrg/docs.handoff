For more information about Unicode, see the [Unicode consortium Web site](http://www.unicode.org).  \n  \n## Benefits of Unicode  \n The benefits of Unicode-enabled forms include the ability to work with scripts that are Unicode-only, such as Hindi. In addition, you can use multiple languages on a single form. In Unicode, all characters are two bytes long, so no special effort is needed to represent double-byte characters. You can also write a single set of code that will work on all platforms. This is a change from previous versions of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], in which you had to write different code for different platforms, such as Windows NT and [!INCLUDE[win98](../../../../includes/win98-md.md)].  \n  \n However, certain controls do not support Unicode in [!INCLUDE[win98](../../../../includes/win98-md.md)] and Windows Millennium Edition. These controls, all of which inherit from the common control, will process data with the Windows code pages, as [!INCLUDE[vcpransi](../../../../includes/vcpransi-md.md)]. These controls are: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DateTimePicker>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MonthCalendar>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ProgressBar>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImageList>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar>. As a result, you cannot display Unicode data in these controls on the listed platforms. For example, you cannot display Japanese characters on an English [!INCLUDE[win98](../../../../includes/win98-md.md)] operating system.  \n  \n For Unicode-aware alternatives to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolBar> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusBar> controls, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> controls, which replace these older controls. To maintain a similar look and feel between visual elements in your application, use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> control for rendering menus instead of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MainMenu>. Like <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.MenuStrip> can also process and display Unicode characters.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
