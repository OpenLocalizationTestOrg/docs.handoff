The expression takes the following form, where `p` is a pointer type:  \n  \n```  \n*p;  \n```  \n  \n You cannot use the unary indirection operator on an expression of any type other than the pointer type. Also, you cannot apply it to a [void](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/void.md) pointer.  \n  \n When you apply the indirection operator to a [null](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/null.md) pointer, the result depends on the implementation.  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, a variable of the type `char` is accessed by using pointers of different types. Note that the address of `theChar` will vary from run to run, because the physical address allocated to a variable can change.  \n  \n
