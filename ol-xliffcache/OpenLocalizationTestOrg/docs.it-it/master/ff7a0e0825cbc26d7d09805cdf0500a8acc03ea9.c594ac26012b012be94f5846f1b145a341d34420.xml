This is usually due to an invalid key file name, an invalid key file path, or a corrupt key file.  \n  \n To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.  \n  \n For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md), [/keyfile (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/keyfile-compiler-option.md) and [/delaysign (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/delaysign-compiler-option.md).  \n  \n When creating an assembly, the C# compiler calls into a utility called al.exe. If there is a failure in the assembly creation, the reason for the failure is reported by al.exe. See [Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md#errors-and-warnings) and search that topic for the text reported by the compiler in 'reason'.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1548\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1548\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1548\"\nms.assetid: 63a467fa-d85f-4876-a8c9-2ae5fdebebab","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1548","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1548","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1548","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1548","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1548","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1548","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Cryptographic failure while signing assembly 'assembly' — 'reason'","pos":[194,260]},{"content":"CS1548 occurs when assembly signing fails.","pos":[267,309]},{"content":"This is usually due to an invalid key file name, an invalid key file path, or a corrupt key file.","pos":[310,407]},{"content":"To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys.","pos":[414,535]},{"content":"To delay sign an assembly, you must select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Delay sign only<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information.","pos":[536,701],"source":" To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information."},{"content":"The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.","pos":[702,768]},{"pos":[775,1160],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>/keyfile (C# Compiler Options)<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/keyfile-compiler-option.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>/delaysign (C# Compiler Options)<ept id=\"p3\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/delaysign-compiler-option.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md), [/keyfile (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/keyfile-compiler-option.md) and [/delaysign (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/delaysign-compiler-option.md)."},{"content":"When creating an assembly, the C# compiler calls into a utility called al.exe.","pos":[1167,1245]},{"content":"If there is a failure in the assembly creation, the reason for the failure is reported by al.exe.","pos":[1246,1343]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md#errors-and-warnings)</ept> and search that topic for the text reported by the compiler in 'reason'.","pos":[1344,1526],"source":" See [Al.exe Tool Errors and Warnings](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md#errors-and-warnings) and search that topic for the text reported by the compiler in 'reason'."},{"pos":[1535,1543],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1547,1670],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)"}]}
