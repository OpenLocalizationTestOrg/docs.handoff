Windows Forms support two different types of Help, each provided by the [HelpProvider Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md). The first involves pointing the user to a Help file of either HTML or HTML Help 1.*x* or greater format. The second can display brief \"What's This\"-type Help on individual controls; this is especially useful on dialog boxes. Both types of Help can be used on the same form.  \n  \n Additionally, the [ToolTip Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/tooltip-component-windows-forms.md) can be used to provide individual Help for controls on Windows Forms.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Provide Help in a Windows Application](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-provide-help-in-a-windows-application.md)  \n Explains how to use the `HelpProvider` component to link controls to files in a Help system.  \n  \n [How to: Display Pop-up Help](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-display-pop-up-help.md)  \n Explains how to use the `HelpProvider` component to show pop-up Help on Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Control Help Using ToolTips](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/control-help-using-tooltips.md)  \n Describes using the `ToolTip` component to show control-specific Help.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [HelpProvider Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains the basics of the `HelpProvider` component.  \n  \n [ToolTip Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/tooltip-component-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains the basics of the `ToolTip` component.  \n  \n [Windows Forms Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/windows-forms-overview.md)  \n Explains the basics of Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/index.md)  \n Provides an overview of Windows Forms.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[696,734],"content":"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms","linkify":"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"Integrating User Help in Windows Forms","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"An essential, but often overlooked, aspect of building Windows-based applications is the Help system, as this is where users turn for assistance in times of confusion.","pos":[735,902]},{"content":"Windows Forms support two different types of Help, each provided by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>HelpProvider Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md)</ept>.","pos":[903,1086],"source":" Windows Forms support two different types of Help, each provided by the [HelpProvider Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/helpprovider-component-windows-forms.md)."},{"content":"The first involves pointing the user to a Help file of either HTML or HTML Help 1.<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>x<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> or greater format.","pos":[1087,1191],"source":" The first involves pointing the user to a Help file of either HTML or HTML Help 1.*x* or greater format."},{"content":"The second can display brief \"What's This\"-type Help on individual controls;
