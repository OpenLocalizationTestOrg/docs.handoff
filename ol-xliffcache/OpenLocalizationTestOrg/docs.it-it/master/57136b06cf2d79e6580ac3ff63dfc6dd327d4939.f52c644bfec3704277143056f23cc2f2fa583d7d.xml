This is equivalent to setting the `enabled` attribute of the `<UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm>` element to `0`. This is the hashing algorithm used in the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../../../../../includes/net-v40-short-md.md)].  \n  \n The <xref:System.StringComparer> class and the <xref:System.String.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method can also use a different hashing algorithm that computes hash codes on a per application domain basis. As a result, hash codes for equivalent strings will differ across application domains. This is an opt-in feature; to take advantage of it, you must set the `enabled` attribute of the `<UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm>` element to `1`.  \n  \n The string lookup in a hash table is typically an O(1) operation. However, when a large number of collisions occur, the lookup can become an O(n<sup>2</sup>) operation. You can use the `<UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm>` configuration element to generate a random hashing algorithm per application domain, which in turn limits the number of potential collisions, particularly when the keys from which the hash codes are calculated are based on data input by users.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example defines a `DisplayString` class that includes a private string constant, `s`, whose value is \"This is a string.\" It also includes a `ShowStringHashCode` method that displays the string value and its hash code along with the name of the application domain in which the method is executing.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.String.GetHashCode#2](../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.GetHashCode/CS/perdomain.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[System.String.GetHashCode#2](../../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR_System/system.String.GetHashCode/VB/perdomain.vb#2)]  \n  \n When you run the example without supplying a configuration file, it displays output similar to the following. Note that the hash codes for the string are identical in the two application domains.  \n  \n```  \n  \nString 'This is a string.' in domain 'PerDomain.exe': 941BCEAC  \nString 'This is a string.' in domain 'NewDomain': 941BCEAC  \n  \n```  \n  \n However, if you add the following configuration file to the example's directory and then run the example, the hash codes for the same string will differ by application domain.  \n  \n```  \n  \n<?xml version =\"1.0\"?>  \n<configuration>  \n   <runtime>  \n      <UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm enabled=\"1\" />  \n   </runtime>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n  \n When the configuration file is present, the example displays the following output:  \n  \n```  \n  \nString 'This is a string.' in domain 'PerDomain.exe': 5435776D  \nString 'This is a string.' in domain 'NewDomain': 75CC8236  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.StringComparer.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.String.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A?displayProperty=fullName>","nodes":[{"pos":[4,549],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"&lt;UseRandomizedStringHashAlgorithm&gt;
