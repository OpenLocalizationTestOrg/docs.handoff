You can reduce this space to accommodate times when there is a heavy load on system memory. Reducing this committed space improves performance and expands the capacity to host more sites.  \n  \n When the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting is enabled, the garbage collector evaluates the system memory load and enters a trimming mode when the load reaches 90%. It maintains the trimming mode until the load drops under 85%.  \n  \n When conditions permit, the garbage collector can decide that the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting will not help the current application and ignore it.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following XML fragment shows how to enable the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting. Ellipses indicate other settings that would be in the `runtime` node.  \n  \n```  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>  \n<configuration>  \n    <runtime>  \n    . . .  \n    <gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory enabled=\"true\"/>  \n    </runtime>  \n    . . .  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Garbage Collection](../../../docs/standard/garbage-collection/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,64],"content":"Optimization for Shared Web Hosting | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Optimization for Shared Web Hosting | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,52]}]},{"pos":[497,532],"content":"Optimization for Shared Web Hosting","linkify":"Optimization for Shared Web Hosting","nodes":[{"content":"Optimization for Shared Web Hosting","pos":[0,35]}]},{"pos":[533,810],"content":"If you are the administrator for a server that is shared by hosting several small Web sites, you can optimize performance and increase site capacity by adding the following <ph id=\"ph1\">`gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory`</ph> setting to the <ph id=\"ph2\">`runtime`</ph> node in the Aspnet.config file in the .NET directory:","source":"If you are the administrator for a server that is shared by hosting several small Web sites, you can optimize performance and increase site capacity by adding the following `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting to the `runtime` node in the Aspnet.config file in the .NET directory:"},{"pos":[874,951],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This setting is recommended only for shared Web hosting scenarios.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"This setting is recommended only for shared Web hosting scenarios.","pos":[9,75]}]},{"content":"Because the garbage collector retains memory for future allocations, its committed space can be more than what is strictly needed.","pos":[958,1088]},{"content":"You can reduce this space to accommodate times when there is a heavy load on system memory.","pos":[1089,1180]},{"content":"Reducing this committed space improves performance and expands the capacity to host more sites.","pos":[1181,1276]},{"content":"When the <ph id=\"ph1\">`gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory`</ph> setting is enabled, the garbage collector evaluates the system memory load and enters a trimming mode when the load reaches 90%.","pos":[1283,1446],"source":"When the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting is enabled, the garbage collector evaluates the system memory load and enters a trimming mode when the load reaches 90%."},{"content":"It maintains the trimming mode until the load drops under 85%.","pos":[1447,1509]},{"pos":[1516,1668],"content":"When conditions permit, the garbage collector can decide that the <ph id=\"ph1\">`gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory`</ph> setting will not help the current application and ignore it.","source":"When conditions permit, the garbage collector can decide that the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting will not help the current application and ignore it."},{"pos":[1677,1684],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following XML fragment shows how to enable the <ph id=\"ph1\">`gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory`</ph> setting.","pos":[1688,1773],"source":"The following XML fragment shows how to enable the `gcTrimCommitOnLowMemory` setting."},{"content":"Ellipses indicate other settings that would be in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`runtime`</ph> node.","pos":[1774,1843],"source":" Ellipses indicate other settings that would be in the `runtime` node."},{"pos":[2050,2058],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2062,2134],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Garbage Collection<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/garbage-collection/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Garbage Collection](../../../docs/standard/garbage-collection/index.md)"}]}
