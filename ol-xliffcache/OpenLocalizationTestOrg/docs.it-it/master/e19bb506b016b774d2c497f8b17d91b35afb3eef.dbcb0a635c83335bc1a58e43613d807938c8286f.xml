If you compile from the default Windows Command Prompt, you must type the fully qualified path to the executable file. To override this default behavior, you can either use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Command Prompt, or modify the PATH environment variable. Both allow you to compile from any directory by simply typing the compiler name.  \n  \n[!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  \n  \n### To invoke the compiler using the Visual Studio Command Prompt  \n  \n1.  Open the Visual Studio Tools program folder within the Microsoft Visual Studio program group.  \n  \n2.  You can use the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Command Prompt to access the compiler from any directory on your machine, if Visual Studio is installed.  \n  \n3.  Invoke the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Command Prompt.  \n  \n4.  At the command line, type `vbc.exe` *sourceFileName* and then press ENTER.  \n  \n     For example, if you stored your source code in a directory called `SourceFiles`, you would open the Command Prompt and type `cd SourceFiles` to change to that directory. If the directory contained a source file named `Source.vb`, you could compile it by typing `vbc.exe Source.vb`.  \n  \n### To set the PATH environment variable to the compiler for the Windows Command Prompt  \n  \n1.  Use the Windows Search feature to find Vbc.exe on your local disk.  \n  \n     The exact name of the directory where the compiler is located depends on the location of the Windows directory and the version of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] installed. If you have more than one version of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/includes/compact_md.md)] installed, you must determine which version to use (typically the latest version).  \n  \n2.  From your **Start** Menu, right-click **My Computer**, and then click **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  \n  \n3.  Click the **Advanced** tab, and then click **Environment Variables**.  \n  \n4.  In the **System** variables pane, select **Path** from the list and click **Edit**.  \n  \n5.  In the **Edit System** Variable dialog box, move the insertion point to the end of the string in the **Variable Value** field and type a semicolon (;) followed by the full directory name found in Step 1.  \n  \n6.  Click **OK** to confirm your edits and close the dialog boxes.  \n  \n     After you change the PATH environment variable, you can run the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] compiler at the Windows Command Prompt from any directory on the computer.  \n  \n### To invoke the compiler using the Windows Command Prompt  \n  \n1.  From the **Start** menu, click on the **Accessories** folder, and then open the **Windows Command Prompt**.  \n  \n2.  At the command line, type `vbc.exe`*sourceFileName* and then press ENTER.  \n  \n     For example, if you stored your source code in a directory called `SourceFiles`, you would open the Command Prompt and type `cd SourceFiles` to change to that directory. If the directory contained a source file named `Source.vb`, you could compile it by typing `vbc.exe Source.vb`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Visual Basic Command-Line
