The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> class provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A> static methods so that you can determine which image decoders are available. <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A> returns an array of <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> objects.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example outputs the list of installed decoders and their property values.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#2](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/CS/Form1.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[UsingImageEncodersDecoders#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/UsingImageEncodersDecoders/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A Windows Forms application.  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: List Installed Encoders](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)\n- [Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,261],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: List Installed Decoders\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"image codecs [Windows Forms], listing\"\n  - \"image decoders [Windows Forms], listing\"\nms.assetid: 11417191-8c95-40ca-8024-779e61706fb6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Decoders","nodes":[{"pos":[0,31],"content":"How to: List Installed Decoders","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Decoders","pos":[0,31]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[268,299],"content":"How to: List Installed Decoders","linkify":"How to: List Installed Decoders","nodes":[{"content":"How to: List Installed Decoders","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"You may want to list the image decoders available on a computer, to determine whether your application can read a particular image file format.","pos":[300,443]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo&gt;</ph> class provides the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A&gt;</ph> static methods so that you can determine which image decoders are available.","pos":[444,653],"source":" The <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> class provides the <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A> static methods so that you can determine which image decoders are available."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A&gt;</ph> returns an array of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo&gt;</ph> objects.","pos":[654,792],"source":"<xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders%2A> returns an array of <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageCodecInfo> objects."},{"pos":[801,808],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example outputs the list of installed decoders and their property values.","pos":[812,904]},{"pos":[1189,1207],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"This example requires:","pos":[1211,1233]},{"content":"A Windows Forms application.","pos":[1243,1271]},{"pos":[1281,1397],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1406,1414],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1418,1486],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: List Installed Encoders<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: List Installed Encoders](how-to-list-installed-encoders.md)"},{"pos":[1489,1593],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Image Encoders and Decoders in Managed GDI+](using-image-encoders-and-decoders-in-managed-gdi.md)"}]}
