The primary purpose of a window is to host content that visualizes data and enables users to interact with data. Standalone              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications provide their own windows by using the              <xref:System.Windows.Window> class. This topic introduces              <xref:System.Windows.Window> before covering the fundamentals of creating and managing windows in standalone applications.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Browser-hosted                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications, including                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] and loose                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] pages, don't provide their own windows. Instead, they are hosted in windows provided by                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iegeneric](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iegeneric-md.md)]. See                  [WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md).  \n  \n  \n<a name=\"TheWindowClass\"></a>   \n## The Window Class  \n The following figure illustrates the constituent parts of a window.  \n  \n ![Window elements](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/windowoverviewfigure1.PNG \"WindowOverviewFigure1\")  \n  \n A window is divided into two areas: the non-client area and client area.  \n  \n The                  *non-client area* of a window is implemented by                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] and includes the parts of a window that are common to most windows, including the following:  \n  \n-   A border.  \n  \n-   A title bar.  \n  \n-   An icon.  \n  \n-   Minimize, Maximize, and Restore buttons.  \n  \n-   A Close button.  \n  \n-   A System menu with menu items that allow users to minimize, maximize, restore, move, resize, and close a window.  \n  \n The                  *client area* of a window is the area within a window's non-client area and is used by developers to add application-specific content, such as menu bars, tool bars, and controls.  \n  \n In                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], a window is encapsulated by the                  <xref:System.Windows.Window> class that you use to do the following:  \n  \n-   Display a window.  \n  \n-   Configure the size, position, and appearance of a window.  \n  \n-   Host application-specific content.  \n  \n-   Manage the lifetime of a window.  \n  \n<a name=\"DefiningAWindow\"></a>   \n## Implementing a Window  \n The implementation of a typical window comprises both appearance and behavior, where                  *appearance* defines how a window looks to users and                  *behavior* defines the way a window functions as users interact with it. In                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], you can implement the appearance and behavior of a window using either code or                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup.  \n  \n In general, however, the appearance of a window is implemented using                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup, and its behavior is implemented using code-behind, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WindowsOverviewSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml#markupandcodebehindwindowmarkup)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WindowsOverviewSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml.cs#markupandcodebehindwindowcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[WindowsOverviewSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/VisualBasic/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml.vb#markupandcodebehindwindowcodebehind)]  \n  \n To enable a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup file and code-behind file to work together, the following are required:  \n  \n-   In markup, the                          `Window` element must include the                          `x:Class` attribute. When the application is built, the existence of                          `x:Class` in the markup file causes                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] to create a                          `partial` class that derives from                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> and has the name that is specified by the                          `x:Class` attribute. This requires the addition of an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] namespace declaration for the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] schema (                          `xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"` ). The generated                          `partial` class implements the                          `InitializeComponent` method, which is called to register the events and set the properties that are implemented in markup.  \n  \n-   In code-behind, the class must be a                          `partial` class with the same name that is specified by the                          `x:Class` attribute in markup, and it must derive from                          <xref:System.Windows.Window>. This allows the code-behind file to be associated with the                          `partial` class that is generated for the markup file when the application is built (see                          [Building a WPF Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/building-a-wpf-application-wpf.md)).  \n  \n-   In code-behind, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window> class must implement a constructor that calls the                          `InitializeComponent` method.                          `InitializeComponent` is implemented by the markup file's generated                          `partial` class to register events and set properties that are defined in markup.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When you add a new                      <xref:System.Windows.Window> to your project by using                      [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)], the                      <xref:System.Windows.Window> is implemented using both markup and code-behind, and includes the necessary configuration to create the association between the markup and code-behind files as described here.  \n  \n With this configuration in place, you can focus on defining the appearance of the window in                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup and implementing its behavior in code-behind. The following example shows a window with a button, implemented in                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup, and an event handler for the button's                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event, implemented in code-behind.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets/CSharp/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml#markupandcodebehindwindowmarkup)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets/CSharp/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml.cs#markupandcodebehindwindowcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets#MarkupAndCodeBehindWindowCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewWindowWithButtonSnippets/VisualBasic/MarkupAndCodeBehindWindow.xaml.vb#markupandcodebehindwindowcodebehind)]  \n  \n<a name=\"ConfiguringWindowForMSBuild\"></a>   \n## Configuring a Window Definition for MSBuild  \n How you implement your window determines how it is configured for                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)].

Additionally, the first window to be instantiated is, by default, set by                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> as the main application window (see                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.MainWindow%2A?displayProperty=fullName>).  \n  \n The window is finally opened by calling the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> method; the result is shown in the following figure.  \n  \n ![A Window Opened by Calling Window.Show](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/windowoverviewfigure8.png \"WindowOverviewFigure8\")  \n  \n A window that is opened by calling                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> is a modeless window, which means that the application operates in a mode that allows users to activate other windows in the same application.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowDialog%2A> is called to open windows such as dialog boxes modally. See                              [Dialog Boxes Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/dialog-boxes-overview.md) for more information.  \n  \n When                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> is called, a window performs initialization work before it is shown to establish infrastructure that allows it to receive user input. When the window is initialized, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.SourceInitialized> event is raised and the window is shown.  \n  \n As a shortcut,                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.StartupUri%2A> can be set to specify the first window that is opened automatically when an application starts.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WindowsOverviewSnippets#ApplicationStartupUriMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml#applicationstartupurimarkup)]  \n  \n When the application starts, the window specified by the value of                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.StartupUri%2A> is opened modelessly; internally, the window is opened by calling its                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> method.  \n  \n<a name=\"Ownership\"></a>   \n#### Window Ownership  \n A window that is opened by using the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> method does not have an implicit relationship with the window that created it; users can interact with either window independently of the other, which means that either window can do the following:  \n  \n-   Cover the other (unless one of the windows has its                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Topmost%2A> property set to                                          `true`).  \n  \n-   Be minimized, maximized, and restored without affecting the other.  \n  \n Some windows require a relationship with the window that opens them. For example, an                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ide](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ide-md.md)] application may open property windows and tool windows whose typical behavior is to cover the window that creates them. Furthermore, such windows should always close, minimize, maximize, and restore in concert with the window that created them. Such a relationship can be established by making one window                                  *own* another, and is achieved by setting the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window.Owner%2A> property of the                                  *owned window* with a reference to the                                  *owner window*. This is shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WindowOwnerOwnedWindowsSnippets#SetWindowOwnerCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowOwnerOwnedWindowsSnippets/CSharp/MainWindow.xaml.cs#setwindowownercode)]\n [!code-vb[WindowOwnerOwnedWindowsSnippets#SetWindowOwnerCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowOwnerOwnedWindowsSnippets/visualbasic/mainwindow.xaml.vb#setwindowownercode)]  \n  \n After ownership is established:  \n  \n-   The owned window can reference its owner window by inspecting the value of its                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Owner%2A> property.  \n  \n-   The owner window can discover all the windows it owns by inspecting the value of its                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.OwnedWindows%2A> property.  \n  \n<a name=\"Preventing\"></a>   \n#### Preventing Window Activation  \n There are scenarios where windows should not be activated when shown, such as conversation windows of an Internet messenger-style application or notification windows of an e-mail application.  \n  \n If your application has a window that shouldn't be activated when shown, you can set its                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowActivated%2A> property to                                  `false` before calling the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Window.Show%2A> method for the first time. As a consequence:  \n  \n-   The window is not activated.  \n  \n-   The window's                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> event is not raised.  \n  \n-   The currently activated window remains activated.  \n  \n The window will become activated, however, as soon as the user activates it by clicking either the client or non-client area. In this case:  \n  \n-   The window is activated.  \n  \n-   The window's                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> event is raised.  \n  \n-   The previously activated window is deactivated.  \n  \n-   The window's                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Deactivated> and                                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> events are subsequently raised as expected in response to user actions.  \n  \n<a name=\"Window_Activation\"></a>   \n### Window Activation  \n When a window is first opened, it becomes the active window (unless it is shown with                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.ShowActivated%2A> set to                          `false`). The                          *active window* is the window that is currently capturing user input, such as key strokes and mouse clicks. When a window becomes active, it raises the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> event.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When a window is first opened, the                              <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> and                              <xref:System.Windows.Window.ContentRendered> events are raised only after the                              <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> event is raised. With this in mind, a window can effectively be considered opened when                              <xref:System.Windows.Window.ContentRendered> is raised.  \n  \n After a window becomes active, a user can activate another window in the same application, or activate another application. When that happens, the currently active window becomes deactivated and raises the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Deactivated> event. Likewise, when the user selects a currently deactivated window, the window becomes active again and                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> is raised.  \n  \n One common reason to handle                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Deactivated> is to enable and disable functionality that can only run when a window is active. For example, some windows display interactive content that requires constant user input or attention, including games and video players. The following example is a simplified video player that demonstrates how to handle                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Activated> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Deactivated> to implement this behavior.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WindowsOverviewSnippets#ActivationDeactivationMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/CustomMediaPlayerWindow.xaml#activationdeactivationmarkup)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WindowsOverviewSnippets#ActivationDeactivationCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/CustomMediaPlayerWindow.xaml.cs#activationdeactivationcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[WindowsOverviewSnippets#ActivationDeactivationCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/VisualBasic/CustomMediaPlayerWindow.xaml.vb#activationdeactivationcodebehind)]  \n  \n Other types of applications may still run code in the background when a window is deactivated. For example, a mail client may continue polling the mail server while the user is using other applications. Applications like these often provide different or additional behavior while the main window is deactivated. With respect to the mail program, this may mean both adding the new mail item to the inbox and adding a notification icon to the system tray.

A window can be closed by using elements in the non-client area, including the following:  \n  \n-   The                                  **Close** item of the                                  **System** menu.  \n  \n-   Pressing ALT+F4.  \n  \n-   Pressing the                                  **Close** button.  \n  \n You can provide additional mechanisms to the client area to close a window, the more common of which include the following:  \n  \n-   An                                  **Exit** item in the                                  **File** menu, typically for main application windows.  \n  \n-   A                                  **Close** item in the                                  **File** menu, typically on a secondary application window.  \n  \n-   A                                  **Cancel** button, typically on a modal dialog box.  \n  \n-   A                                  **Close** button, typically on a modeless dialog box.  \n  \n To close a window in response to one of these custom mechanisms, you need to call the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Close%2A> method. The following example implements the ability to close a window by choosing the                          **Exit** on the                          **File** menu.  \n  \n [!code-xml[WindowsOverviewSnippets#WindowWithFileExitMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/WindowWithFileExit.xaml#windowwithfileexitmarkup)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[WindowsOverviewSnippets#WindowWithFileExitCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/CSharp/WindowWithFileExit.xaml.cs#windowwithfileexitcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[WindowsOverviewSnippets#WindowWithFileExitCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/WindowsOverviewSnippets/VisualBasic/WindowWithFileExit.xaml.vb#windowwithfileexitcodebehind)]  \n  \n When a window closes, it raises two events:                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Closing> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Closed>.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Window.Closing> is raised before the window closes, and it provides a mechanism by which window closure can be prevented. One common reason to prevent window closure is if window content contains modified data. In this situation, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Window.Closing> event can be handled to determine whether data is dirty and, if so, to ask the user whether to either continue closing the window without saving the data or to cancel window closure.
