This method can also be used to read Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code and native JIT-compiled code.  \n  \n Any managed breakpoints will be removed from the data that is returned in the `buffer` parameter. No adjustments will be made for native breakpoints set by [ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md).  \n  \n No caching of process memory is performed.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h  \n  \n **Library:** CorGuids.lib  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,476],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\napi_name: \n  - \"ICorDebugProcess.ReadMemory\"\napi_location: \n  - \"mscordbi.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ReadMemory method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\n  - \"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory method [.NET Framework debugging]\"\nms.assetid: 28e4b2f6-9589-445c-be24-24a3306795e7\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","pos":[0,35]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[483,518],"content":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","linkify":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICorDebugProcess::ReadMemory Method","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"Reads a specified area of memory for this process.","pos":[519,569]},{"pos":[578,584],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[776,786],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] A <ph id=\"ph1\">`CORDB_ADDRESS`</ph> value that specifies the base address of the memory to be read.","pos":[803,889],"source":"[in] A `CORDB_ADDRESS` value that specifies the base address of the memory to be read."},{"content":"[in] The number of bytes to be read from memory.","pos":[906,954]},{"content":"[out] A buffer that receives the contents of the memory.","pos":[973,1029]},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the number of bytes transferred into the specified buffer.","pos":[1046,1123]},{"pos":[1132,1139],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReadMemory`</ph> method is primarily intended to be used by interop debugging to inspect memory regions that are being used by the unmanaged portion of the debuggee.","pos":[1143,1308],"source":"The `ReadMemory` method is primarily intended to be used by interop debugging to inspect memory regions that are being used by the unmanaged portion of the debuggee."},{"content":"This method can also be used to read Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) code and native JIT-compiled code.","pos":[1309,1419]},{"content":"Any managed breakpoints will be removed from the data that is returned in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`buffer`</ph> parameter.","pos":[1426,1523],"source":"Any managed breakpoints will be removed from the data that is returned in the `buffer` parameter."},{"content":"No adjustments will be made for native breakpoints set by <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md)</ept>.","pos":[1524,1729],"source":" No adjustments will be made for native breakpoints set by [ICorDebugProcess2::SetUnmanagedBreakpoint](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/icordebugprocess2-setunmanagedbreakpoint-method.md)."},{"content":"No caching of process memory is performed.","pos":[1736,1778]},{"pos":[1787,1799],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[1803,1907],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[1914,1950],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h","source":"**Header:** CorDebug.idl, CorDebug.h"},{"pos":[1957,1982],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> CorGuids.lib","source":"**Library:** CorGuids.lib"},{"pos":[1989,2097],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]</ph>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]"}]}
