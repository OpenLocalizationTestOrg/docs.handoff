When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> gains keyboard focus, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is changed to red.  When the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> loses keyboard focus, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Control.Background%2A> of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> is changed back to white.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent#GotLostFocusSampleEventHandlers](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#gotlostfocussampleeventhandlers)]\n [!code-vb[gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent#GotLostFocusSampleEventHandlers](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/gotfocusLostfocusEffectUsingEvent/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#gotlostfocussampleeventhandlers)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Input Overview](input-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,331],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Change the Color of an Element Using Focus Events\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
