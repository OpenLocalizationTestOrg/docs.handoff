The <xref:System.Security.Permissions.HostProtectionAttribute> attribute allows the host that runs the code to determine that the code exposes host-protection synchronization.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The <xref:System.Security.Permissions.HostProtectionAttribute> attribute is effective only on unmanaged applications that host the common language runtime and that implement host protection, such as SQL Server.  \n  \n To ensure that `My.Application.Log` uses your log listener, you should strongly name the assembly that contains your log listener.  \n  \n The next procedure provides some simple steps for creating a strongly named log-listener assembly. For more information, see [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/xwb8f617).  \n  \n#### To strongly name the log-listener assembly  \n  \n1.  Have a project selected in **Solution Explorer**. On the **Project** menu, choose **Properties**. For more information, see [Introduction to the Project Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/898dd854-c98d-430c-ba1b-a913ce3c73d7).  \n  \n2.  Click the **Signing** tab.  \n  \n3.  Select the **Sign the assembly** box.  \n  \n4.  Select **\\<New>** from the **Choose a strong name key file** drop-down list.  \n  \n     The **Create Strong Name Key** dialog box opens.  \n  \n5.  Provide a name for the key file in the **Key file name** box.  \n  \n6.  Enter a password in the **Enter password** and **Confirm password** boxes.  \n  \n7.  Click **OK**.  \n  \n8.  Rebuild the application.  \n  \n## Adding the Listener  \n Now that the assembly has a strong name, you need to determine the strong name of the listener so that `My.Application.Log` uses your log listener.  \n  \n The format of a strongly named type is as follows.  \n  \n \\<type name>, \\<assembly name>, \\<version number>, \\<culture>, \\<strong name>  \n  \n#### To determine the strong name of the listener  \n  \n-   The following code shows how to determine the strongly named type name for `SimpleListener`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyApplicationLog#17](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/log-info/codesnippet/VisualBasic/walkthrough-creating-custom-log-listeners_2.vb)]  \n  \n     The strong name of the type depends on your project.  \n  \n With the strong name, you can add the listener to the `My.Application.Log` log-listener collection.  \n  \n#### To add the listener to My.Application.Log  \n  \n1.  Right-click on app.config in the **Solution Explorer** and choose **Open**.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n     If there is an app.config file:  \n  \n    1.  On the **Project** menu, choose **Add New Item**.  \n  \n    2.  From the **Add New Item** dialog box, choose **Application Configuration File**.  \n  \n    3.  Click **Add**.  \n  \n2.  Locate the `<listeners>` section, in the `<source>` section with the `name` attribute \"DefaultSource\", located in the `<sources>` section. The `<sources>` section is located in the `<system.diagnostics>` section, in the top-level `<configuration>` section.  \n  \n3.  Add this element to the `<listeners>` section:  \n  \n    ```  \n    <add name=\"SimpleLog\" />  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  Locate the `<sharedListeners>` section, in the `<system.diagnostics>` section, in the top-level `<configuration>` section.  \n  \n5.  Add this element to that `<sharedListeners>` section:  \n  \n    ```  \n    <add name=\"SimpleLog\" type=\"SimpleLogStrongName\" />  \n    ```  \n  \n     Change the value of `SimpleLogStrongName` to be the strong name of the listener.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Logging.Log?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [Working with Application
