Your application runs as a 64-bit process whenever possible and falls back to 32-bit when only that mode is available.  \n  \n-   **anycpu32bitpreferred** compiles your assembly to run on any platform. Your application runs in 32-bit mode on systems that support both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. You can specify this option only for projects that target the .NET Framework 4.5.  \n  \n-   **ARM** compiles your assembly to run on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor.  \n  \n-   **ARM64** compiles your assembly to run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer that has an Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processor that supports the A64 instruction set.  \n\n-   **x64** compiles your assembly to be run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer that supports the AMD64 or EM64T instruction set.  \n  \n-   **x86** compiles your assembly to be run by the 32-bit, x86-compatible CLR.  \n  \n-   **Itanium** compiles your assembly to be run by the 64-bit CLR on a computer with an Itanium processor.  \n  \n On a 64-bit Windows operating system:  \n  \n-   Assemblies compiled with **-platform:x86** execute on the 32-bit CLR running under WOW64.  \n  \n-   A DLL compiled with the **-platform:anycpu** executes on the same CLR as the process into which it is loaded.  \n  \n-   Executables that are compiled with the **-platform:anycpu** execute on the 64-bit CLR.  \n  \n-   Executables compiled with **-platform:anycpu32bitpreferred** execute on the 32-bit CLR.  \n  \n The **anycpu32bitpreferred** setting is valid only for executable (.EXE) files, and it requires the .NET Framework 4.5.  \n  \n For more information about developing an application to run on a Windows 64-bit operating system, see [64-bit Applications](../../../framework/64-bit-apps.md).  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the **Properties** page for the project.  \n  \n2.  Click the **Build** property page.  \n  \n3.  Modify the **Platform target** property and, for projects that target the .NET Framework 4.5, select or clear the **Prefer 32-bit** check box.  \n  \n **Note -platform** is not available in the development environment in Visual C# Express.  \n  \n For information on how to set this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.CSharpProjectConfigurationProperties3.PlatformTarget%2A>.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to use the **-platform** option to specify that the application should be run by the 64-bit CLR on a 64-bit Windows operating system.  \n  \n```console  \ncsc -platform:anycpu filename.cs  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [C# Compiler Options](index.md)\n- [Managing
