In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages. SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,106],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Service: Calls Faulted\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 6da7f100-3f61-4b3c-9409-fe1360829b8a","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"Service: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Calls Faulted","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[113,135],"content":"Service: Calls Faulted","linkify":"Service: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"content":"Service: Calls Faulted","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted.","pos":[136,164]},{"pos":[173,184],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls to this service that have returned faults.","pos":[188,246]},{"content":"In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[247,386]},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[387,585]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[586,672]},{"pos":[681,689],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[693,846],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
