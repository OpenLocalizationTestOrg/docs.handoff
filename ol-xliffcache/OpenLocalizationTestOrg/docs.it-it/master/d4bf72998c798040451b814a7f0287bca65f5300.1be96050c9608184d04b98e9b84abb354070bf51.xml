[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] text rendering typically offers better performance and more accurate text measuring than [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class are not supported for printing. When printing, always use the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to draw text on multiple lines within a rectangle using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples/CS/Form1.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples#7](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.TextRendererExamples/VB/Form1.vb#7)]  \n  \n To render text with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class, you need an <xref:System.Drawing.IDeviceContext>, such as a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> and a <xref:System.Drawing.Font>, a location to draw the text, and the color in which it should be drawn. Optionally, you can specify the text formatting by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextFormatFlags> enumeration.  \n  \n For more information about obtaining a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, see [How to: Create Graphics Objects for Drawing](how-to-create-graphics-objects-for-drawing.md). For more information about constructing a <xref:System.Drawing.Font>, see [How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts](how-to-construct-font-families-and-fonts.md).  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding code example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Font>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Color>\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Color>\n- [Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,355],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Text with GDI\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"GDI [Windows Forms], drawing text [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], drawing with TextRenderer\"\n  - \"drawing [Windows Forms], text\"\n  - \"Windows Forms, drawing text with GDI\"\nms.assetid: 2a19fe5d-2ace-451c-94db-01cb1118ef7b","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","nodes":[{"pos":[0,26],"content":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","pos":[0,26]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[362,388],"content":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","linkify":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Text with GDI","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"With the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A&gt;</ph> method in the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer&gt;</ph> class, you can access <ph id=\"ph3\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)]</ph> functionality for drawing text on a form or control.","pos":[389,640],"source":"With the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class, you can access [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] functionality for drawing text on a form or control."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)]</ph> text rendering typically offers better performance and more accurate text measuring than <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[641,858],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] text rendering typically offers better performance and more accurate text measuring than [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]."},{"pos":[866,1155],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> class are not supported for printing.
