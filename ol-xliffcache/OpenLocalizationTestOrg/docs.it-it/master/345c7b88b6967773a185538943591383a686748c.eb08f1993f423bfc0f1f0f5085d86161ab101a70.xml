A host might need exclusive control over the size of the thread pool, for reasons such as implementation, performance, or scalability. For this reason, the host is not required to implement `SetMaxThreads`. In this case, a host should return E_NOTIMPL from this method.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n
