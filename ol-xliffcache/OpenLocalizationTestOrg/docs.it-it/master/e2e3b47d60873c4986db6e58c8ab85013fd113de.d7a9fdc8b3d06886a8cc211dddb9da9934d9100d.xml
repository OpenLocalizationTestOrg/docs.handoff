You can provide this functionality in your Windows Forms by handling the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  \n  \n The following procedure requires that you have created a Windows-based application with a <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component on it, which is the standard way of enabling printing from a Windows-based application. For more information about printing from Windows Forms using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Create Standard Windows Forms Print Jobs](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-standard-windows-forms-print-jobs.md).  \n  \n### To complete a print job  \n  \n1.  Set the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.DocumentName%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    PrintDocument1.DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\"  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    printDocument1.DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\";  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    printDocument1->DocumentName = \"MyTextFile\";  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Write code to handle the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.EndPrint> event.  \n  \n     In the following code example, a message box is displayed, indicating that the document has finished printing.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_EndPrint(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.EndPrint  \n       MessageBox.Show(PrintDocument1.DocumentName + \" has finished printing.\")  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void printDocument1_EndPrint(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       MessageBox.Show(printDocument1.DocumentName +   \n          \" has finished printing.\");  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_EndPrint(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          MessageBox::Show(String::Concat(printDocument1->DocumentName,  \n             \" has finished printing.\"));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.EndPrint += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_EndPrint);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->printDocument1->EndPrint += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_EndPrint);  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>   \n [Windows Forms Print Support](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/windows-forms-print-support.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,512],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Complete Windows Forms Print Jobs | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
