As a result, a button moves along a curved path.  \n  \n In addition, the example sets the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.MatrixAnimationUsingPath.IsOffsetCumulative%2A> property to `true`, which causes the offset of the animated matrix to accumulate as the animation repeats. Because the offset accumulates, the button moves farther across the screen when the animation repeats, rather than resetting to the starting position.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[PathAnimationGallery_snippet#MatrixAnimationUsingPathOffsetCumulativeWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_snippet/CS/matrixanimationusingpathexampleoffsetcumulative.xaml#matrixanimationusingpathoffsetcumulativewholepage)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip#MatrixAnimationUsingPathOffsetCumulativeWholePage](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip/CSharp/MatrixAnimationUsingPathExampleOffsetCumulative.cs#matrixanimationusingpathoffsetcumulativewholepage)]\n [!code-vb[PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip#MatrixAnimationUsingPathOffsetCumulativeWholePage](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/PathAnimationGallery_procedural_snip/VisualBasic/MatrixAnimationUsingPathExampleOffsetCumulative.vb#matrixanimationusingpathoffsetcumulativewholepage)]  \n  \n Note that, although the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.MatrixAnimationUsingPath.IsOffsetCumulative%2A> property causes offset values to accumulate over repetitions, it doesn't cause rotation values to accumulate. To make rotation values accumulate, set the animation's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.MatrixAnimationUsingPath.DoesRotateWithTangent%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.MatrixAnimationUsingPath.IsAngleCumulative%2A> properties to `true`.  \n  \n For the complete sample, see [Path Animation Sample](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=160028).
