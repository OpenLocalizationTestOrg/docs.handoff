In some cases, the variable's *access level* can influence its scope.  \n  \n For more information, see [Scope in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/scope.md).  \n  \n## Scope at Block or Procedure Level  \n  \n#### To make a variable visible only within a block  \n  \n-   Place the [Dim Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/dim-statement.md) for the variable between the initiating and terminating declaration statements of that block, for example between the `For` and `Next` statements of a `For` loop.  \n  \n     You can refer to the variable only from within the block.  \n  \n#### To make a variable visible only within a procedure  \n  \n-   Place the `Dim` statement for the variable inside the procedure but outside any block (such as a `With`...`End With` block).  \n  \n     You can refer to the variable only from within the procedure, including inside any block contained in the procedure.  \n  \n## Scope at Module or Namespace Level  \n For convenience, the single term *module level* applies equally to modules, classes, and structures. The access level of a module level variable determines its scope. The namespace that contains the module, class, or structure also influences the scope.  \n  \n#### To make a variable visible throughout a module, class, or structure  \n  \n1.  Place the `Dim` statement for the variable inside the module, class, or structure, but outside any procedure.  \n  \n2.  Include the [Private](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/private.md) keyword in the `Dim` statement.  \n  \n3.  You can refer to the variable from anywhere within the module, class, or structure, but not from outside it.  \n  \n#### To make a variable visible throughout a namespace  \n  \n1.  Place the `Dim` statement for the variable inside the module, class, or structure, but outside any procedure.  \n  \n2.  Include the [Friend](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/friend.md) or [Public](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/public.md) keyword in the `Dim` statement.  \n  \n3.  You can refer to the variable from anywhere within the namespace containing the module, class, or structure.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example declares a variable at module level and limits its visibility to code within the module.  \n  \n```  \nModule demonstrateScope  \n    Private strMsg As String  \n    Sub initializePrivateVariable()  \n        strMsg = \"This variable cannot be used outside this module.\"  \n    End Sub  \n    Sub usePrivateVariable()  \n        MsgBox(strMsg)  \n    End Sub  \nEnd Module  \n```  \n  \n In the preceding example, all the procedures defined in module `demonstrateScope` can refer to the `String` variable `strMsg`. When the `usePrivateVariable` procedure is called, it displays the contents of the string variable `strMsg` in a dialog box.  \n  \n With the following alteration to the preceding example, the string variable `strMsg` can be referred to by code anywhere in the namespace of its declaration.  \n  \n```  \nPublic strMsg As String  \n```  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The narrower the scope of a variable, the fewer opportunities you have for accidentally referring to it in place of another variable with the same name. You can also minimize problems of reference matching.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n The narrower the scope of a variable, the smaller the chances that malicious code can make improper use of it.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Scope in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/scope.md)   \n [Lifetime in Visual
