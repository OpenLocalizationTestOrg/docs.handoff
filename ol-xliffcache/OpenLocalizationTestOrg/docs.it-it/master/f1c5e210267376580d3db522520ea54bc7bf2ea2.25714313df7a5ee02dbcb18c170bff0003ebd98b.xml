You can extract the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> from the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs>. With this <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>, you can affect the appearance of the entire <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control, but you will usually want to affect only the appearance of the cell that is currently being painted. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs.ClipBounds%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPaintingEventArgs> enables you to restrict your painting operations to the cell that is currently being painted.  \n  \n In the following code example, you will paint all the cells in a `ContactName` column using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's color scheme. Each cell's text content is painted in <xref:System.Drawing.Color.Crimson%2A>, and an inset rectangle is drawn in the same color as the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.GridColor%2A> property.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPainting#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPainting/CS/form1.cs#10)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPainting#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellPainting/VB/form1.vb#10)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control named `dataGridView1` with a `ContactName` column such as the one in the Customers table in the Northwind sample database.  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Windows.Forms, and System.Drawing assemblies.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>   \n
