This results in the operator procedure calling itself because of the data types being used.  \n  \n The operator procedure you are defining calls itself if it uses the same operator with any of the following:  \n  \n-   The same operands for which you are defining the operator;  \n  \n-   Operands of the same data types for which you are defining the operator; or  \n  \n-   Operands of data types that widen to the data types for which you are defining the operator.  \n  \n A *recursive call* is when a procedure calls itself. Recursive calls can result in an *infinite loop*, in which control passes through the same set of statements repeatedly until your application is terminated externally. If your code does not include one or more tests that can be used to terminate recursion, you risk an infinite loop.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
