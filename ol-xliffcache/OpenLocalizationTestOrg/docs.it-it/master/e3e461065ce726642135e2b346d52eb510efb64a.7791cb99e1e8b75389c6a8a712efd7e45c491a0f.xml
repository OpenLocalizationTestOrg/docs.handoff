Create a WPF Application project named                                  `LocalizingWpfInWf`. For more information, see                                  [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  \n  \n2.  Add a                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]<xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl> element called                                  `SimpleControl` to the project.  \n  \n3.  Use the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control to place a                                  `SimpleControl` element on the form. For more information, see                                  [Walkthrough: Hosting a 3-D WPF Composite Control in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-hosting-a-3-d-wpf-composite-control-in-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n## Adding Localizable Content  \n Next, you will add a                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] label control and set the                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] element's content to a localizable string.  \n  \n#### To add localizable content  \n  \n1.  In Solution Explorer, double-click                                  **SimpleControl.xaml** to open it in the                                  [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  Set the content of the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> control using the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[LocalizingWpfInWf#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizingWpfInWf/CSharp/SimpleControl0.xaml#10)]  \n  \n3.  In Solution Explorer, double-click                                  **Form1** to open it in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n4.  Open the Toolbox and double-click                                  **Label** to add a label control to the form. Set the value of its                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property to                                  `\"Hello\"`.  \n  \n5.  Press F5 to build and run the application.  \n  \n     Both the                                  `SimpleControl` element and the label control display the text                                  **\"Hello\"**.  \n  \n## Enabling Localization  \n The Windows Forms Designer provides settings for enabling localization in a satellite assembly.  \n  \n#### To enable localization  \n  \n1.  In Solution Explorer, double-click                                  **Form1.cs** to open it in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the Properties window, set the value of the form's                                  **Localizable** property to                                  `true`.  \n  \n3.  In the Properties window, set the value of the                                  **Language** property to                                  **Spanish (Spain)**.  \n  \n4.  In the Windows Forms Designer, select the label control.  \n  \n5.  In the Properties window, set the value of the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property to                                  `\"Hola\"`.  \n  \n     A new resource file named Form1.es-ES.resx is added to the project.  \n  \n6.  In Solution Explorer, right-click                                  **Form1.cs** and click                                  **View Code** to open it in the Code Editor.  \n  \n7.  Copy the following code into the                                  `Form1` constructor, preceding the call to                                  `InitializeComponent`.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[LocalizingWpfInWf#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizingWpfInWf/CSharp/Form1.cs#2)]  \n  \n8.  In Solution Explorer, right-click                                  **LocalizingWpfInWf** and click                                  **Unload Project**.  \n  \n     The project name is labeled                                  **(unavailable)**.  \n  \n9. Right-click                                  **LocalizingWpfInWf**, and click                                  **Edit LocalizingWpfInWf.csproj**.  \n  \n     The project file opens in the Code Editor.  \n  \n10. Copy the following line into the first                                  `PropertyGroup` in the project file.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <UICulture>en-US</UICulture>   \n    ```  \n  \n11. Save the project file and close it.  \n  \n12. In Solution Explorer, right-click                                  **LocalizingWpfInWf** and click                                  **Reload Project**.  \n  \n## Assigning Resource Identifiers  \n You can map your localizable content to resource assemblies by using resource identifiers. The MsBuild.exe application automatically assigns resource identifiers when you specify the                  `updateuid` option.  \n  \n#### To assign resource identifiers  \n  \n1.  From the Start Menu, open the                                  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Command Prompt.  \n  \n2.  Use the following command to assign resource identifiers to your localizable content.  \n  \n    ```  \n    msbuild /t:updateuid LocalizingWpfInWf.csproj  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  In Solution Explorer, double-click                                  **SimpleControl.xaml** to open it in the Code Editor. You will see that the                                  `msbuild` command has added the                                  `Uid` attribute to all the elements. This facilitates localization through the assignment of resource identifiers.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[LocalizingWpfInWf#20](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/LocalizingWpfInWf/CSharp/SimpleControl.xaml#20)]  \n  \n4.  Press F6 to build the solution.  \n  \n## Using LocBaml to Produce a Satellite Assembly  \n Your localized content is stored in a resource-only                  *satellite assembly*. Use the command-line tool LocBaml.exe to produce a localized assembly for your                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] content.  \n  \n#### To produce a satellite assembly  \n  \n1.  Copy LocBaml.exe to your project's obj\\Debug folder. For more information, see                                  [Localize an Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-localize-an-application.md).  \n  \n2.  In the Command Prompt window, use the following command to extract resource strings into a temporary file.  \n  \n    ```  \n    LocBaml /parse LocalizingWpfInWf.g.en-US.resources /out:temp.csv  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Open the temp.csv file with                                  [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] or another text editor. Replace the string                                  `\"Hello\"` with its Spanish translation,                                  `\"Hola\"`.  \n  \n4.  Save the temp.csv file.  \n  \n5.  Use the following command to generate the localized resource file.  \n  \n    ```  \n    LocBaml /generate /trans:temp.csv LocalizingWpfInWf.g.en-US.resources /out:. /cul:es-ES  \n    ```  \n  \n     The LocalizingWpfInWf.g.es-ES.resources file is created in the obj\\Debug folder.  \n  \n6.  Use the following command to build the localized satellite assembly.  \n  \n    ```  \n    Al.exe /out:LocalizingWpfInWf.resources.dll /culture:es-ES /embed:LocalizingWpfInWf.Form1.es-ES.resources /embed:LocalizingWpfInWf.g.es-ES.resources  \n    ```  \n  \n     The LocalizingWpfInWf.resources.dll file is created in the obj\\Debug folder.  \n  \n7.  Copy the LocalizingWpfInWf.resources.dll file to the project's bin\\Debug\\es-ES folder. Replace the existing file.  \n  \n8.  Run LocalizingWpfInWf.exe, which is located in your project's bin\\Debug folder. Do not rebuild the application or the satellite assembly will be overwritten.  \n  \n     The application shows the localized strings instead of the English strings.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
