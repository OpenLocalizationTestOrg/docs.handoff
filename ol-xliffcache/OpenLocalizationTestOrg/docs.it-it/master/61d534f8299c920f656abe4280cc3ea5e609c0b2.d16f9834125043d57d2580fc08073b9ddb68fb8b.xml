The `Bitmap` and the `Metafile` classes both inherit from the `Image` class.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Draw an Existing Bitmap to the Screen](how-to-draw-an-existing-bitmap-to-the-screen.md)  \n Describes how to load and draw bitmaps.  \n  \n [How to: Load and Display Metafiles](how-to-load-and-display-metafiles.md)  \n Shows how to load and draw metafiles.  \n  \n [Cropping and Scaling Images in GDI+](cropping-and-scaling-images-in-gdi.md)  \n Explains how to crop and scale vector and raster images.  \n  \n [How to: Rotate, Reflect, and Skew Images](how-to-rotate-reflect-and-skew-images.md)  \n Describes how to draw rotated, reflected and skewed images.  \n  \n [How to: Use Interpolation Mode to Control Image Quality During Scaling](how-to-use-interpolation-mode-to-control-image-quality-during-scaling.md)  \n Shows how to use the <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.InterpolationMode> enumeration to change image quality.  \n  \n [How to: Create Thumbnail Images](how-to-create-thumbnail-images.md)  \n Describes how to create thumbnail images.  \n  \n [How to: Improve Performance by Avoiding Automatic Scaling](how-to-improve-performance-by-avoiding-automatic-scaling.md)  \n Explains how to draw an image without automatic scaling.  \n  \n [How to: Read Image Metadata](how-to-read-image-metadata.md)  \n Describes how to read metadata from an image.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Bitmap at Run Time](how-to-create-a-bitmap-at-run-time.md)  \n Shows how to draw a bitmap at runtime.  \n  \n [How to:
