Chaining queries together is a key part of writing functional transformations. It is important to understand exactly how chained queries work.  \n  \n The queries that process Office Open XML documents use this technique extensively.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n  \n|Topic|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|[Deferred Execution and Lazy Evaluation in LINQ to XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-and-lazy-evaluation-in-linq-to-xml.md)|Describes the concepts of deferred execution and lazy evaluation.|  \n|[Deferred Execution Example (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-example.md)|Provides an example of deferred execution.|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Pure Functional Transformations of XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/pure-functional-transformations-of-xml.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,72],"content":"Tutorial: Deferred Execution (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Tutorial: Deferred Execution (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[379,422],"content":"Tutorial: Deferred Execution (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Tutorial: Deferred Execution (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Tutorial: Deferred Execution (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"This tutorial illustrates the processing model when you chain queries together.","pos":[423,502]},{"content":"Chaining queries together is a key part of writing functional transformations.","pos":[503,581]},{"content":"It is important to understand exactly how chained queries work.","pos":[582,645]},{"content":"The queries that process Office Open XML documents use this technique extensively.","pos":[652,734]},{"pos":[743,758],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Topic","pos":[765,770]},{"content":"Description","pos":[771,782]},{"pos":[821,1006],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Deferred Execution and Lazy Evaluation in LINQ to XML (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-and-lazy-evaluation-in-linq-to-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Deferred Execution and Lazy Evaluation in LINQ to XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-and-lazy-evaluation-in-linq-to-xml.md)"},{"content":"Describes the concepts of deferred execution and lazy evaluation.","pos":[1007,1072]},{"pos":[1077,1208],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Deferred Execution Example (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-example.md)</ept>","source":"[Deferred Execution Example (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/deferred-execution-example.md)"},{"content":"Provides an example of deferred execution.","pos":[1209,1251]},{"pos":[1261,1269],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1273,1428],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Pure Functional Transformations of XML (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/pure-functional-transformations-of-xml.md)</ept>","source":"[Pure Functional Transformations of XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/pure-functional-transformations-of-xml.md)"}]}
