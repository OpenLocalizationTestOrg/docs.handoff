This method requests that the workflow persist and unload, and will throw a <xref:System.TimeoutException> if the workflow does not unload in 30 seconds.  \n  \n```csharp  \ntry  \n{  \n    // attempt to unload will fail if the workflow is idle within a NoPersistZone  \n    application.Unload(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));  \n}  \ncatch (TimeoutException e)  \n{  \n    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Resuming a Workflow  \n To resume a previously paused and unloaded workflow, use <xref:System.Activities.WorkflowApplication.Load%2A>. This method loads a workflow from a persistence store into memory.  \n  \n```csharp  \nWorkflowApplication application = new WorkflowApplication(activity);  \napplication.InstanceStore = instanceStore;  \napplication.Load(id);  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code sample demonstrates how to pause and resume a workflow by using persistence.  \n  \n```csharp  \nstatic string bkName = \"bkName\";  \nstatic void Main(string[] args)   \n{  \n    StartAndUnloadInstance();  \n}  \n  \nstatic void StartAndUnloadInstance()   \n{  \n    AutoResetEvent waitHandler = new AutoResetEvent(false);  \n    WorkflowApplication wfApp = new WorkflowApplication(GetDelayedWF());  \n    SqlWorkflowInstanceStore instanceStore = SetupSqlpersistenceStore();  \n    wfApp.InstanceStore = instanceStore;  \n    wfApp.Extensions.Add(SetupMyFileTrackingParticipant);  \n    wfApp.PersistableIdle = (e) => {          ///persists application state and remove it from memory   \n    return PersistableIdleAction.Unload;  \n    };  \n    wfApp.Unloaded = (e) => {  \n        waitHandler.Set();  \n    };  \n    Guid id = wfApp.Id;  \n    wfApp.Run();  \n    waitHandler.WaitOne();  \n    LoadAndCompleteInstance(id);  \n}  \n  \nstatic void LoadAndCompleteInstance(Guid id)   \n{            \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Press <enter> to load the persisted workflow\");  \n    Console.ReadLine();  \n    AutoResetEvent waitHandler = new AutoResetEvent(false);  \n    WorkflowApplication wfApp = new WorkflowApplication(new Workflow1());  \n    wfApp.InstanceStore =  \n        new SqlWorkflowInstanceStore(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"SqlWF4PersistenceConnectionString\"].ToString());  \n    wfApp.Completed = (workflowApplicationCompletedEventArgs) => {  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"\\nWorkflowApplication has Completed in the {0} state.\",  \n            workflowApplicationCompletedEventArgs.CompletionState);  \n    };  \n    wfApp.Unloaded = (workflowApplicationEventArgs) => {  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"WorkflowApplication has Unloaded\\n\");  \n        waitHandler.Set();  \n    };  \n    wfApp.Load(id);  \n    wfApp.Run();  \n    waitHandler.WaitOne();  \n}  \n  \npublic static Activity GetDelayedWF()   \n{  \n    return new Sequence {  \n        Activities ={  \n            new WriteLine{Text=\"Workflow Started\"},  \n            new Delay{Duration=TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)},  \n            new WriteLine{Text=\"Workflow Ended\"}  \n        }  \n    };
