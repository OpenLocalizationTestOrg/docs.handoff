These controls are normally declared private, and thus cannot be accessed by the developer. If you want to make properties of these controls available to future users, you must expose them to the user. A property of a constituent control is exposed by creating a property in the user control, and using the `get` and `set` accessors of that property to effect the change in the private property of the constituent control.  \n  \n Consider a hypothetical user control with a constituent button named `MyButton`. In this example, when the user requests the `ConstituentButtonBackColor` property, the value stored in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property of `MyButton` is delivered. When the user assigns a value to this property, that value is automatically passed to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property of `MyButton` and the `set` code will execute, changing the color of `MyButton`.  \n  \n The following example shows how to expose the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> property of the constituent button:  \n  \n```vb  \nPublic Property ButtonColor() as System.Drawing.Color  \n   Get  \n      Return MyButton.BackColor  \n   End Get  \n   Set(Value as System.Drawing.Color)  \n      MyButton.BackColor = Value  \n   End Set  \nEnd Property  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \npublic Color ButtonColor  \n{  \n   get  \n   {  \n      return(myButton.BackColor);  \n   }  \n   set  \n   {  \n      myButton.BackColor = value;  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n### To expose a property of a constituent control  \n  \n1.  Create a public property for your user control.  \n  \n2.  In the `get` section of the property, write code that retrieves the value of the property you want to expose.  \n  \n3.  In the `set` section of the property, write code that passes the value of the property to the exposed property of the constituent control.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl>   \n [Properties in Windows Forms Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/properties-in-windows-forms-controls.md)   \n [Varieties of Custom Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/varieties-of-custom-controls.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,628],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Expose Properties of Constituent Controls | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,66],"content":"How to: Expose Properties of Constituent Controls | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Expose Properties of Constituent Controls | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]}],"pos":[6,75],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Expose Properties of Constituent Controls | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
