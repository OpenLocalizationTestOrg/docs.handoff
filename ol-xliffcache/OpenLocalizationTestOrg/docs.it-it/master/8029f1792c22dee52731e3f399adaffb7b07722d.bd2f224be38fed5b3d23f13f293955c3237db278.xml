Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a panel gives the user a logical visual cue. At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, all its contained controls move, too. The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> property. This property returns a collection of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type.  \n  \n## Panel Versus GroupBox  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption.  \n  \n## Key Properties  \n To display scroll bars, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> property to `true`. You can also customize the appearance of the panel by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> properties. For more information on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> properties, see [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md). The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> property determines if the panel is outlined with no visible border (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>), a plain line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>), or a shadowed line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>   \n [GroupBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/group-controls-with-wf-panel-control-using-the-designer.md)   \n [How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel-using-the-designer.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,67],"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,55]}]},{"pos":[549,587],"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[588,709],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[710,768]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[769,879]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a panel gives the user a logical visual cue.","pos":[880,948]},{"content":"At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control, all its contained controls move, too.","pos":[949,1101],"source":" At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, all its contained controls move, too."},{"content":"The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[1102,1219],"source":" The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> property."},{"content":"This property returns a collection of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control&gt;</ph> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type.","pos":[1220,1390],"source":" This property returns a collection of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type."},{"pos":[1399,1420],"content":"Panel Versus GroupBox","linkify":"Panel Versus GroupBox","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Versus GroupBox","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control;
