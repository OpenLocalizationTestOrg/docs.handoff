Many governments have accessibility regulations for software purchase. The Certified for Windows logo includes accessibility requirements. An estimated 30 million residents of the U.S. alone, many of them potential customers, are affected by the accessibility of software.  \n  \n This walkthrough will address the five accessibility requirements for the Certified for Windows logo. According to these requirements, an accessible application will:  \n  \n-   Support Control Panel size, color, font, and input settings. The menu bar, title bar, borders, and status bar will all resize themselves when the user changes the control panel settings. No additional changes to the controls or code are required in this application.  \n  \n-   Support High Contrast mode.  \n  \n-   Provide documented keyboard access to all features.  \n  \n-   Expose location of the keyboard focus visually and programmatically.  \n  \n-   Avoid conveying important information by sound alone.  \n  \n For more information, see [Resources for Designing Accessible Applications](/visualstudio/ide/reference/resources-for-designing-accessible-applications).  \n  \n For information on supporting varying keyboard layouts, see [Best Practices for Developing World-Ready Applications](../../../../docs/standard/globalization-localization/best-practices-for-developing-world-ready-apps.md).  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n This walkthrough creates the user interface for an application that takes pizza orders. It consists of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> for the customer's name, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> group to select the pizza size, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckedListBox> for selecting the toppings, two Button controls labeled Order and Cancel, and a Menu with an Exit command.  \n  \n The user enters the customer's name, the size of the pizza, and the toppings desired. When the user clicks the Order button, a summary of the order and its cost are displayed in a message box and the controls are cleared and ready for the next order. When the user clicks the Cancel button, the controls are cleared and ready for the next order. When the user clicks the Exit menu item, the program closes.  \n  \n The emphasis of this walkthrough is not the code for a retail order system, but the accessibility of the user interface. The walkthrough demonstrates the accessibility features of several frequently used controls, including buttons, radio buttons, text boxes, and labels.  \n  \n#### To begin making the application  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Application in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]. Name the project **PizzaOrder**. (For details see [Creating New Solutions and Projects](/visualstudio/ide/creating-solutions-and-projects).)  \n  \n## Adding the Controls to the Form  \n When adding the controls to a form, keep in mind the following guidelines to make an accessible application:  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleDescription%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleName%2A> properties. In this example, the Default setting for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AccessibleRole%2A> is sufficient. For more information on the accessibility properties, see [Providing Accessibility Information for Controls on a Windows Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/providing-accessibility-information-for-controls-on-a-windows-form.md).  \n  \n-   Set the font size to 10 points or larger.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  If you set the font size of the form to 10 when you start, then all controls subsequently added to the form will have a font size of 10.  \n  \n-   Make sure any Label control that describes a TextBox control immediately precedes the TextBox control in the tab order.  \n  \n-   Add an access key, using the \"&\" character, to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of any control the user may want to navigate to.  \n  \n-   Add an access key, using the \"&\" character, to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Text%2A> property of the label that precedes a control that the user may want to navigate to. Set the labels' <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Label.UseMnemonic%2A> property to `true`, so that the focus is set to the next control in the tab order when the user presses the access key.  \n  \n-   Add access keys to all menu items.  \n  \n#### To make your Windows Application accessible  \n  \n-   Add the controls to the form and set the properties as described below. See the picture at the end of the table for a model of how to arrange the controls on the form.  \n  \n    |Object|Property|Value|  \n    |------------|--------------|-----------|  \n    |Form1|AccessibleDescription|Order form|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Order form|  \n    ||Font Size|10|  \n    ||Text|Pizza Order Form|  \n    |PictureBox|Name|logo|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|A slice of pizza|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Company logo|  \n    ||Image|Any icon or bitmap|  \n    |Label|Name|companyLabel|  \n    ||Text|Good Pizza|  \n    ||TabIndex|1|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Company name|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Company name|  \n    ||Backcolor|Blue|  \n    ||Forecolor|Yellow|  \n    ||Font size|18|  \n    |Label|Name|customerLabel|  \n    ||Text|&Name|  \n    ||TabIndex|2|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Customer name label|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Customer name label|  \n    ||UseMnemonic|True|  \n    |TextBox|Name|customerName|  \n    ||Text|(none)|  \n    ||TabIndex|3|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Customer name|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Customer name|  \n    |GroupBox|Name|sizeOptions|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Pizza size options|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Pizza size options|  \n    ||Text|Pizza size|  \n    ||TabIndex|4|  \n    |RadioButton|Name|smallPizza|  \n    ||Text|&Small $6.00|  \n    ||Checked|True|  \n    ||TabIndex|0|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Small pizza|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Small pizza|  \n    |RadioButton|Name|largePizza|  \n    ||Text|&Large $10.00|  \n    ||TabIndex|1|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Large pizza|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Large pizza|  \n    |Label|Name|toppingsLabel|  \n    ||Text|&Toppings ($0.75 each)|  \n    ||TabIndex|5|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Toppings label|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Toppings label|  \n    ||UseMnemonic|True|  \n    |CheckedListBox|Name|toppings|  \n    ||TabIndex|6|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Available toppings|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Available toppings|  \n    ||Items|Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms|  \n    |Button|Name|order|  \n    ||Text|&Order|  \n    ||TabIndex|7|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Total the order|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Total order|  \n    |Button|Name|cancel|  \n    ||Text|&Cancel|  \n    ||TabIndex|8|  \n    ||AccessibleDescription|Cancel the order|  \n    ||AccessibleName|Cancel order|  \n    |MainMenu|Name|theMainMenu|  \n    |MenuItem|Name|fileCommands|  \n    ||Text|&File|  \n    |MenuItem|Name|exitApp|  \n    ||Text|E&xit|  \n  \n     ![Pizza Order Form](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/vbpizzaorderform.gif \"vbPizzaOrderForm\")  \nYour form will look something like the following:  \n  \n## Supporting High Contrast Mode  \n High Contrast mode is a Windows system setting that improves readability by using contrasting colors and font sizes that are beneficial for visually impaired users. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.HighContrast%2A> property is provided to determine whether the High Contrast mode is set.  \n  \n If SystemInformation.HighContrast is `true`, the application should:  \n  \n-   Display all user interface elements using the system color scheme  \n  \n-   Convey by visual cues or sound any information that is conveyed through color. For example, if particular list items are highlighted by using a red font, you could also add bold to the font, so that the user has a non-color cue that the items are highlighted.  \n  \n-   Omit any images or patterns behind text  \n  \n The application should check the setting of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.HighContrast%2A> when the application starts and respond to the system event <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged>. The <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged> event is raised whenever the value of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.HighContrast%2A> changes.  \n  \n In our application, the only element that is not using the system settings for color is `lblCompanyName`. The <xref:System.Drawing.SystemColors> class is used to change the color settings of the label to the user-selected system colors.  \n  \n#### To enable High Contrast mode in an effective way  \n  \n1.  Create a method to set the colors of the label to the system colors.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ' Visual Basic  \n    Private Sub SetColorScheme()  \n       If SystemInformation.HighContrast Then  \n          companyLabel.BackColor = SystemColors.Window  \n          companyLabel.ForeColor = SystemColors.WindowText  \n       Else  \n          companyLabel.BackColor = Color.Blue  \n          companyLabel.ForeColor = Color.Yellow  \n       End If  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    // C#  \n    private void SetColorScheme()  \n    {  \n       if (SystemInformation.HighContrast)  \n       {  \n          companyLabel.BackColor = SystemColors.Window;  \n          companyLabel.ForeColor = SystemColors.WindowText;  \n       }  \n       else  \n       {  \n          companyLabel.BackColor = Color.Blue;  \n          companyLabel.ForeColor = Color.Yellow;  \n       }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n2.  Call the `SetColorScheme` procedure in the form constructor (`Public Sub New()` in Visual Basic and `public class Form1` in Visual C#). To access the constructor in Visual Basic, you will need to expand the region labeled **Windows Form Designer generated code**.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ' Visual Basic   \n    Public Sub New()  \n       MyBase.New()  \n       InitializeComponent()  \n       SetColorScheme()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    // C#  \n    public Form1()  \n    {  \n       InitializeComponent();  \n       SetColorScheme();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Create an event procedure, with the appropriate signature, to respond to the <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged> event.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ' Visual Basic  \n    Protected Sub UserPreferenceChanged(ByVal sender As Object, _  \n    ByVal e As Microsoft.Win32.UserPreferenceChangedEventArgs)  \n       SetColorScheme()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    // C#  \n    public void UserPreferenceChanged(object sender,   \n    Microsoft.Win32.UserPreferenceChangedEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       SetColorScheme();  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  Add code to the form constructor, after the call to `InitializeComponents`, to hook up the event procedure to the system event. This method calls the `SetColorScheme` procedure.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ' Visual Basic  \n    Public Sub New()  \n       MyBase.New()  \n       InitializeComponent()  \n       SetColorScheme()  \n       AddHandler Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged, _  \n          AddressOf Me.UserPreferenceChanged  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    // C#  \n    public Form1()  \n    {  \n       InitializeComponent();  \n       SetColorScheme();  \n       Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged   \n          += new Microsoft.Win32.UserPreferenceChangedEventHandler(  \n          this.UserPreferenceChanged);  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Add code to the form <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dispose%2A> method, before the call to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dispose%2A> method of the base class, to release the event when the application closes. To access the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dispose%2A> method in Visual Basic, you will need to expand the region labeled Windows Form Designer generated code.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The system event code runs a thread separate from the main application. If you do not release the event, the code that you hook up to the event will run even after the program is closed.  \n  \n    ```  \n    ' Visual Basic  \n    Protected Overloads Overrides Sub Dispose(ByVal disposing As Boolean)  \n       If disposing Then  \n          If Not (components Is Nothing) Then  \n             components.Dispose()  \n          End If  \n       End If  \n       RemoveHandler Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged, _  \n          AddressOf Me.UserPreferenceChanged  \n       MyBase.Dispose(disposing)  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    // C#  \n    protected override void Dispose( bool disposing )  \n    {  \n       if( disposing )  \n       {  \n          if (components != null)   \n          {  \n             components.Dispose();  \n          }  \n       }  \n       Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged   \n          -= new Microsoft.Win32.UserPreferenceChangedEventHandler(  \n          this.UserPreferenceChanged);  \n       base.Dispose( disposing );  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Press F5 to run the application.  \n  \n## Conveying Important Information by Means Other Than Sound  \n In this application, no information is conveyed by sound alone. If you use sound in your application, then you should supply the information by some other means as well.  \n  \n#### To supply information by some other means than sound  \n  \n1.  Make the title bar flash by using the Windows API function FlashWindow. For an example of how to call Windows API functions, see [Walkthrough: Calling Windows APIs](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/com-interop/walkthrough-calling-windows-apis.md).  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  The user may have the Windows SoundSentry service enabled, which will also cause the window to flash when the system sounds are played through the computer's built-in speaker.  \n  \n2.  Display the important information in a non-modal window so that the user may respond to it.  \n  \n3.  Display a message box that acquires the keyboard focus. Avoid this method when the user may be typing.  \n  \n4.  Display a status indicator in the status notification area of the taskbar. For details, see [Adding Application Icons to the TaskBar with the Windows Forms NotifyIcon Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/app-icons-to-the-taskbar-with-wf-notifyicon.md).  \n  \n## Testing the Application  \n Before deploying the application, you should test the accessibility features that you have implemented.  \n  \n#### To test accessibility features  \n  \n1.  To test keyboard access, unplug the mouse and navigate the user interface for each feature using only the keyboard. Ensure that all tasks may be performed using the keyboard only.  \n  \n2.  To test support of High Contrast, choose the Accessibility Options icon in Control Panel. Click the Display tab and select the Use High Contrast check box. Navigate through all user interface elements to ensure that the color and font changes are reflected. Also, ensure that images or patterns drawn behind text are omitted.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Windows NT 4 does not have an Accessibility Options icon in Control Panel. Thus, this procedure for changing the SystemInformation.HighContrast setting does not work in Windows NT 4.  \n  \n3.  Other tools are readily available for testing the accessibility of an application.  \n  \n4.  To test exposing the keyboard focus, run Magnifier. (To open it, click the **Start** menu, point to **Programs**, point to **Accessories**, point to **Accessibility**, and then click **Magnifier**). Navigate the user interface using both keyboard tabbing and the mouse. Ensure that all navigation is tracked properly in **Magnifier**.  \n  \n5.  To test exposing screen elements, run Inspect, and use both the mouse and the TAB key to reach each element. Ensure that the information presented in the Name, State, Role, Location, and Value fields of the Inspect window is meaningful to the user for each object in the UI.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,90],"content":"Walkthrough: Creating an Accessible Windows-based Application | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Creating
