Once the node is selected, you can insert it into the tree using one of the insert methods that work for that particular node type. The only restriction to inserting a node into the tree is that the document must still be well-formed after the node is inserted. When an existing node is inserted into the DOM tree, it is removed from its original position and added to its target position.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,48],"content":"Copy Existing Nodes | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Copy Existing Nodes | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[393,412],"content":"Copy Existing Nodes","linkify":"Copy Existing Nodes","nodes":[{"content":"Copy Existing Nodes","pos":[0,19]}]},{"content":"There are many methods and properties in the XML Document Object Model (DOM)you can use to select a node, such as <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>SelectSingleNode<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>ChildNodes[int i]<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Attributes[int i]<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","pos":[413,594],"source":"There are many methods and properties in the XML Document Object Model (DOM)you can use to select a node, such as **SelectSingleNode**, **ChildNodes[int i]**, **Attributes[int i]**."},{"content":"Once the node is selected, you can insert it into the tree using one of the insert methods that work for that particular node type.","pos":[595,726]},{"content":"The only restriction to inserting a node into the tree is that the document must still be well-formed after the node is inserted.","pos":[727,856]},{"content":"When an existing node is inserted into the DOM tree, it is removed from its original position and added to its target position.","pos":[857,984]},{"pos":[993,1001],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1005,1107],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML Document Object Model (DOM)<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)</ept>","source":"[XML Document Object Model (DOM)](../../../../docs/standard/data/xml/xml-document-object-model-dom.md)"}]}
