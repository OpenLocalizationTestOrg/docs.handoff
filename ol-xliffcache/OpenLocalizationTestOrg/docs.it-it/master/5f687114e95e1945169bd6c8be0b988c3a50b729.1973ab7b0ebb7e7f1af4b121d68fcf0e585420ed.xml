As a result, the compiler cannot determine which version to override.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30935  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Change the type argument or arguments you supply to the base class so that it does not result in one or more identical signatures of member procedures or properties.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   If you need to inherit the base class with the set of type arguments you are using, then do not override the procedure or property cited in this error message.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Overridable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overridable.md)\n- [Overrides](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md)\n- [Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,355],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Member '<classname>.<procedurename>' that matches this signature cannot be overridden because the class '<classname>' contains multiple members with this same name and signature: <signaturelist>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
