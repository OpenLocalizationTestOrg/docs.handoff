This pattern allows a service to communicate with the client through a callback. This topic shows the steps to create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client in a client class that implements the callback interface.  \n  \n A dual binding exposes the IP address of the client to the service. The client should use security to ensure that it connects only to services it trusts.  \n  \n For a tutorial on creating a basic [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service and client, see [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md).  \n  \n### To access a duplex service  \n  \n1.  Create a service that contains two interfaces. The first interface is for the service, the second is for the callback. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] creating a duplex service, see [How to: Create a Duplex Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-duplex-contract.md).  \n  \n2.  Run the service.  \n  \n3.  Use the [ServiceModel Metadata Utility Tool (Svcutil.exe)](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/servicemodel-metadata-utility-tool-svcutil-exe.md) to generate contracts (interfaces) for the client. For information about how to do this, see  [How to: Create a Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-create-a-wcf-client.md).  \n  \n4.  Implement the callback interface in the client class, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public class CallbackHandler : ICalculatorDuplexCallback  \n    {  \n        public void Result(double result)  \n        {  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Result ({0})\", result);  \n        }  \n        public void Equation(string equation)  \n        {  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Equation({0})\", equation);  \n        }  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Class CallbackHandler   \n    Implements ICalculatorDuplexCallback  \n       Public Sub Result (ByVal result As Double)  \n          Console.WriteLine(\"Result ({0})\", result)  \n       End Sub  \n        Public Sub Equation(ByVal equation As String)  \n            Console.Writeline(\"Equation({0})\", equation)  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> class. The constructor requires an instance of the client class.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    InstanceContext site = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim site As InstanceContext = New InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler())  \n    ```  \n  \n6.  Create an instance of the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client using the constructor that requires an <xref:System.ServiceModel.InstanceContext> object. The second parameter of the constructor is the name of an endpoint found in the configuration file.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    CalculatorDuplexClient wcfClient =   \n    new CalculatorDuplexClient(site, \"default\")  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim wcfClient As New CalculatorDuplexClient(site, \"default\")  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  Call the methods of the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client as required.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example demonstrates how to create a client class that accesses a duplex contract.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[S_DuplexClients#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/s_duplexclients/cs/client.cs#1)]\n
