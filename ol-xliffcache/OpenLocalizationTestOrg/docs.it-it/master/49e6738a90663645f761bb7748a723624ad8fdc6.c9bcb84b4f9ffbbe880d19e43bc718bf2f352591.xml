It's useful for fast iterative development from the command line. The command depends on the [`dotnet build`](dotnet-build.md) command to build the code. Any requirements for the build, such as that the project must be restored first, apply to `dotnet run` as well. \n\nOutput files are written into the default location, which is `bin/<configuration>/<target>`. For example if you have a `netcoreapp1.0` application and you run `dotnet run`, the output is placed in `bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0`. Files are overwritten as needed. Temporary files are placed in the `obj` directory. \n\nIf the project specifies multiple frameworks, executing `dotnet run` results in an error unless the `-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>` option is used to specify the framework.\n\nThe `dotnet run` command is used in the context of projects, not built assemblies. If you're trying to run a framework-dependent application DLL instead, you must use [dotnet](dotnet.md) without a command. For example, to run `myapp.dll`, use:\n \n```\ndotnet myapp.dll\n```\n\nFor more information on the `dotnet` driver, see the [.NET Core Command Line Tools (CLI)](index.md) topic.\n\nIn order to run the application, the `dotnet run` command resolves the dependencies of the application that are outside of the shared runtime from the NuGet cache. Because it uses cached dependencies, it's not recommended to use `dotnet run` to run applications in production. Instead, [create a deployment](../deploying/index.md) using the [`dotnet publish`](dotnet-publish.md) command and deploy the published output. \n\n## Options\n\n`--`\n\nDelimits arguments to `dotnet run` from arguments for the application being run. All arguments after this one are passed to the application run. \n\n`-h|--help`\n\nPrints out a short help for the command.\n\n`-c|--configuration <CONFIGURATION>`\n\nConfiguration to use for building the project. The default value is `Debug`.\n\n`-f|--framework <FRAMEWORK>`\n\nBuilds and runs the app using the specified [framework](../../standard/frameworks.md). The framework must be specified in the project file.\n\n`-p|--project <PATH/PROJECT.csproj>`\n\nSpecifies the path and name of the project file. (See the NOTE.) It defaults to the current directory if not specified.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Use the path and name of the project file with the `-p|--project` option. A regression in the CLI prevents providing a folder path at this time. For more information and to track this issue, see [dotnet run -p, can not start a project (dotnet/cli #5992)](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/5992).\n\n## Examples\n\nRun the project in the current directory:\n\n`dotnet run` \n\nRun the specified project:\n\n`dotnet run --project /projects/proj1/proj1.csproj`\n\nRun the project in the current directory (the `--help` argument in this example is passed to the application, since the `--` argument is used):\n\n`dotnet run --configuration Release -- --help`\n","nodes":[{"pos":[11,62],"content":"dotnet-run command - .NET Core CLI |
