You can create instances of the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics> class that is associated with drawing surfaces on your screen by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphicsContext.Allocate%2A> method. This method creates a <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics> instance that is associated with a particular rendering surface, such as a form or control. After you have created a <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics> instance, you can draw graphics to the buffer it represents through the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics.Graphics%2A> property. After you have performed all graphics operations, you can copy the contents of the buffer to the screen by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics.Render%2A> method.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  If you perform your own rendering, memory consumption will increase, though the increase may only be slight.  \n  \n### To manually display buffered graphics  \n  \n1.  Obtain a reference to an instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphicsContext> class. For more information, see [How to: Manually Manage Buffered Graphics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-manually-manage-buffered-graphics.md).  \n  \n2.  Create an instance of the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics> class by calling the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphicsContext.Allocate%2A> method, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#21](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#21](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n  \n3.  Draw graphics to the graphics buffer by setting the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics.Graphics%2A> property. For example:  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#22](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/CS/Class1.cs#22)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#22](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/VB/Class1.vb#22)]  \n  \n4.  When you have completed all of your drawing operations to the graphics buffer, call the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics.Render%2A> method to render the buffer, either to the drawing surface associated with that buffer, or to a specified drawing surface, as shown in the following code example.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#23](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/CS/Class1.cs#23)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#23](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/VB/Class1.vb#23)]  \n  \n5.  After you are finished rendering graphics, call the `Dispose` method on the <xref:System.Drawing.BufferedGraphics> instance to free system resources.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics#24](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.LegacyBufferedGraphics/CS/Class1.cs#24)]\n
