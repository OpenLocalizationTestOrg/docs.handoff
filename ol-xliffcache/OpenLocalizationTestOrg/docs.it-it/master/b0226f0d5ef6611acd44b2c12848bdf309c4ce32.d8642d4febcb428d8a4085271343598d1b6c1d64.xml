Conditional compilation statements are designed to run during compile time, not at run time.  \n  \n You denote blocks of code to be conditionally compiled with the `#If...Then...#Else` directive. For example, to create French- and German-language versions of the same application from the same source code, you embed platform-specific code segments in `#If...Then` statements using the predefined constants `FrenchVersion` and `GermanVersion`. The following example demonstrates how:  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrConditionalComp#5](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/directives/codesnippet/VisualBasic/conditional-compilation_1.vb)]  \n  \n If you set the value of the `FrenchVersion` conditional compilation constant to `True` at compile time, the conditional code for the French version is compiled. If you set the value of the `GermanVersion` constant to `True`, the compiler uses the German version. If neither is set to `True`, the code in the last `Else` block runs.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Autocompletion will not function when editing code and using conditional compilation directives if the code is not part of the current branch.  \n  \n## Declaring Conditional Compilation Constants  \n You can set conditional compilation constants in one of three ways:  \n  \n-   In the **Project Designer**  \n  \n-   At the command line when using the command-line compiler  \n  \n-   In your code  \n  \n Conditional compilation constants have a special scope and cannot be accessed from standard code. The scope of a conditional compilation constant is dependent on the way it is set. The following table lists the scope of constants declared using each of the three ways mentioned above.  \n  \n|How constant is set|Scope of constant|  \n|---|---|  \n|**Project Designer**|Public to all files in the project|  \n|Command line|Public to all files passed to the command-line compiler|  \n|`#Const` statement in code|Private to the file in which it is declared|  \n  \n|To set constants in the Project Designer|  \n|---|  \n|-   Before creating your executable file, set constants in the **Project Designer** by following the steps provided in [NIB How to: Modify Project Properties and Configuration Settings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e7184bc5-2f2b-4b4f-aa9a-3ecfcbc48b67).|  \n  \n|To set constants at the command line|  \n|---|  \n|-   Use the **/d** switch to enter conditional compilation constants, as in the following example:<br />     `vbc MyProj.vb /d:conFrenchVersion=â€“1:conANSI=0`<br />     No space is required between the **/d** switch and the first constant. For more information, see [/define (Visual Basic)](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/define.md).<br />     Command-line declarations override declarations entered in the **Project Designer**, but do not erase them. Arguments set in **Project Designer** remain in effect for subsequent compilations.<br />     When writing constants in the code itself, there are no strict rules as to their placement, since their scope is the entire module in which they are declared.|  \n  \n|To set constants in your code|  \n|---|  \n|-   Place the constants in the declaration block of the module in which they are used.
