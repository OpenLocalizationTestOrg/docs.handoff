The numbers that specify the world transformation are stored in a <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix> object, which represents a 3×3 matrix. The <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix> and <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> classes have several methods for setting the numbers in the world transformation matrix.  \n  \n## Different Types of Transformations  \n In the following example, the code first creates a 50×50 rectangle and locates it at the origin (0, 0). The origin is at the upper-left corner of the client area.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n The following code applies a scaling transformation that expands the rectangle by a factor of 1.75 in the x direction and shrinks the rectangle by a factor of 0.5 in the y direction:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#12)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#12](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#12)]  \n  \n The result is a rectangle that is longer in the x direction and shorter in the y direction than the original.  \n  \n To rotate the rectangle instead of scaling it, use the following code:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#13](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#13)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#13](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#13)]  \n  \n To translate the rectangle, use the following code:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#14](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#14)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#14](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#14)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Drawing2D.Matrix>   \n [Coordinate Systems and Transformations](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/coordinate-systems-and-transformations.md)   \n [Using Transformations in Managed GDI+](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-transformations-in-managed-gdi.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,486],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using the World Transformation | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
