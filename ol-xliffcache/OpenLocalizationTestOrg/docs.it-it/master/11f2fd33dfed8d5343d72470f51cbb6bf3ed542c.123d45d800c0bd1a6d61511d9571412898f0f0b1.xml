Each `Student` object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations.  \n  \n This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same `students` data source.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following query returns the students who received a score of 90 or greater on their first exam.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csProgGuideLINQ#15](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-query-a-collection-of-objects_1.cs)]  \n  \n This query is intentionally simple to enable you to experiment. For example, you can try more conditions in the `where` clause, or use an `orderby` clause to sort the results.  \n  \n\n## See also  \n [LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,326],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Query a collection of objects\"\ndescription: How query collections.\nkeywords: .NET, .NET Core, C#\nauthor: BillWagner\nmanager: wpickett\nms.author: wiwagn\nms.date: 11/30/2016\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: .net-core\nms.technology: .net-core-technologies\nms.devlang: dotnet\nms.assetid: 87a76f8a-0b58-4791-90ea-2fe0a30416c9","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects","nodes":[{"pos":[0,29],"content":"Query a collection of objects","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects","pos":[0,29]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"How query collections.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"How query collections.","nodes":[{"content":"How query collections.","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["description"]},{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","nodes":[{"pos":[0,19],"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","nodes":[{"content":".NET, .NET Core, C#","pos":[0,19]}]}],"path":["keywords"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[333,362],"content":"Query a collection of objects","linkify":"Query a collection of objects","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to perform a simple query over a list of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Student`</ph> objects.","pos":[363,445],"source":"This example shows how to perform a simple query over a list of `Student` objects."},{"content":"Each <ph id=\"ph1\">`Student`</ph> object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations.","pos":[446,588],"source":" Each `Student` object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations."},{"pos":[595,717],"content":"This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same <ph id=\"ph1\">`students`</ph> data source.","source":"This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same `students` data source."},{"pos":[726,733],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following query returns the students who received a score of 90 or greater on their first exam.","pos":[737,836]},{"content":"This query is intentionally simple to enable you to experiment.","pos":[970,1033]},{"content":"For example, you can try more conditions in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`where`</ph> clause, or use an <ph id=\"ph2\">`orderby`</ph> clause to sort the results.","pos":[1034,1145],"source":" For example, you can try more conditions in the `where` clause, or use an `orderby` clause to sort the results."},{"pos":[1155,1163],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1167,1201],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ Query Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ Query Expressions](index.md)"}]}
