Unless specified otherwise in the following tables, these changes do not affect binaries that target a previous version of the .NET Framework but are running under version 4.5.2. The .NET Framework 4.5.2 includes retargeting changes in the following areas:  \n  \n-   [Entity Framework](#EF)  \n  \n-   [Windows Forms](#WinForms)  \n  \n<a name=\"EF\"></a>   \n## Entity Framework retargeting changes  \n  \n|Feature|Change|Impact|Scope|  \n|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|  \n|Simpler queries when using unsorted limiting operations|Queries that produce `JOIN` statements and contain a call to a limiting operation without first using <xref:System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery%601.OrderBy%2A> now produce simpler SQL.
