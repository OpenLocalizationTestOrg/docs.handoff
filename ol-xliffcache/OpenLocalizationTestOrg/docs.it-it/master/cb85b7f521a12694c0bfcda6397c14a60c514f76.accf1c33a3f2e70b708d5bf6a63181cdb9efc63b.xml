They also contain methods for opening, closing, moving, and deleting files and folders. You can create instances of these classes by passing a string that represents the name of the file, folder, or drive in to the constructor:  \n  \n```csharp  \nSystem.IO.DriveInfo di = new System.IO.DriveInfo(@\"C:\\\");  \n```  \n  \n You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n The <xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows various ways to access information about files and folders.  \n  \n [!code-cs[csFilesandFolders#6](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-get-information-about-files-folders-and-drives_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n When you process user-specified path strings, you should also handle exceptions for the following conditions:  \n  \n-   The file name is malformed. For example, it contains invalid characters or only white space.  \n  \n-   The file name is null.  \n  \n-   The file name is longer than the system-defined maximum length.  \n  \n-   The file name contains a colon (:).  \n  \n If the application does not have sufficient permissions to read the specified file, the `Exists` method returns `false` regardless of whether a path exists; the method does not throw an exception.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=fullName>   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,109],"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,97]}]},{"pos":[603,683],"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","linkify":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Get Information About Files, Folders, and Drives  (C# Programming Guide)","pos":[0,80]}]},{"content":"In the .NET Framework, you can access file system information by using the following classes:","pos":[684,777]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.FileInfo&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo&gt;</ph> classes represent a file or directory and contain properties that expose many of the file attributes that are supported by the NTFS file system.","pos":[1087,1296],"source":"The <xref:System.IO.FileInfo> and <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo> classes represent a file or directory and contain properties that expose many of the file attributes that are supported by the NTFS file system."},{"content":"They also contain methods for opening, closing, moving, and deleting files and folders.","pos":[1297,1384]},{"content":"You can create instances of these classes by passing a string that represents the name of the file, folder, or drive in to the constructor:","pos":[1385,1524]},{"content":"You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1612,1906],"source":"You can also obtain the names of files, folders, or drives by using calls to <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetDirectories%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.IO.DriveInfo.RootDirectory%2A?displayProperty=fullName>."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files.","pos":[1913,2106],"source":"The <xref:System.IO.Directory?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.IO.File?displayProperty=fullName> classes provide static methods for retrieving information about directories and files."},{"pos":[2115,2122],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example shows various ways to access information about files and folders.","pos":[2126,2213]},{"pos":[2220,2376],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-cs</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>csFilesandFolders#6<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-get-information-about-files-folders-and-drives_1.cs)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-cs[csFilesandFolders#6](../../../csharp/programming-guide/file-system/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-get-information-about-files-folders-and-drives_1.cs)]"},{"pos":[2385,2403],"content":"Robust Programming","linkify":"Robust Programming","nodes":[{"content":"Robust Programming","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"When you process user-specified path strings, you should also handle exceptions for the following conditions:","pos":[2407,2516]},{"content":"The file name is malformed.","pos":[2526,2553]},{"content":"For example, it contains invalid characters or only white space.","pos":[2554,2618]},{"content":"The file name is null.","pos":[2628,2650]},{"content":"The file name is longer than the system-defined maximum length.","pos":[2660,2723]},{"content":"The file name contains a colon (:).","pos":[2733,2768]},{"pos":[2775,2971],"content":"If the application does not have sufficient permissions to read the specified file, the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Exists`</ph> method returns <ph id=\"ph2\">`false`</ph> regardless of whether a path exists;
