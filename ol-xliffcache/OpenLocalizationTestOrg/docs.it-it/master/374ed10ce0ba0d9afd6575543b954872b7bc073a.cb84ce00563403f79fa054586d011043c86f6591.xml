If the base class has a constructor with no parameters that is accessible to derived classes, `MyBase.New` can be called automatically. If not, a base class constructor must be called with parameters, and this cannot be done automatically. In this case, the first statement of every derived class constructor must call a parameterized constructor on the base class, or call another constructor in the derived class that makes a base class constructor call.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30148  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Either call `MyBase.New` supplying the required parameters, or call a peer constructor that makes such a call.  \n  \n     For example, if the base class has a constructor that’s declared as `Public Sub New(ByVal index as Integer)`, the first statement in the derived class constructor might be `MyBase.New(100)`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Inheritance Basics](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,181],"content":"First statement of this &#39;Sub New&#39;
