For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To create a Windows Explorer-style Windows Form  \n  \n1.  Create a new Windows Application project. For details, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  \n  \n2.  From the **Toolbox**:  \n  \n    1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control onto your form.  \n  \n    2.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control into **SplitterPanel1** (the panel of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control marked **Panel1**).  \n  \n    3.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control into **SplitterPanel2** (the panel of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control marked **Panel2**).  \n  \n3.  Select all three controls by pressing the CTRL key and clicking them in turn. When you select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control, click the splitter bar, rather than the panels.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Do not use the **Select All** command on the **Edit** menu. If you do so, the property needed in the next step will not appear in the **Properties** window.  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle>.  \n  \n5.  Press F5 to run the application.  \n  \n     The form displays a two-part user interface, similar to that of the Windows Explorer.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  When you drag the splitter, the panels resize themselves.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>   \n [How to: Create a Multipane User Interface with Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-multipane-user-interface-with-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-define-resize-and-positioning-behavior-in-a-split-window.md)   \n [How to: Split a Window Horizontally](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-split-a-window-horizontally.md)   \n [SplitContainer Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/splitcontainer-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,607],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,84],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,84]}]}],"pos":[6,93],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Explorer, creating with Windows Forms\"\n  - \"SplitContainer control [Windows Forms], Explorer-style interface\"\n  - \"forms, Windows Explorer type\"\nms.assetid: 9a3d5f4f-5dda-4350-9ad5-57ce5976dc47\ncaps.latest.revision: 15\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[614,681],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","linkify":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Explorer–Style Interface on a Windows Form","pos":[0,67]}]},{"content":"Windows Explorer is a common user-interface choice for applications because of its ready familiarity.","pos":[682,783]},{"content":"Windows Explorer is, essentially, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control and a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView&gt;</ph> control on separate panels.","pos":[790,941],"source":"Windows Explorer is, essentially, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ListView> control on separate panels."},{"content":"The panels are made resizable by a splitter.","pos":[942,986]},{"content":"This arrangement of controls is very effective for displaying and browsing information.","pos":[987,1074]},{"content":"The following steps show how to arrange controls in a Windows Explorer-like form.","pos":[1081,1162]},{"content":"They do not show how to add the file-browsing functionality of the Windows Explorer application.","pos":[1163,1259]},{"pos":[1267,1643],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
