The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class has several <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> methods that allow you to specify various features of text, such as location, bounding rectangle, font, and format. In addition, you can draw and measure text with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] using the static <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.MeasureText%2A> methods offered by the `TextRenderer` class. The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] methods also allow you to specify location, font, and format. You can choose either [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] for text rendering; however, [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] generally offers better performance and more accurate text measuring. Other classes that contribute to text rendering include `FontFamily`, `Font`, <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat>, and `TextFormatFlags`.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Construct Font Families and Fonts](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-construct-font-families-and-fonts.md)  \n Shows how to create `Font` and `FontFamily` objects.  \n  \n [How to: Draw Text at a Specified Location](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-text-at-a-specified-location.md)  \n Describes how to draw text in a certain location using

Rectangle](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-wrapped-text-in-a-rectangle.md)  \n Explains how to draw text in a rectangle using [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Draw Text with GDI](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] for drawing text.  \n  \n [How to: Align Drawn Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-align-drawn-text.md)  \n Shows how to format [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] text.  \n  \n [How to: Create Vertical Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-vertical-text.md)  \n Describes how to draw vertically aligned text with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Set Tab Stops in Drawn Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-set-tab-stops-in-drawn-text.md)  \n Shows how draw text with tab stops with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n [How to: Enumerate Installed Fonts](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-enumerate-installed-fonts.md)  \n Explains how to list the names of installed fonts.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Private Font Collection](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-create-a-private-font-collection.md)  \n Describes how to create a <xref:System.Drawing.Text.PrivateFontCollection> object.  \n  \n [How to: Obtain Font Metrics](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-obtain-font-metrics.md)  \n Shows how to obtain font metrics such as cell ascent and descent.  \n  \n [How to: Use Antialiasing with Text](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-use-antialiasing-with-text.md)  \n Explains how to use antialiasing when drawing text.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Font>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.  \n  \n
