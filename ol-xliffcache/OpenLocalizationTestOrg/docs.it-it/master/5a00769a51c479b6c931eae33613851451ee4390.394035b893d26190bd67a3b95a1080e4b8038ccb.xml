You can also build this example in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] by pasting the code into a new project.  Also see [How to: Compile and Run a Complete Windows Forms Code Example Using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Bb129228\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n File operations should be enclosed within appropriate exception-handling blocks.  \n  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The path name is malformed. For example, it contains characters that are not valid or is only white space (<xref:System.ArgumentException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException> class).  \n  \n-   The path name is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException> class).  \n  \n-   The path name is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is not valid (<xref:System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException> class).  \n  \n-   The path is only a colon \":\" (<xref:System.NotSupportedException> class).  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n Do not make decisions about the contents of the file based on the name of the file. For example, the file `Form1.vb` may not be a Visual Basic source file. Verify all inputs before using the data in your application.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer.LoadAsync%2A>   \n <xref:System.Media.SoundPlayer.LoadCompleted>   \n
