Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use. Grouping all options in a panel gives the user a logical visual cue. At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, all its contained controls move, too. The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> property. This property returns a collection of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type.  \n  \n## Panel Versus GroupBox  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control; however, only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control can have scroll bars, and only the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control displays a caption.  \n  \n## Key Properties  \n To display scroll bars, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl.AutoScroll%2A> property to `true`. You can also customize the appearance of the panel by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> properties. For more information on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage%2A> properties, see [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md). The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle%2A> property determines if the panel is outlined with no visible border (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.None>), a plain line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.FixedSingle>), or a shadowed line (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle.Fixed3D>).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel>\n- [GroupBox Control](groupbox-control-windows-forms.md)\n- [How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer](group-controls-with-wf-panel-control-using-the-designer.md)\n- [How to: Set the Background of a Windows Forms Panel Using the Designer](how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel-using-the-designer.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,282],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"Panel\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"grouping controls [Windows Forms], Panel control\"\n  - \"Panel control [Windows Forms], about Panel control\"\nms.assetid: b6b83636-2c39-4dad-89d6-f0fa41049a74","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[289,327],"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Control Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls.","pos":[328,449],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other controls."},{"content":"Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function.","pos":[450,508]},{"content":"For example, you may have an order form that specifies mailing options such as which overnight carrier to use.","pos":[509,619]},{"content":"Grouping all options in a panel gives the user a logical visual cue.","pos":[620,688]},{"content":"At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control, all its contained controls move, too.","pos":[689,841],"source":" At design time all the controls can be moved easily — when you move the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, all its contained controls move, too."},{"content":"The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A&gt;</ph> property.","pos":[842,959],"source":" The controls grouped in a panel can be accessed through its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Controls%2A> property."},{"content":"This property returns a collection of <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control&gt;</ph> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type.","pos":[960,1130],"source":" This property returns a collection of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control> instances, so you will typically need to cast a control retrieved this way to its specific type."},{"pos":[1139,1160],"content":"Panel Versus GroupBox","linkify":"Panel Versus GroupBox","nodes":[{"content":"Panel Versus GroupBox","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[1164,1433],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> control is similar to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox&gt;</ph> control;
