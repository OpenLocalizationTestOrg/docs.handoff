diagonal lines, rectangles, squares, ovals, circles, and rectangles and squares with rounded corners on a form or container.  \n  \n The PowerPack controls are no longer included in Visual Studio, but you can download them from the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=25169).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Introduction to the Line and Shape Controls](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/introduction-to-the-line-and-shape-controls-visual-studio.md)  \n Introduces and discusses the Line and Shape controls and describes the object model.  \n  \n [How to: Draw Lines with the LineShape Control](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/how-to-draw-lines-with-the-lineshape-control-visual-studio.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.LineShape> control to draw lines at design time and at run time.  \n  \n [How to: Draw Shapes with the OvalShape and RectangleShape Controls](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/how-to-draw-shapes-with-the-ovalshape-and-rectangleshape-controls.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.OvalShape> and <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.RectangleShape> controls to draw shapes at design time and at run time.  \n  \n [How to: Enable Tabbing Between Shapes](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/windows-forms/how-to-enable-tabbing-between-shapes-visual-studio.md)  \n Demonstrates how to enable users to move between shapes by using the keyboard.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"Line and Shape Controls (Visual Studio) | Microsoft
