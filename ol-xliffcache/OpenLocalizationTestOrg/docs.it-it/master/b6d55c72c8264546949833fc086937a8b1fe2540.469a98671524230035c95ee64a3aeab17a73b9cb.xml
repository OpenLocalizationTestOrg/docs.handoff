If you display the tooltip for one of the ellipses and then move the mouse pointer to another ellipse within two seconds and pause on it, the tooltip of the second ellipse displays immediately.  \n  \n In either of the following scenarios, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.InitialShowDelay%2A> applies, which causes the tooltip for the second ellipse to wait one second before it appears:  \n  \n-   If the time it takes to move to the second button is more than two seconds.  \n  \n-   If the tooltip is not visible at the beginning of the time interval for the first ellipse.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[ToolTipService#ToolTip](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ToolTipService/CSharp/Pane1.xaml#tooltip)]  \n[!code-xaml[ToolTipService#NoToolTip](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/ToolTipService/CSharp/Pane1.xaml#notooltip)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTip>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService>\n- [How-to Topics](tooltip-how-to-topics.md)\n- [ToolTip Overview](tooltip-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,250],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ToolTip control [WPF], BetweenShowDelay time property\"\n  - \"BetweenShowDelay time property [WPF]\"\nms.assetid: 984ea76d-f2a2-4326-a02e-f97ec3d036d6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","nodes":[{"pos":[0,41],"content":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","pos":[0,41]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[257,298],"content":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","linkify":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use the BetweenShowDelay Property","pos":[0,41]}]},{"pos":[299,542],"content":"This example shows how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.BetweenShowDelay%2A&gt;</ph> time property so that tooltips appear quickly—with little or no delay—when a user moves the mouse pointer from one tooltip directly to another.","source":"This example shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.BetweenShowDelay%2A> time property so that tooltips appear quickly—with little or no delay—when a user moves the mouse pointer from one tooltip directly to another."},{"pos":[551,558],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following example, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.InitialShowDelay%2A&gt;</ph> property is set to one second (1000 milliseconds) and the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.BetweenShowDelay%2A&gt;</ph> is set to two seconds (2000 milliseconds) for the tooltips of both <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse&gt;</ph> controls.","pos":[562,895],"source":"In the following example, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.InitialShowDelay%2A> property is set to one second (1000 milliseconds) and the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.BetweenShowDelay%2A> is set to two seconds (2000 milliseconds) for the tooltips of both <xref:System.Windows.Shapes.Ellipse> controls."},{"content":"If you display the tooltip for one of the ellipses and then move the mouse pointer to another ellipse within two seconds and pause on it, the tooltip of the second ellipse displays immediately.","pos":[896,1089]},{"pos":[1096,1298],"content":"In either of the following scenarios, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.InitialShowDelay%2A&gt;</ph> applies, which causes the tooltip for the second ellipse to wait one second before it appears:","source":"In either of the following scenarios, the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTipService.InitialShowDelay%2A> applies, which causes the tooltip for the second ellipse to wait one second before it appears:"},{"content":"If the time it takes to move to the second button is more than two seconds.","pos":[1308,1383]},{"content":"If the tooltip is not visible at the beginning of the time interval for the first ellipse.","pos":[1393,1483]},{"pos":[1746,1754],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1847,1888],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How-to Topics<ept id=\"p1\">](tooltip-how-to-topics.md)</ept>","source":"[How-to Topics](tooltip-how-to-topics.md)"},{"pos":[1891,1930],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>ToolTip Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](tooltip-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[ToolTip Overview](tooltip-overview.md)"}]}
