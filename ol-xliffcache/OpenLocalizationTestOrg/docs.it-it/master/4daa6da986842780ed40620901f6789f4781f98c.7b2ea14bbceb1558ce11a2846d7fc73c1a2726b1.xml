This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>. You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xml[Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationexamplewholepage)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation>   \n [Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)   \n [3-D Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/3-d-graphics-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,88],"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,76]}]},{"pos":[696,755],"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","linkify":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Animate Camera Position and Direction in a 3D Scene","pos":[0,59]}]},{"content":"The following example shows how to animate the position of a camera and animate the direction it is pointing in a 3D scene.","pos":[756,879]},{"content":"This is done by using <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation&gt;</ph> to animate the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A&gt;</ph> properties respectively of the <ph id=\"ph5\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera&gt;</ph>.","pos":[880,1256],"source":" This is done by using <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Point3DAnimation> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Vector3DAnimation> to animate the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.Position%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.ProjectionCamera.LookDirection%2A> properties respectively of the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Media3D.PerspectiveCamera>."},{"content":"You might use an animation like this to change the onlooker's view of a scene in response to an event.","pos":[1257,1359]},{"pos":[1368,1375],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1379,1608],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[!code-xml</bpt><bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationExampleWholePage<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationexamplewholepage)</ept><ept id=\"p1\">]</ept>","source":"[!code-xml[Animation3DGallery_snip#PointVector3DAnimationExampleWholePage](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/Animation3DGallery_snip/CS/PointVector3DAnimationExample.xaml#pointvector3danimationexamplewholepage)]"},{"pos":[1617,1625],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1747,1922],"source":" [Animate Camera Position and Direction Using Key Frames](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/how-to-animate-camera-position-and-direction-using-key-frames.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>3-D Graphics Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/3-d-graphics-overview.md)</ept>","pos":[1925,2026],"source":" [3-D Graphics Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/graphics-multimedia/3-d-graphics-overview.md)"}]}
