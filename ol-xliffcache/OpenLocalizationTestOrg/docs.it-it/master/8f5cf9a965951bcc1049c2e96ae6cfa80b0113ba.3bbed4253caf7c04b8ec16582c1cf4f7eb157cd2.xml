The topics in this section discuss the security implications to consider when creating a reliable session. For more information about reliable sessions, see [Using Sessions](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/using-sessions.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When impersonation is required on Windows XP, use a secure session without a stateful security context token (SCT). When stateful SCTs are used with impersonation, an <xref:System.InvalidOperationException> is thrown.
