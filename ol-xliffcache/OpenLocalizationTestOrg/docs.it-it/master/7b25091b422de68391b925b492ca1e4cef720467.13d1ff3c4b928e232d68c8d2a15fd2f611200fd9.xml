Also, the dereference operator, which allows reading and writing to a pointer.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n All numeric types have predefined multiplication operators.  \n  \n The `*` operator is also used to declare pointer types and to dereference pointers. This operator can only be used in unsafe contexts, denoted by the use of the [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) keyword, and requiring the [/unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/unsafe-compiler-option.md) compiler option.  The dereference operator is also known as the indirection operator.  \n  \n User-defined types can overload the binary `*` operator (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)). When a binary operator is overloaded, the corresponding assignment operator, if any, is also implicitly overloaded.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csRefOperators#50](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/multiplication-operator_1.cs)]  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csRefOperators#51](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/codesnippet/CSharp/multiplication-operator_2.cs)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Unsafe Code and Pointers](../../../csharp/programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/index.md)   \n [C# Operators](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,589],"nodes":[{"content":"* Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[2,42],"content":"Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]}],"pos":[6,51],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"* Operator (C# Reference) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: \n  -
