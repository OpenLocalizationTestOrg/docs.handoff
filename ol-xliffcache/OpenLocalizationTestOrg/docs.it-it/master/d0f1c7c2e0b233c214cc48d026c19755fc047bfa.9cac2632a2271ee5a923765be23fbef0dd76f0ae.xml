It accepts one of the following values:\n\n  * `all` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied to all cache types: http-request cache, global packages cache, and the temporary cache.\n  * `http-cache` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied only to the http-request cache. The other cache locations aren't affected.\n  * `global-packages` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied only to the global packages cache. The other cache locations aren't affected.\n  * `temp` - Indicates that the specified operation is applied only to the temporary cache. The other cache locations aren't affected.\n\n## Options\n\n* **`--force-english-output`**\n\n  Forces the application to run using an invariant, English-based culture.\n\n* **`-h|--help`**\n\n  Prints out a short help for the command.\n\n* **`-c|--clear`**\n\n  The clear option executes a clear operation on the specified cache type. The contents of the cache directories are deleted recursively. The executing user/group must have permission to the files in the cache directories. If not, an error is displayed indicating the files/folders that weren't cleared.\n\n* **`-l|--list`**\n\n  The list option is used to display the location of the specified cache type.\n\n## Examples\n\n* Displays the paths of all the local cache directories (http-cache directory, global-packages cache directory, and temporary cache directory):\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet nuget locals â€“l all\n  ```\n\n* Displays the path for the local http-cache directory:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet nuget locals --list http-cache\n  ```\n\n* Clears all files from all local cache directories (http-cache directory, global-packages cache directory, and temporary cache directory):\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet nuget locals --clear all\n  ```\n\n* Clears all files in local global-packages cache directory:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet nuget locals -c global-packages\n  ```\n\n* Clears all files in local temporary cache directory:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet nuget locals -c temp\n  ```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor information on common problems and errors while using the `dotnet nuget locals` command, see [Managing the NuGet cache](/nuget/consume-packages/managing-the-nuget-cache).","nodes":[{"pos":[4,246],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: dotnet nuget locals command\ndescription: The dotnet nuget locals command clears or lists local NuGet resources such as http-request cache, temporary cache, or machine-wide global packages folder.\nauthor: karann-msft\nms.date: 12/04/2018","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet nuget locals command","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"dotnet nuget locals command","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet nuget locals command","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"The dotnet nuget locals command clears or lists local NuGet resources such as http-request cache, temporary cache, or machine-wide global packages folder.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,154],"content":"The dotnet nuget locals command clears or lists local NuGet resources such as http-request cache, temporary cache, or machine-wide global packages folder.","nodes":[{"content":"The dotnet nuget locals command clears or lists local NuGet resources such as http-request cache, temporary cache, or machine-wide global packages folder.","pos":[0,154]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[253,272],"content":"dotnet nuget locals","linkify":"dotnet nuget locals","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet nuget locals","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[371,375],"content":"Name","linkify":"Name","nodes":[{"content":"Name","pos":[0,4]}]},{"pos":[377,439],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet nuget locals`</ph> -
