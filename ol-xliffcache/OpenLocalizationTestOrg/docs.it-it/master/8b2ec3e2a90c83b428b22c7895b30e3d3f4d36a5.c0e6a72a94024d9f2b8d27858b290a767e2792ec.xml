In the previous topic, [How to: Implement a Discoverable Service that Registers with the Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/discoverable-service-that-registers-with-the-discovery-proxy.md), you implemented a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that registers itself with the discovery proxy. In this topic you create a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] client that uses the discovery proxy to find the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service.  \n  \n### Implement the client  \n  \n1.  Add a new console application project to the `DiscoveryProxyExample` solution called `Client`.  \n  \n2.  Add references to the following assemblies:  \n  \n    1.  System.ServiceModel  \n  \n    2.  System.ServiceModel.Discovery  \n  \n3.  Add the GeneratedClient.cs found at the bottom of this topic to the project.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This file is usually generated using a tool such as Svcutil.exe. It is provided in this topic to simplify the task.  \n  \n4.  Open the Program.cs file and add the following method. This method takes an endpoint address and uses it to initialize the service client (proxy).  \n  \n    ```  \n    static void InvokeCalculatorService(EndpointAddress endpointAddress)  \n            {  \n                // Create a client  \n                CalculatorServiceClient client = new CalculatorServiceClient(new NetTcpBinding(), endpointAddress);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Invoking CalculatorService at {0}\", endpointAddress.Uri);  \n                Console.WriteLine();  \n  \n                double value1 = 100.00D;  \n                double value2 = 15.99D;  \n  \n                // Call the Add service operation.  \n                double result = client.Add(value1, value2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Add({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n                // Call the Subtract service operation.  \n                result = client.Subtract(value1, value2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n                // Call the Multiply service operation.  \n                result = client.Multiply(value1, value2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n  \n                // Call the Divide service operation.  \n                result = client.Divide(value1, value2);  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Divide({0},{1}) = {2}\", value1, value2, result);  \n                Console.WriteLine();  \n  \n                // Closing the client gracefully closes the connection and cleans up resources  \n                client.Close();  \n            }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Add the following code to the `Main` method.  \n  \n    ```  \n    public static void Main()  \n            {  \n                // Create a DiscoveryEndpoint that points to the DiscoveryProxy  \n                Uri probeEndpointAddress = new Uri(\"net.tcp://localhost:8001/Probe\");  \n                DiscoveryEndpoint discoveryEndpoint = new DiscoveryEndpoint(new NetTcpBinding(), new EndpointAddress(probeEndpointAddress));  \n  \n                // Create a DiscoveryClient passing in the discovery endpoint  \n                DiscoveryClient discoveryClient = new DiscoveryClient(discoveryEndpoint);  \n  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Finding ICalculatorService endpoints using the proxy at {0}\", probeEndpointAddress);  \n                Console.WriteLine();  \n  \n                try  \n                {  \n                    // Search for services that implement ICalculatorService              \n                    FindResponse findResponse = discoveryClient.Find(new FindCriteria(typeof(ICalculatorService)));  \n  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"Found {0} ICalculatorService endpoint(s).\", findResponse.Endpoints.Count);  \n                    Console.WriteLine();  \n  \n                    // Check to see if endpoints were found, if so then invoke the service.  \n                    if (findResponse.Endpoints.Count > 0)  \n                    {  \n                        InvokeCalculatorService(findResponse.Endpoints[0].Address);  \n                    }  \n                }  \n                catch (TargetInvocationException)  \n                {  \n                    Console.WriteLine(\"This client was unable to connect to and query the proxy. Ensure that the proxy is up and running.\");  \n                }  \n  \n                Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to exit.\");  \n                Console.ReadLine();  \n            }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n You have completed implementing the client application. Continue on to [How to: Test the Discovery Proxy](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-test-the-discovery-proxy.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n This is the full code listing for this topic.  \n  \n```  \n// GeneratedClient.cs  \n//----------------------------------------------------------------  \n// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
