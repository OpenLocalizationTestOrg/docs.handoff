Frequently, these graphics take the form of an employee's photograph or a company logo.  \n  \n Incorporating pictures is simple when you display data within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control natively handles any image format supported by the <xref:System.Drawing.Image> class, as well as the OLE picture format used by some databases.  \n  \n If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's data source has a column of images, they will be displayed automatically by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.  \n  \n The following code example demonstrates how to extract an icon from an embedded resource and convert it to a bitmap for display in every cell of an image column. For another example that replaces textual cell values with corresponding images, see [How to: Customize Data Formatting in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](how-to-customize-data-formatting-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#050](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/CS/datagridviewmisc.cs#050)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#050](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/VB/datagridviewmisc.vb#050)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control named `dataGridView1`.  \n  \n-   An embedded icon resource named `tree.ico`.  \n  \n-   References to the <xref:System?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Drawing?displayProperty=nameWithType> assemblies.  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
