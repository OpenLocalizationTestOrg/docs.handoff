The following examples demonstrate how to use embedded expressions to populate element content, attributes, and element names at run time.  \n  \n The syntax for an embedded expression is `<%=` `exp` `%>`, which is the same syntax that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](~/includes/vstecasp-md.md)] uses. For more information, see [Embedded Expressions in XML](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/xml/embedded-expressions-in-xml.md).  \n  \n You can also use the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] APIs to create [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](~/includes/sqltecxlinq-md.md)] objects. For more information, see <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>.  \n  \n## Procedures  \n  \n#### To insert text as element content  \n  \n-   The following example shows how to insert the text that is contained in the `contactName` variable between the opening and closing name elements.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbXMLSamples#39](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbXMLSamples/VB/XMLSamples14.vb#39)]  \n  \n     This example produces the following output:  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <contact>  \n      <name>Patrick Hines</name>  \n    </contact>  \n    ```  \n  \n#### To insert text as an attribute value  \n  \n-   The following example shows how to insert the text that is contained in the `phoneType` variable as the value of the `type` attribute.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbXMLSamples#40](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbXMLSamples/VB/XMLSamples14.vb#40)]  \n  \n     This example produces the following output:  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <contact>  \n      <phone type=\"home\">206-555-0144</phone>  \n    </contact>  \n    ```  \n  \n#### To insert text for an element name  \n  \n-   The following example shows how to insert the text that is contained in the `elementName` variable as the name of an element.  \n  \n     When creating elements by using this technique, you must close them with the \\</> tag.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbXMLSamples#41](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbXMLSamples/VB/XMLSamples14.vb#41)]  \n  \n     This example produces the following output:  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <contact>  \n      <name>Patrick Hines</name>  \n    </contact>  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Create XML
