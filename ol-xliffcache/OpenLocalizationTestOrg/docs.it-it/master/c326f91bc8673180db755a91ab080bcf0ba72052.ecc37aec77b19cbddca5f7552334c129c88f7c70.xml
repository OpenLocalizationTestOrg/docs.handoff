The contract-first workflow development tool allows you to design the contract in code first. The tool then automatically generates an activity template in the toolbox for the operations in the contract. This topic provides an overview of how the activities and properties in a workflow service map to the attributes of a service contract. For a step-by-step example of creating a contract-first workflow service, see [How to: Create a workflow service that consumes an existing service contract](how-to-create-a-workflow-service-that-consumes-an-existing-service-contract.md).  \n  \n## In this topic  \n  \n-   [Mapping service contract attributes to workflow attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#MappingAttributes)  \n  \n    -   [Service Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#ServiceContract)  \n  \n    -   [Operation Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#OperationContract)  \n  \n    -   [Message Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#MessageContract)  \n  \n    -   [Data Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#DataContract)  \n  \n    -   [Fault Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#FaultContract)  \n  \n-   [Additional Support and Implementation Information](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#AdditionalSupport)  \n  \n    -   [Unsupported service contract features](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#UnsupportedFeatures)  \n  \n    -   [Generation of configured messaging activities](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#ActivityGeneration)  \n  \n## <a name=\"MappingAttributes\"></a> Mapping service contract attributes to workflow attributes  \n The tables in the following sections specify the different WCF attributes and properties and how they are mapped to the messaging activities and properties in a contract-first workflow.  \n  \n-   [Service Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#ServiceContract)  \n  \n-   [Operation Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#OperationContract)  \n  \n-   [Message Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#MessageContract)  \n  \n-   [Data Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#DataContract)  \n  \n-   [Fault Contract Attributes](contract-first-workflow-service-development.md#FaultContract)  \n  \n### <a name=\"ServiceContract\"></a> Service Contract Attributes  \n  \n|Property Name|Supported|Description|WF Validation|  \n|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|  \n|CallbackContract|No|Gets or sets the type of callback contract when the contract is a duplex contract.|(N/A)|  \n|ConfigurationName|No|Gets or sets the name used to locate the service in an application configuration file.|(N/A)|  \n|HasProtectionLevel|Yes|Gets a value that indicates whether the member has a protection level assigned.|Receive.ProtectionLevel should not be null.|  \n|Name|Yes|Gets or sets the name for the \\<portType> element in Web Services Description Language (WSDL).|Receive.ServiceContractName.LocalName should match.|  \n|Namespace|Yes|Gets or sets the namespace of the \\<portType> element in Web Services Description Language (WSDL).|Receive.ServiceContractName.NameSpace should match|  \n|ProtectionLevel|Yes|Specifies whether the binding for the contract must support the value of the ProtectionLevel property.|Receive.ProtectionLevel should match.|  \n|SessionMode|No|Gets or sets whether sessions are allowed, not allowed or required.|(N/A)|  \n|TypeId|No|When implemented in a derived class, gets a unique identifier for this Attribute.
