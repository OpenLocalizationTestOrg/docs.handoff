Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters. Delegates are similar to the concept of function pointers found in some other languages, but unlike function pointers, delegates are object-oriented and type-safe.\n\nThe following example declares and uses a delegate type named `Function`.\n\n[!code-csharp[DelegateExample](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/delegates/Program.cs#L3-L37)]\n\nAn instance of the `Function` delegate type can reference any method that takes a `double` argument and returns a `double` value. The `Apply` method applies a given Function to the elements of a `double[]`, returning a `double[]` with the results. In the `Main` method, `Apply` is used to apply three different functions to a `double[]`.\n\nA delegate can reference either a static method (such as `Square` or `Math.Sin` in the previous example) or an instance method (such as `m.Multiply` in the previous example). A delegate that references an instance method also references a particular object, and when the instance method is invoked through the delegate, that object becomes `this` in the invocation.\n\nDelegates can also be created using anonymous functions, which are \"inline methods\" that are created on the fly. Anonymous functions can see the local variables of the surrounding methods. Thus, the multiplier example above can be written more easily without using a Multiplier class:\n\n[!code-csharp[LambdaExample](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/tour/delegates/Program.cs#L44-L44)]\n\nAn interesting and useful property of a delegate is that it does not know or care about the class of the method it references; all that matters is that the referenced method has the same parameters and return type as the delegate.\n\n>[!div class=\"step-by-step\"]\n[Previous](enums.md)\n[Next](attributes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,343],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: C# Delegates | A tour of the C# language\ndescription: Learn late binding with C# delegates\nkeywords: .NET, csharp, delegate, lambda, late binding\nauthor: BillWagner\nms.author: wiwagn\nms.date: 08/10/2016\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: .net\nms.technology: devlang-csharp\nms.devlang: csharp\nms.assetid: 3cc27357-3ac2-43a1-aad0-86a77b88f884","nodes":[{"content":"C# Delegates | A tour of the C# language","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"C# Delegates | A tour of the C# language","nodes":[{"content":"C# Delegates | A tour of the C# language","pos":[0,40]}]}],"path":["title"]},{"content":"Learn late binding with C# delegates","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"Learn late binding with C# delegates","nodes":[{"content":"Learn late binding with C# delegates","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["description"]},{"content":".NET, csharp, delegate, lambda, late binding","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":".NET, csharp, delegate, lambda, late binding","nodes":[{"content":".NET, csharp, delegate, lambda, late binding","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["keywords"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[351,360],"content":"Delegates","linkify":"Delegates","nodes":[{"content":"Delegates","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"A <bpt id=\"p1\">***</bpt>delegate type<ept id=\"p1\">***</ept> represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.","pos":[362,466],"source":"A ***delegate type*** represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type."},{"content":"Delegates make it possible to treat methods as entities that can be assigned to variables and passed as parameters.","pos":[467,582]},{"content":"Delegates are similar to the concept of function pointers found in some other languages, but unlike function pointers, delegates are object-oriented and type-safe.","pos":[583,746]},{"pos":[748,821],"content":"The following example declares and uses a delegate type named <ph id=\"ph1\">`Function`</ph>.","source":"The following example declares and uses a delegate type named `Function`."},{"content":"An instance of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Function`</ph> delegate type can reference any method that takes a <ph id=\"ph2\">`double`</ph> argument and returns a <ph id=\"ph3\">`double`</ph> value.","pos":[923,1052],"source":"An instance of the `Function` delegate type can reference any method that takes a `double` argument and returns a `double` value."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Apply`</ph> method applies a given Function to the elements of a <ph id=\"ph2\">`double[]`</ph>, returning a <ph id=\"ph3\">`double[]`</ph> with the results.","pos":[1053,1170],"source":" The `Apply` method applies a given Function to the elements of a `double[]`, returning a `double[]` with the results."},{"content":"In the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Main`</ph> method, <ph id=\"ph2\">`Apply`</ph> is used to apply three different functions to a <ph id=\"ph3\">`double[]`</ph>.","pos":[1171,1260],"source":" In the `Main` method, `Apply` is used to apply three different functions to a `double[]`."},{"content":"A delegate can reference either a static method (such as <ph id=\"ph1\">`Square`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`Math.Sin`</ph> in the previous example) or an instance method (such as <ph id=\"ph3\">`m.Multiply`</ph> in the previous example).","pos":[1262,1436],"source":"A delegate can reference either a static method (such as `Square` or `Math.Sin` in the previous example) or an instance method (such as `m.Multiply` in the previous example)."},{"content":"A delegate that references an instance method also references a particular object, and when the instance method is invoked through the delegate, that object becomes <ph id=\"ph1\">`this`</ph> in the invocation.","pos":[1437,1627],"source":" A delegate that references an instance method also references a particular object, and when the instance method is invoked through the delegate, that object becomes `this` in the invocation."},{"content":"Delegates can also be created using anonymous functions, which are \"inline methods\" that are created on the fly.","pos":[1629,1741]},{"content":"Anonymous functions can see the local variables of the surrounding methods.","pos":[1742,1817]},{"content":"Thus, the multiplier example above can be written more easily without using a Multiplier class:","pos":[1818,1913]},{"content":"An interesting and useful property of a delegate is that it does not know or care about the class of the method it references;
