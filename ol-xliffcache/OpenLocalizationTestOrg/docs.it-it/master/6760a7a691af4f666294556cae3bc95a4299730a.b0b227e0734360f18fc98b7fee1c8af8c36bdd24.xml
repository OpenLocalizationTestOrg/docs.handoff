If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one column, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.ColumnSpan%2A> attached property to specify the number of columns. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Top> or <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Bottom> (which alignment you set depends on which two rows you want to resize). Finally, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Stretch>.  \n  \n The following example shows how to define a horizontal <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that resizes adjacent rows.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[GridSplitterRowColumn#GridSplitterRowOverlay](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterRowColumn/CS/Window1.xaml#gridsplitterrowoverlay)]  \n  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that does not occupy its own row may be obscured by other controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>. For more information about how to prevent this issue, see [Make Sure That a GridSplitter Is Visible](how-to-make-sure-that-a-gridsplitter-is-visible.md).  \n  \n **How to create a GridSplitter that occupies a row**  \n  \n To specify a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that occupies a row in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.Row%2A> attached property to one of the rows that you want to resize.
