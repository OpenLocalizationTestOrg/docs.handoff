The property value is also written to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> named `txt1`.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[FlowDirectionSnippets#_FlowDirectionXAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FlowDirectionSnippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml#_flowdirectionxaml)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The events associated with the button clicks defined above are handled in a C# code-behind file.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FlowDirectionSnippets#_FlowDirection](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FlowDirectionSnippets/CSharp/Window1.xaml.cs#_flowdirection)]\n [!code-vb[FlowDirectionSnippets#_FlowDirection](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FlowDirectionSnippets/VisualBasic/Window1.xaml.vb#_flowdirection)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,334],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"FlowDirection property [WPF], changing programmatically\"\n  - \"documents [WPF], changing FlowDirection property programmatically\"\nms.assetid: 02f5a8ba-f8c0-4e5a-84b9-4c5bf12922a2","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","nodes":[{"pos":[0,60],"content":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","pos":[0,60]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[341,401],"content":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","linkify":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Change the FlowDirection of Content Programmatically","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[402,576],"content":"This example shows how to programmatically change the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FlowDirection%2A&gt;</ph> property of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader&gt;</ph>.","source":"This example shows how to programmatically change the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.FlowDirection%2A> property of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader>."},{"pos":[585,592],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"Two <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button&gt;</ph> elements are created, each representing one of the possible values of <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FlowDirection&gt;</ph>.","pos":[596,744],"source":"Two <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button> elements are created, each representing one of the possible values of <xref:System.Windows.FlowDirection>."},{"content":"When a button is clicked, the associated property value is applied to the contents of a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader&gt;</ph> named <ph id=\"ph2\">`tf1`</ph>.","pos":[745,895],"source":" When a button is clicked, the associated property value is applied to the contents of a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader> named `tf1`."},{"content":"The property value is also written to a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock&gt;</ph> named <ph id=\"ph2\">`txt1`</ph>.","pos":[897,991],"source":"  The property value is also written to a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> named `txt1`."},{"pos":[1165,1172],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The events associated with the button clicks defined above are handled in a C# code-behind file.","pos":[1176,1272]}]}
