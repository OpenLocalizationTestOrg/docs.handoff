This is something relevant for NuGet package authors.  See [Reducing Package Dependencies with project.json](../deploying/reducing-dependencies.md) for more information. \n\n## Fix your dependencies to .NET Core 1.0\n\nTo reliably restore packages and write reliable code, it's important that you fix your dependencies to the versions of packages shipping alongside .NET Core 1.0.  This means every package should have a single version with no additional qualifiers.\n\n**Examples of packages fixed to 1.0**\n\n`\"System.Collections\":\"4.0.11\"`\n\n`\"NETStandard.Library\":\"1.6.0\"`\n\n`\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\":\"1.0.0\"`\n\n**Examples of packages that are NOT fixed to 1.0**\n\n`\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\":\"1.0.0-rc4-00454-00\"`\n\n`\"System.Net.Http\":\"4.1.0-*\"`\n\n`\"System.Text.RegularExpressions\":\"4.0.10-rc3-24021-00\"`\n\n### Why does this matter?\n\nWe guarantee that if you fixed your dependencies to what ships alongside .NET Core 1.0, those packages will all work together.  There is no such guarantee if you use packages which aren't fixed in this way.\n\n### Scenarios\n\nAlthough there is a big list of all packages and their versions released with .NET Core 1.0, you may not have to look through it if your code falls under certain scenarios.\n\n**Are you depending only on** `NETStandard.Library`**?**\n\nIf so, you should fixed your `NETStandard.Library` package to version `1.6`.  Because this is a curated metapackage, its package closure is also fixed to 1.0.\n\n**Are you depending only on** `Microsoft.NETCore.App`**?**\n\nIf so, you should fixed your `Microsoft.NETCore.App` package to version `1.0.0`.  Because this is a curated metapackage, its package closure is also fixed to 1.0.\n\n**Are you [trimming](../deploying/reducing-dependencies.md) your** `NETStandard.Library` **or** `Microsoft.NETCore.App` **metapackage dependencies?**\n\nIf so, you should ensure that the metapackage you start with is fixed to 1.0.  The individual packages you depend on after trimming are also fixed to 1.0.\n\n**Are you depending on packages outside the** `NETStandard.Library` **or** `Microsoft.NETCore.App` **metapackages?**\n\nIf so, you need to fix your other dependencies to 1.0.  See the correct package versions and build numbers at the end of this article.\n\n### A note on using a splat string (\\*) when versioning\n\nYou may have adopted a versioning pattern which uses a splat (\\*) string like this:\n`\"System.Collections\":\"4.0.11-*\"`.\n\n**You should not do this**.  Using the splat string could result in restoring packages from different builds, some of which may be further along than .NET Core 1.0.  This could then result in some packages being incompatible.\n\n## Packages and Version Numbers organized by Metapackage\n\n[List of all .NET Standard library packages and their versions for
