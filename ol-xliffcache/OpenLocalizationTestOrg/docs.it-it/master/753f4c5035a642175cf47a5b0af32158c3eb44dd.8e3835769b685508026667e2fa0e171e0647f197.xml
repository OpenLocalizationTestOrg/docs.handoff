Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Bankov, Peter  \n    Holm, Michael  \n    Garcia, Hugo  \n    Potra, Cristina  \n    Noriega, Fabricio  \n    Aw, Kam Foo  \n    Beebe, Ann  \n    Toyoshima, Tim  \n    Guy, Wey Yuan  \n    Garcia, Debra  \n    ```  \n  \n2.
