The `TextBox` control is generally used for editable text, although it can also be made read-only. Text boxes can display multiple lines, wrap text to the size of the control, and add basic formatting. The `TextBox` control allows a single format for text displayed or entered in the control.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [TextBox Control
