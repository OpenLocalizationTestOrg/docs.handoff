The CLR calls the `InitializeHostOverlapped` method to give the host the opportunity to append custom data to an `OVERLAPPED` instance.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  To get to the beginning of their custom data block, hosts must set the offset to the size of the `OVERLAPPED` structure (`sizeof(OVERLAPPED)`).  \n  \n A return value of E_OUTOFMEMORY indicates that the host has failed to initialize its custom data. In this case, the CLR reports an error and fails the call.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n
