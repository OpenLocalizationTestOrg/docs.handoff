Menu item selections are displayed in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.StatusStrip> control.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu#1](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip.StandardMenu/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for Visual Basic or Visual C#, see [Building from the Command Line](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
