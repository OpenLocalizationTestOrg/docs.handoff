A type cannot inherit from a type that inherits from it.  \n  \n A related restriction is that a type cannot inherit from a type that is not yet defined. Inheritance involves the ability to reuse members of the base class, which in turn requires that these members be defined. Therefore, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot compile code such as the following example.  \n  \n```  \nPublic Class outerClass  \n    ' The following statement is INVALID because innerClass is not defined.  \n    Inherits innerClass  \n    Public Class innerClass  \n        Public Sub doSomething()  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \nEnd Class  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30908  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the inheriting type (the outer type in the nesting) must inherit from the inner type, move the inner type out of the outer type.  \n  \n-   If the inner type must be nested within the outer type, the outer type cannot inherit from it.
