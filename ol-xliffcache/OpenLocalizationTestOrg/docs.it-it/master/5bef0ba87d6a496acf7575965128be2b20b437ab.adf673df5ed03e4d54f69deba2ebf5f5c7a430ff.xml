This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment. If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/tb9yt5e6(v=vs.90)).  \n  \n## Key Properties, Methods, and Events  \n The length of the intervals is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property, whose value is in milliseconds. When the component is enabled, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event is raised every interval. This is where you would add code to be executed. For more information, see [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md). The key methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A>, which turn the timer on and off. When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer>\n- [Timer Component](timer-component-windows-forms.md)\n- [Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,277],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"Timer\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Timer component [Windows Forms], about Timer components\"\n  - \"timers [Windows Forms], about timers\"\nms.assetid: e672c05b-a8b6-4b26-9e4d-9223aa9e3873","nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,40],"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,40]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[284,324],"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","linkify":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"Timer Component Overview (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> is a component that raises an event at regular intervals.","pos":[325,434],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> is a component that raises an event at regular intervals."},{"content":"This component is designed for a Windows Forms environment.","pos":[435,494]},{"content":"If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to Server-Based Timers<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/tb9yt5e6(v=vs.90))</ept>.","pos":[495,696],"source":" If you need a timer that is suitable for a server environment, see [Introduction to Server-Based Timers](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2008/tb9yt5e6(v=vs.90))."},{"pos":[705,740],"content":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","linkify":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","nodes":[{"content":"Key Properties, Methods, and Events","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"The length of the intervals is defined by the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A&gt;</ph> property, whose value is in milliseconds.","pos":[744,877],"source":"The length of the intervals is defined by the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Interval%2A> property, whose value is in milliseconds."},{"content":"When the component is enabled, the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick&gt;</ph> event is raised every interval.","pos":[878,983],"source":" When the component is enabled, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Tick> event is raised every interval."},{"content":"This is where you would add code to be executed.","pos":[984,1032]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component<ept id=\"p1\">](run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md)</ept>.","pos":[1033,1200],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Run Procedures at Set Intervals with the Windows Forms Timer Component](run-procedures-at-set-intervals-with-wf-timer-component.md)."},{"content":"The key methods of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> component are <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A&gt;</ph>, which turn the timer on and off.","pos":[1201,1394],"source":" The key methods of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component are <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Start%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer.Stop%2A>, which turn the timer on and off."},{"content":"When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer&gt;</ph> component.","pos":[1395,1509],"source":" When the timer is switched off, it resets; there is no way to pause a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Timer> component."},{"pos":[1518,1526],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1566,1617],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Timer Component<ept id=\"p1\">](timer-component-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Timer Component](timer-component-windows-forms.md)"},{"pos":[1620,1747],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property<ept id=\"p1\">](limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)</ept>","source":"[Limitations of the Windows Forms Timer Component's Interval Property](limitations-of-the-timer-component-interval-property.md)"}]}
