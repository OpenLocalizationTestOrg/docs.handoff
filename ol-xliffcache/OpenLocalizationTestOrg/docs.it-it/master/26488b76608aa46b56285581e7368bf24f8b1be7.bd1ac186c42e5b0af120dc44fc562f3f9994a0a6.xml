These categories can be used to select the appropriate control for your scenario by helping you see which controls have similar usage patterns or functionality.  \n  \n## Layout  \n Layout controls are used to manage the size, dimensions, position, and arrangement of child elements.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.BulletDecorator>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Canvas>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DockPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GroupBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Panel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ResizeGrip>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Separator>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ScrollBar>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ScrollViewer>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StackPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Thumb>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Viewbox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.VirtualizingStackPanel>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Window>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.WrapPanel>  \n  \n## Buttons  \n Buttons are one of the most basic user interface controls. Applications typically perform some task in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.ButtonBase.Click> event when a user clicks on them.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Button>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.RepeatButton>  \n  \n## Data Display  \n Data display controls are used to show information from a data source.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DataGrid>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListView>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TreeView>  \n  \n## Date Display and Selection  \n Date controls are used to display and select calendar information.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Calendar>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DatePicker>  \n  \n## Menus  \n Menus are used to group related actions or to provide contextual assistance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ContextMenu>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Menu>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolBar>  \n  \n## Selection  \n Selection controls are used to enable a user to select one or more options.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>  \n  \n## Navigation  \n Navigation controls enhance or extend the application navigation experience by creating targeting frames or tabbed application appearance.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TabControl>  \n  \n## Dialog Boxes  \n Dialog boxes provide targeted support for common user-interaction scenarios such as printing.  \n  \n-   <xref:Microsoft.Win32.OpenFileDialog>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PrintDialog>  \n  \n-   <xref:Microsoft.Win32.SaveFileDialog>  \n  \n## User Information  \n User information controls provide contextual feedback or clarify an application's user interface. The user typically cannot interact with these controls.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.AccessText>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Label>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.Popup>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ProgressBar>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Primitives.StatusBar>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ToolTip>  \n  \n## Documents  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] includes several specialized controls for viewing documents. These controls optimize the reading experience, based on the targeted user scenario.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.DocumentViewer>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentPageViewer>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentReader>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.FlowDocumentScrollViewer>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.StickyNoteControl>  \n  \n## Input  \n Input controls enable the user to input text and other content.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RichTextBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.PasswordBox>  \n  \n## Media  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] includes integrated support for hosting both audio and video content, as well as [codecs] for most popular image formats.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Image>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.MediaElement>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.SoundPlayerAction>  \n  \n## Digital Ink  \n Digital ink controls provide integrated support for [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_tpc](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-tpc-md.md)] features, such as ink viewing and ink input.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.InkCanvas>  \n  \n-
