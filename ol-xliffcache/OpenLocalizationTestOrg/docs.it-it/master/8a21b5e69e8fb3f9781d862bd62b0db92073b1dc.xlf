        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>There is no absolute rule for when you should mark routed events as handled, either as an application author, or as a control author who responds to existing routed events or implements new routed events.</source>

        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For the most part, the concept of "handled" as carried in the routed event's event data should be used as a limited protocol for your own application's responses to the various routed events exposed in <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> <ph id="ph2">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_api#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-apisharpplural-md.md)]</ph> as well as for any custom routed events.</source>

        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Another way to consider the "handled" issue is that you should generally mark a routed event handled if your code responded to the routed event in a significant and relatively complete way.</source>

        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Typically, there should not be more than one significant response that requires separate handler implementations for any single routed event occurrence.</source>

          <source>If more responses are needed, then the necessary code should be implemented through application logic that is chained within a single handler rather than by using the routed event system for forwarding.</source>

        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Examples of nonsignificant responses include: modifying private state (with no visual impact, or programmatic representation), logging of events, or looking at arguments of an event and choosing not to respond to it.</source>

        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The routed event system behavior reinforces this "significant response" model for using handled state of a routed event, because handlers added in <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> or the common signature of <ph id="ph2">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%2A&gt;</ph> are not invoked in response to a routed event where the event data is already marked handled.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You must go through the extra effort of adding a handler with the <ph id="ph1">`handledEventsToo`</ph> parameter version (<ph id="ph2">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.AddHandler%28System.Windows.RoutedEvent%2CSystem.Delegate%2CSystem.Boolean%29&gt;</ph>) in order to handle routed events that are marked handled by earlier participants in the event route.</source>

          <source>A handled routed event represents a decision by <ph id="ph1">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> control authors that the control's actions in response to the routed event are significant or complete as part of the control implementation, and the event needs no further handling.</source>

          <source>For instance, if for some reason your application had a handler for <ph id="ph1">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown&gt;</ph> located at the application root element, you would notice that any mouse click on a button would not invoke <ph id="ph2">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonDown&gt;</ph> or <ph id="ph3">&lt;xref:System.Windows.UIElement.MouseLeftButtonUp&gt;</ph> handlers at the root level.</source>

        <trans-unit id="210" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The event itself actually did bubble up (again, event routes are not truly ended, but the routed event system changes their handler invocation behavior after being marked handled).</source>
