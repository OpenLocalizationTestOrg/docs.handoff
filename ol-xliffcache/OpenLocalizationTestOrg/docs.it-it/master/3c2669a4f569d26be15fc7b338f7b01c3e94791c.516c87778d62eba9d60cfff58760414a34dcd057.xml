Each domain centralizes authentication and authorization in a security token service. When trust is established between two such services, members of each domain can use the services of the other.  \n  \n For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)\n- [Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,119],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Message Security with Issued Tokens\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 731fc871-54d0-4689-90fd-1c9415c45621","nodes":[{"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","nodes":[{"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","pos":[0,35]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[126,161],"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","linkify":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","nodes":[{"content":"Message Security with Issued Tokens","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"The issued token client enables the federated security scenario in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).","pos":[162,268]},{"content":"Federated security enables the establishment of trust between independent domains.","pos":[275,357]},{"content":"Each domain centralizes authentication and authorization in a security token service.","pos":[358,443]},{"content":"When trust is established between two such services, members of each domain can use the services of the other.","pos":[444,554]},{"pos":[561,733],"content":"For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Federation and Issued Tokens<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)</ept>.","source":"For a detailed explanation about the federated scenario, see [Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)."},{"pos":[742,750],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[754,864],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Federation and Issued Tokens<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)</ept>","source":"[Federation and Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation-and-issued-tokens.md)"},{"pos":[867,973],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric<ept id=\"p1\">](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&amp;clcid=0x409)</ept>","source":"[Security Model for Windows Server App Fabric](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201279&clcid=0x409)"}]}
