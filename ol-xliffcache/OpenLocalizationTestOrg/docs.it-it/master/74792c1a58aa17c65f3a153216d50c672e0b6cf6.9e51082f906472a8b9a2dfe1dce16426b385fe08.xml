By using projection, you can construct a new type that is built from each object. You can project a property and perform a mathematical function on it. You can also project the original object without changing it.  \n  \n The standard query operator methods that perform projection are listed in the following section.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method Name|Description|C# Query Expression Syntax|More Information|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|  \n|Select|Projects values that are based on a transform function.|`select`|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Select%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.Select%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n|SelectMany|Projects sequences of values that are based on a transform function and then flattens them into one sequence.|Use multiple `from` clauses|<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.SelectMany%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType><br /><br /> <xref:System.Linq.Queryable.SelectMany%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>|  \n  \n## Query Expression Syntax Examples  \n  \n### Select  \n The following example uses the `select` clause to project the first letter from each string in a list of strings.  \n  \n```csharp  \nList<string> words = new List<string>() { \"an\", \"apple\", \"a\", \"day\" };  \n  \nvar query = from word in words  \n            select word.Substring(0, 1);  \n  \nforeach (string s in query)  \n    Console.WriteLine(s);  \n  \n/* This code produces the following output:  \n  \n    a  \n    a  \n    a  \n    d  \n*/  \n```  \n  \n### SelectMany  \n The following example uses multiple `from` clauses  to project each word from each string in a list of strings.  \n  \n```csharp  \nList<string> phrases = new List<string>() { \"an apple a day\", \"the quick brown fox\" };  \n  \nvar query = from phrase in phrases  \n            from word in phrase.Split(' ')  \n            select word;  \n  \nforeach (string s in query)  \n    Console.WriteLine(s);  \n  \n/* This code produces the following output:  \n  \n    an  \n    apple  \n    a  \n    day  \n    the  \n    quick  \n    brown  \n    fox  \n*/  \n```  \n  \n## Select versus SelectMany  \n The work of both `Select()` and `SelectMany()` is to produce a result value (or values) from source values. `Select()` produces one result value for every source value. The overall result is therefore a collection that has the same number of elements as the source collection. In contrast, `SelectMany()` produces a single overall result that contains concatenated sub-collections from each source value. The transform function that is passed as an argument to `SelectMany()` must return an enumerable sequence of values for each source value. These enumerable sequences are then concatenated by `SelectMany()` to create one large sequence.  \n  \n The following two illustrations show the conceptual difference between the actions of these two methods. In each case, assume that the selector (transform) function selects the array of flowers from each source value.  \n  \n This illustration depicts how `Select()` returns a collection that has the same number of elements as the source collection.  \n  \n ![Graphic that shows the action of Select&#40;&#41;](./media/projection-operations/select-action-graphic.png)  \n  \n This illustration depicts how `SelectMany()` concatenates the intermediate sequence of arrays into one final result value that contains each value from each intermediate array.  \n  \n ![Graphic showing the action of SelectMany&#40;&#41;.](./media/projection-operations/select-many-action-graphic.png )  \n  \n### Code Example  \n The following example compares the behavior of `Select()` and `SelectMany()`. The code creates a \"bouquet\" of flowers by taking the first two items from each list of flower names in the source collection. In this example, the \"single value\" that the transform function <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Select%60%602%28System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable%7B%60%600%7D%2CSystem.Func%7B%60%600%2C%60%601%7D%29> uses is itself a collection of values. This requires the extra `foreach` loop in order to enumerate each string in each sub-sequence.  \n  \n```csharp  \nclass Bouquet  \n{  \n    public List<string> Flowers { get; set; }  \n}  \n  \nstatic void SelectVsSelectMany()  \n{  \n    List<Bouquet> bouquets = new List<Bouquet>() {  \n        new Bouquet { Flowers = new List<string> { \"sunflower\", \"daisy\", \"daffodil\", \"larkspur\" }},  \n        new Bouquet{ Flowers = new List<string> { \"tulip\", \"rose\", \"orchid\" }},  \n        new Bouquet{ Flowers = new List<string> { \"gladiolis\", \"lily\", \"snapdragon\", \"aster\", \"protea\" }},  \n        new Bouquet{ Flowers = new List<string> { \"larkspur\", \"lilac\", \"iris\", \"dahlia\" }}  \n    };  \n  \n    // *********** Select ***********              \n    IEnumerable<List<string>> query1 = bouquets.Select(bq => bq.Flowers);  \n  \n    // ********* SelectMany *********  \n    IEnumerable<string> query2 = bouquets.SelectMany(bq => bq.Flowers);  \n  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Results by using Select():\");  \n    // Note the extra foreach loop here.  \n    foreach (IEnumerable<String> collection in query1)  \n        foreach (string item in collection)  \n            Console.WriteLine(item);  \n  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"\\nResults by using SelectMany():\");  \n    foreach (string item in query2)  \n        Console.WriteLine(item);  \n  \n    /* This code produces the following output:  \n  \n       Results by using Select():  \n        sunflower  \n        daisy  \n        daffodil  \n        larkspur  \n        tulip  \n        rose  \n        orchid  \n        gladiolis  \n        lily  \n        snapdragon  \n        aster  \n        protea  \n        larkspur  \n        lilac  \n        iris  \n        dahlia  \n  \n       Results by
