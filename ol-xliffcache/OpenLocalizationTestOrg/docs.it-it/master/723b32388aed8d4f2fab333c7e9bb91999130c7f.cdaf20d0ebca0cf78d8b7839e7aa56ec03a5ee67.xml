By default, the display value for a <xref:System.DBNull> cell value is the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle.NullValue%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCellStyle> in effect for the current cell.|  \n  \n### Selection Keys  \n If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> property is set to `false` and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, changing the current cell by using the navigation keys changes the selection to the new cell.

The SHIFT, CTRL, and ALT keys do not affect this behavior.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> is set to `true`, the navigation behavior does not change, but navigating with the keyboard while pressing SHIFT (including CTRL+SHIFT) will modify a multi-cell selection. Before navigation begins, the control marks the current cell as an anchor cell. When you navigate while pressing SHIFT, the selection includes all cells between the anchor cell and the current cell. Other cells in the control will remain selected if they were already selected, but they may become unselected if the keyboard navigation temporarily puts them between the anchor cell and the current cell.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> is set to `true` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, the behavior of the anchor cell and current cell is the same, but only full rows or columns become selected or unselected.  \n  \n## Default Mouse Handling  \n  \n### Basic Mouse Handling  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Clicking a cell with the left mouse button always changes the current cell. Clicking a cell with the right mouse button opens a shortcut menu, when one is available.  \n  \n|Mouse action|Description|  \n|------------------|-----------------|  \n|Left mouse button down|Makes the clicked cell the current cell, and raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellMouseDown?displayProperty=fullName> event.|  \n|Left mouse button up|Raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellMouseUp?displayProperty=fullName> event|  \n|Left mouse button click|Raises the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellClick?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CellMouseClick?displayProperty=fullName> events|  \n|Left mouse button down, and drag on a column header cell|If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.AllowUserToOrderColumns%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property is `true`, moves the column so that it can be dropped into a new position.|  \n  \n### Mouse Selection  \n No selection behavior is associated with the middle mouse button or the mouse wheel.  \n  \n If the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> property is set to `false` and the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> property is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, the following behavior occurs.  \n  \n|Mouse action|Description|  \n|------------------|-----------------|  \n|Click left mouse button|Selects only the current cell if the user clicks a cell. No selection behavior if the user clicks a row or column header.|  \n|Click right mouse button|Displays a shortcut menu if one is available.|  \n  \n The same behavior occurs when the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, except that, depending on the selection mode, clicking a row or column header will select the full row or column and set the current cell to the first cell in the row or column.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, clicking any cell in a row or column will select the full row or column.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> is set to `true`, clicking a cell while pressing CTRL or SHIFT will modify a multi-cell selection.  \n  \n When you click a cell while pressing CTRL, the cell will change its selection state while all other cells retain their current selection state.  \n  \n When you click a cell or a series of cells while pressing SHIFT, the selection includes all cells between the current cell and an anchor cell located at the position of the current cell before the first click. When you click and drag the pointer across multiple cells, the anchor cell is the cell clicked at the beginning of the drag operation. Subsequent clicks while pressing SHIFT change the current cell, but not the anchor cell. Other cells in the control will remain selected if they were already selected, but they may become unselected if mouse navigation temporarily puts them between the anchor cell and the current cell.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> is set to `true` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, clicking a row or column header (depending on the selection mode) while pressing SHIFT will modify an existing selection of full rows or columns if such a selection exists. Otherwise, it will clear the selection and start a new selection of full rows or columns. Clicking a row or column header while pressing CTRL, however, will add or remove the clicked row or column from the current selection without otherwise modifying the current selection.  \n  \n If <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.MultiSelect%2A> is set to `true` and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.SelectionMode%2A> is set to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewSelectionMode>, clicking a cell while pressing SHIFT or CTRL behaves the same way except that only full rows and columns are affected.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView>   \n [DataGridView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/datagridview-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,829],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"data grids, mouse handling\"\n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], navigation keys\"\n  - \"keyboards, default handling in DataGridView control\"\n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], keyboard handling\"\n  - \"mouse, default handling in DataGridView control\"\n  - \"DataGridView control [Windows Forms], mouse handling\"\n  - \"navigation keys, DataGridView control\"\nms.assetid: 4519b928-bfc8-4e8b-bb9c-b1e76a0ca552\ncaps.latest.revision: 19\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,94],"content":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,94]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[836,913],"content":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","linkify":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","nodes":[{"content":"Default Keyboard and Mouse Handling in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control","pos":[0,77]}]},{"pos":[914,1056],"content":"The following tables describe how users can interact with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView&gt;</ph> control through a keyboard and a mouse.","source":"The following tables describe how users can interact with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control through a keyboard and a mouse."},{"pos":[1064,1799],"content":"[!NOTE]\n To customize keyboard behavior, you can handle standard keyboard events such as <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.KeyDown>.
