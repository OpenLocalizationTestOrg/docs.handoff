In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages. SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive. Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,107],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Endpoint: Calls Faulted\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 271e6284-9c4b-465f-b619-069e1555a5e4","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"pos":[0,23],"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","pos":[0,23]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[114,137],"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","linkify":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint: Calls Faulted","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"Counter Name: Calls Faulted.","pos":[138,166]},{"pos":[175,186],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Number of calls to this endpoint that have returned faults.","pos":[190,249]},{"content":"In Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) applications, service methods communicate processing error information using SOAP fault messages.","pos":[250,389]},{"content":"SOAP faults are message types that are included in the metadata for a service operation and therefore create a fault contract that clients can use to make their execution more robust or interactive.","pos":[390,588]},{"content":"Since SOAP faults are expressed to clients in XML form, they are highly interoperable.","pos":[589,675]},{"pos":[684,692],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[696,849],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Specifying and Handling Faults in Contracts and Services](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/specifying-and-handling-faults-in-contracts-and-services.md)"}]}
