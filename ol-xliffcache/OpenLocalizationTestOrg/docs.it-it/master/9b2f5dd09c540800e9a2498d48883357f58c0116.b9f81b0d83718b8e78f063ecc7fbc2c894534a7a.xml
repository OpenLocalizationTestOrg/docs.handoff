Each `Student` object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations.  \n  \nThis application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same `students` data source.  \n  \n## Example\n\nThe following query returns the students who received a score of 90 or greater on their first exam.  \n  \n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#15](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-query-a-collection-of-objects_1.cs)]  \n  \nThis query is intentionally simple to enable you to experiment. For example, you can try more conditions in the `where` clause, or use an `orderby` clause to sort the results.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)\n- [String interpolation](../language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,181],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Query a collection of objects (LINQ in C#)\ndescription: Learn how query collections using LINQ in C#.\nms.date: 11/30/2016\nms.assetid: 87a76f8a-0b58-4791-90ea-2fe0a30416c9","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects (LINQ in C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,42],"content":"Query a collection of objects (LINQ in C#)","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects (LINQ in C#)","pos":[0,42]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"Learn how query collections using LINQ in C#.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"Learn how query collections using LINQ in C#.","nodes":[{"content":"Learn how query collections using LINQ in C#.","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[188,217],"content":"Query a collection of objects","linkify":"Query a collection of objects","nodes":[{"content":"Query a collection of objects","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to perform a simple query over a list of <ph id=\"ph1\">`Student`</ph> objects.","pos":[219,301],"source":"This example shows how to perform a simple query over a list of `Student` objects."},{"content":"Each <ph id=\"ph1\">`Student`</ph> object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations.","pos":[302,444],"source":" Each `Student` object contains some basic information about the student, and a list that represents the student's scores on four examinations."},{"pos":[450,572],"content":"This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same <ph id=\"ph1\">`students`</ph> data source.","source":"This application serves as the framework for many other examples in this section that use the same `students` data source."},{"pos":[581,588],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following query returns the students who received a score of 90 or greater on their first exam.","pos":[590,689]},{"content":"This query is intentionally simple to enable you to experiment.","pos":[818,881]},{"content":"For example, you can try more conditions in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`where`</ph> clause, or use an <ph id=\"ph2\">`orderby`</ph> clause to sort the results.","pos":[882,993],"source":" For example, you can try more conditions in the `where` clause, or use an `orderby` clause to sort the results."},{"pos":[1002,1010],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1014,1058],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language Integrated Query (LINQ)<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)"},{"pos":[1061,1129],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>String interpolation<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md)</ept>","source":"[String interpolation](../language-reference/tokens/interpolated.md)"}]}
