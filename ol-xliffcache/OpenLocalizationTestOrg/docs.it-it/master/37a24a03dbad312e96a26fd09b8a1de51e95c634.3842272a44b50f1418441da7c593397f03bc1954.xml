This creates and opens the listener for the service. Hosting a service in this way is often referred to as \"self-hosting\" because the managed application is doing the hosting work itself. To close the service, call <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.CommunicationObject.Close%2A?displayProperty=fullName> on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost>.  \n  \n A service can also be hosted in a managed Windows service, in Internet Information Services (IIS), or in Windows Process Activation Service (WAS). [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] hosting options for a service, see [Hosting Services](../../../docs/framework/wcf/hosting-services.md).  \n  \n Hosting a service in a managed application is the most flexible option because it requires the least infrastructure to deploy. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] hosting services in managed applications, see [Hosting in a Managed Application](../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/hosting-in-a-managed-application.md).  \n  \n The following procedure demonstrates how to implement a self-hosted service in a console application.  \n  \n### To create a self-hosted service  \n  \n1.  Open [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] and select **New**, **Project...** from the **File** menu.  \n  \n2.  In the **Installed Templates** list, select **Visual C#**, **Windows** or **Visual Basic**, **Windows**. Depending on your [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] settings, one or both of these may be under the **Other Languages** node in the **Installed Templates** list.  \n  \n3.  Select **Console Application** from the **Windows** list. Type `SelfHost` in the **Name** box and click **OK**.  \n  \n4.  Right-click **SelfHost** in **Solution Explorer** and select **Add Reference...**. Select **System.ServiceModel** from the **.NET** tab and click **OK**.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  If the **Solution Explorer** window is not visible, select **Solution Explorer** from the **View** menu.  \n  \n5.  Double-click **Program.cs** or **Module1.vb** in **Solution Explorer** to open it in the code window if it is not already open. Add the following statements at the top of the file.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_SelfHost4#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_selfhost4/cs/program.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_SelfHost4#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_selfhost4/vb/module1.vb#1)]  \n  \n6.

Enable metadata publishing, and then call the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open%2A> method on the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> to initialize the service and prepare it to receive messages.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[CFX_SelfHost4#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_selfhost4/cs/program.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[CFX_SelfHost4#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/cfx_selfhost4/vb/module1.vb#4)]       \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  This example uses default endpoints, and no configuration file is required for this service.

Press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build the solution.  \n  \n### To test the service  \n  \n1.  Press Ctrl + F5 to run the service.  \n  \n2.  Open **WCF Test Client**.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  To open **WCF Test Client**, open a [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)] command prompt and execute **WcfTestClient.exe**.  \n  \n3.  Select **Add Service...** from the **File** menu.  \n  \n4.  Type `http://localhost:8080/hello` into the address box and click **OK**.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  Make sure the service is running or else this step fails. If you have changed the base address in the code, then use the modified base address in this step.  \n  \n5.  Double-click **SayHello** under the **My Service Projects** node. Type your name into the **Value** column in the **Request** list, and click **Invoke**. A reply message appears in the **Response** list.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example creates a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object to host a service of type `HelloWorldService`, and then calls the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ICommunicationObject.Open%2A> method on <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost>.
