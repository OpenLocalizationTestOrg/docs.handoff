It can be used in conjunction with the [PrintDialog](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-windows-forms.md) component to be in control of all aspects of document printing.  \n  \n## Working with the PrintDocument Component  \n Two of the main scenarios that involve the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component are:  \n  \n-   Simple print jobs, such as printing an individual text file. In such a case you would add the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component to a Windows Form, then add programming logic that prints a file in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event handler. The programming logic should culminate with the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.Print%2A> method to print the document. This method sends a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object, contained in the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs.Graphics%2A> property of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs> class, to the printer. For an example that shows how to print a text document using the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component, see [How to: Print a Multi-Page Text File in Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-print-a-multi-page-text-file-in-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n-   More complex print jobs, such as a situation where you will want to reuse printing logic you have written. In such a case you would derive a new component from the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component and override (see [Overrides](~/docs/visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md) for Visual Basic or [override](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override.md) for C#) the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event.  \n  \n When it is added to a form, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument> component appears in the tray at the bottom of the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>   \n [Windows Forms Print
