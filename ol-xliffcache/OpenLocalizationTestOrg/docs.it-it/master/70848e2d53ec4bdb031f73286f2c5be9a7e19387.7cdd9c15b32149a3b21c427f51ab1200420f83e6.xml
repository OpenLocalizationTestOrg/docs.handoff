Parsing a text file with `TextFieldParser` is similar to iterating over a text file, while the parse method to extract fields of text is similar to string manipulation methods used to tokenize delimited strings.  \n  \n## Parsing different types of text files  \n Text files may have fields of various width, delimited by a character such as a comma or a tab space. Define `TextFieldType` and the delimiter, as in the following example, which uses the `SetDelimiters` method to define a tab-delimited text file:  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrTextFieldParser#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrTextFieldParser/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n  \n Other text files may have field widths that are fixed. In such cases, you need to define the `TextFieldType` as `FixedWidth` and define the widths of each field, as in the following example. This example uses the `SetFieldWidths` method to define the columns of text: the first column is 5 characters wide, the second is 10, the third is 11, and the fourth is of variable width.  \n  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrTextFieldParser#22](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrTextFieldParser/VB/Class1.vb#22)]  \n  \n Once the format is defined, you can loop through the file, using the `ReadFields` method to process each line in turn.  \n  \n If a field does not match the specified format, a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.MalformedLineException> exception is thrown. When such exceptions are thrown, the `ErrorLine` and `ErrorLineNumber` properties hold the text causing the exception and the line number of that text.  \n  \n## Parsing files with multiple formats  \n The `PeekChars` method of the `TextFieldParser` object can be used to check each field before reading it, allowing you to define multiple formats for the fields and react accordingly. For more information, see [How to: Read From Text Files with Multiple Formats](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/how-to-read-from-text-files-with-multiple-formats.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
