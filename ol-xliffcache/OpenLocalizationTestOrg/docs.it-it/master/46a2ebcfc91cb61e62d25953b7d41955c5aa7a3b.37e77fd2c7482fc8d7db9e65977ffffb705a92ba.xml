If you set an object variable to `Nothing` frequently, or if it is possible the variable is not initialized, it is a good idea to enclose member accesses in a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n If you use an object variable for objects that contain confidential or sensitive data, you can set the variable to `Nothing` when you are not actively dealing with one of those objects. This reduces the chance of malicious code gaining access to the data.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.NullReferenceException>   \n [Object Variables](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variables.md)   \n [Object Variable Assignment](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variable-assignment.md)   \n [Nothing](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md)   \n [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md)   \n [Troubleshooting Exceptions: System.NullReferenceException](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/4822b0b4-8105-43fb-887a-3cc51ff02899)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,687],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make an Object Variable Not Refer to Any Instance (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,89],"content":"How to: Make an Object Variable Not Refer to Any Instance (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Make an Object Variable Not Refer to Any Instance (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,89]}]}],"pos":[6,98],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Make an Object Variable Not Refer to Any Instance (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
