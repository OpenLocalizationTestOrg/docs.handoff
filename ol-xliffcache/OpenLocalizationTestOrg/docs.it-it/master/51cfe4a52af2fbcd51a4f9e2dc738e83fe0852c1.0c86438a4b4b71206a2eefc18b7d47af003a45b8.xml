Container file that contains the key. Enclose the file name in quotation marks (\"\") if the name contains a space.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The compiler creates the sharable component by inserting a public key into the assembly manifest and by signing the final assembly with the private key. To generate a key file, type `sn -k file` at the command line. The `-i` option installs the key pair into a container. For more information, see [Sn.exe (Strong Name Tool)](../../../framework/tools/sn-exe-strong-name-tool.md)).  \n  \n If you compile with `-target:module`, the name of the key file is held in the module and incorporated into the assembly that is created when you compile an assembly with [-addmodule](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/addmodule.md).  \n  \n You can also specify this option as a custom attribute (<xref:System.Reflection.AssemblyKeyNameAttribute>) in the source code for any Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) module.  \n  \n You can also pass your encryption information to the compiler with [-keyfile](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/keyfile.md). Use [-delaysign](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/delaysign.md) if you want a partially signed assembly.  \n  \n See [Creating and Using Strong-Named Assemblies](../../../framework/app-domains/create-and-use-strong-named-assemblies.md) for more information on signing an assembly.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-keycontainer` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles source file `Input.vb` and specifies a key container.  \n  \n```  \nvbc -keycontainer:key1 input.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Assemblies in .NET](../../../standard/assembly/index.md)\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line
