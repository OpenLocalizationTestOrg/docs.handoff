Both `Integer` and `UInteger` have standard widening conversions to `Double`, which makes conversion to `Double` the best choice. Type inference assigns to loop control variable `i` the data type `Double`.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim stepVar As Double = 1  \n' Valid.  \nFor i = m To n Step stepVar  \n    ' Loop processing.  \nNext  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30983  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Explicitly convert one of the variables to a type that the others have a widening conversion to, for example:  \n  \n    ```  \n    For i = m To CLng(n)  \n    ```  \n  \n-   Use an `As` clause to specify the type of the control variable:  \n  \n    ```  \n    For i As Double = m To n   \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n
