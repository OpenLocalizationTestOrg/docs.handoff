Note that the ordering is performed after the join. Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it. Some LINQ providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.\n\n## Example\n\nThis query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope. Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.\n\n[!code-csharp[csProgGuideLINQ#81](~/samples/snippets/csharp/concepts/linq/how-to-order-the-results-of-a-join-clause_1.cs)]\n\n## See also\n\n- [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)\n- [orderby clause](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md)\n- [join clause](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,200],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Order the results of a join clause (LINQ in C#)\ndescription: Learn how to order the results of a LINQ join clause in C#.\nms.date: 12/01/2016\nms.assetid: a7458901-1201-4c25-b8d9-c04ca52e0eb9","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause (LINQ in C#)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"Order the results of a join clause (LINQ in C#)","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause (LINQ in C#)","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"Learn how to order the results of a LINQ join clause in C#.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,59],"content":"Learn how to order the results of a LINQ join clause in C#.","nodes":[{"content":"Learn how to order the results of a LINQ join clause in C#.","pos":[0,59]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[207,241],"content":"Order the results of a join clause","linkify":"Order the results of a join clause","nodes":[{"content":"Order the results of a join clause","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"This example shows how to order the results of a join operation.","pos":[243,307]},{"content":"Note that the ordering is performed after the join.","pos":[308,359]},{"content":"Although you can use an <ph id=\"ph1\">`orderby`</ph> clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it.","pos":[360,492],"source":" Although you can use an `orderby` clause with one or more of the source sequences before the join, generally we do not recommend it."},{"content":"Some LINQ providers might not preserve that ordering after the join.","pos":[493,561]},{"pos":[566,573],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"This query creates a group join, and then sorts the groups based on the category element, which is still in scope.","pos":[575,689]},{"content":"Inside the anonymous type initializer, a sub-query orders all the matching elements from the products sequence.","pos":[690,801]},{"pos":[930,938],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[942,986],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language Integrated Query (LINQ)<ept id=\"p1\">](index.md)</ept>","source":"[Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](index.md)"},{"pos":[989,1055],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>orderby clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md)</ept>","source":"[orderby clause](../language-reference/keywords/orderby-clause.md)"},{"pos":[1058,1118],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>join clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md)</ept>","source":"[join clause](../language-reference/keywords/join-clause.md)"}]}
