For example:  \n  \n She said, \"You deserve a treat!\"  \n  \n As an alternative, you can also use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ControlChars.Quote> field as a constant.  \n  \n### To place quotation marks in a string in your code  \n  \n1.  In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], insert two quotation marks in a row as an embedded quotation mark. In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)], insert the escape sequence \\\\\" as an embedded quotation mark. For example, to create the preceding string, use the following code.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub InsertQuote()  \n       TextBox1.Text = \"She said, \"\"You deserve a treat!\"\" \"  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void InsertQuote(){  \n       textBox1.Text = \"She said, \\\"You deserve a treat!\\\" \";  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void InsertQuote()  \n       {  \n          textBox1->Text = \"She said, \\\"You deserve a treat!\\\" \";  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n2.  Insert the ASCII or Unicode character for a quotation mark. In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], use the ASCII character (34). In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], use the Unicode character (\\u0022).  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub InsertAscii()  \n       TextBox1.Text = \"She said, \" & Chr(34) & \"You deserve a treat!\" & Chr(34)  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void InsertAscii(){  \n       textBox1.Text = \"She said, \" + '\\u0022' + \"You deserve a treat!\" + '\\u0022';  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  In this example, you cannot use \\u0022 because you cannot use a universal character name that designates a character in the basic character set. Otherwise, you produce C3851. For more information, see [Compiler Error C3851](/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c3851).  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n3.  You can also define a constant for the character, and use it where needed.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Const quote As String = \"\"\"\"  \n    TextBox1.Text = \"She said, \" & quote & \"You deserve a treat!\" & quote  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    const string quote = \"\\\"\";  \n    textBox1.Text = \"She said, \" + quote +  \"You deserve a treat!\"+ quote ;  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    const String^ quote = \"\\\"\";  \n    textBox1->Text = String::Concat(\"She said, \",  \n       const_cast<String^>(quote), \"You deserve a treat!\",  \n       const_cast<String^>(quote));  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>   \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ControlChars.Quote>   \n [TextBox Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/textbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Control the Insertion Point in a Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-control-the-insertion-point-in-a-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: Create a Password Text Box with the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-password-text-box-with-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: Create a Read-Only Text Box](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-create-a-read-only-text-box-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Select Text in the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-select-text-in-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [How to: View Multiple Lines in the Windows Forms TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-view-multiple-lines-in-the-windows-forms-textbox-control.md)   \n [TextBox Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/textbox-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,84],"content":"How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,72]}]},{"pos":[587,642],"content":"How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms)","linkify":"How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Put Quotation Marks in a String (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"Sometimes you might want to place quotation marks (\" \") in a string of text.","pos":[643,719]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[720,732]},{"content":"She said, \"You deserve a treat!\"","pos":[739,771]},{"content":"As an alternative, you can also use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ControlChars.Quote&gt;</ph> field as a constant.","pos":[778,886],"source":"As an alternative, you can also use the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ControlChars.Quote> field as a constant."},{"pos":[896,945],"content":"To place quotation marks in a string in your code","linkify":"To place quotation marks in a string in your code","nodes":[{"content":"To place quotation marks in a string in your code","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]</ph>, insert two quotation marks in a row as an embedded quotation mark.","pos":[955,1079],"source":"In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], insert two quotation marks in a row as an embedded quotation mark."},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]</ph>, insert the escape sequence <ph id=\"ph3\">\\\\</ph>\" as an embedded quotation mark.","pos":[1080,1257],"source":" In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)], insert the escape sequence \\\\\" as an embedded quotation mark."},{"content":"For example, to create the preceding string, use the following code.","pos":[1258,1326]},{"content":"-or-","pos":[1771,1775]},{"content":"Insert the ASCII or Unicode character for a quotation mark.","pos":[1785,1844]},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)]</ph>, use the ASCII character (34).","pos":[1845,1932],"source":" In [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)], use the ASCII character (34)."},{"content":"In <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)]</ph>, use the Unicode character (\\u0022).","pos":[1933,2026],"source":" In [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], use the Unicode character (\\u0022)."},{"pos":[2352,2651],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIn this example, you cannot use \\u0022 because you cannot use a universal character name that designates a character in the basic character set.
