They do not affect binaries that target a previous version of the .NET Framework but are running under version 4.6.2. The [!INCLUDE[net_v462](../../../includes/net-v462-md.md)] includes retargeting changes in the following areas:  \n  \n-   [Core](#Core)  \n  \n-   [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)](#WCF)  \n  \n-   [Windows Forms](#WinForms)  \n  \n The Scope column in the following tables specifies the significance of each change:  \n  \n-   Major. A significant change that affects a large number of apps or that requires substantial modification of code. Note that none of the retargeting changes fall into this category.  \n  \n-   Minor. A change that either affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.  \n  \n-   Edge. A change that affects apps under very specific scenarios that are not common.  \n  \n-   Transparent. A change that has no noticeable effect on the app's developer or user.
