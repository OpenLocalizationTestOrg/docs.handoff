The meaning of the [- operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/subtraction-operator.md) is dependent on the types of `x` and `y` (subtraction for numeric operands, delegate removal for delegate operands, and so forth).  \n  \n The `-=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [- operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/subtraction-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  \n  \n The -= operator is also used in C# to unsubscribe from an event.
