For instance, an application UI created in XAML can be conceptualized as an object tree. The element tree can be further divided into two discrete yet sometimes parallel trees: the logical tree and the visual tree. Serialization in WPF involves saving the state of these two trees as well as application state and writing it to a file, potentially as XAML.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Trees in
