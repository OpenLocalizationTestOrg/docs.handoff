You can retrieve setup information from an application domain using the <xref:System.AppDomain?displayProperty=fullName> class. This class provides several members that retrieve configuration information about an application domain.  \n  \n You can also query the **AppDomainSetup** object for the application domain to obtain setup information that was passed to the domain when it was created.  \n  \n The following example creates a new application domain and then prints several member values to the console.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[AppDomain_Setup#2](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AppDomain_Setup/CPP/source2.cpp#2)]\n [!code-csharp[AppDomain_Setup#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/AppDomain_Setup/CS/source2.cs#2)]\n [!code-vb[AppDomain_Setup#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/AppDomain_Setup/VB/source2.vb#2)]  \n  \n The following example sets, and then retrieves, setup information for an application domain.
