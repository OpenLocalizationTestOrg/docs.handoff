This error can occur for several reasons:  \n  \n-   A variable was declared without specifying a type. If a variable is declared without specifying a type, it defaults to type `Object`.  \n  \n     For example, a variable declared with `Dim x` would be of type `Object;` a variable declared with `Dim x As String` would be of type `String`.  \n  \n    > [!TIP]\n    >  The `Option Strict` statement disallows implicit typing that results in an `Object` type. If you omit the type, a compile-time error will occur. See [Option Strict Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/option-strict-statement.md).  \n  \n-   You are attempting to reference an object that has been set to `Nothing`  \n  \n     .  \n  \n-   You are attempting to access an element of an array variable that wasn't properly declared.  \n  \n     For example, an array declared as `products() As String` will trigger the error if you try to reference an element of the array `products(3) = \"Widget\"`. The array has no elements and is treated as an object.  \n  \n-   You are attempting to access code within a `With...End With` block before the block has been initialized.   A `With...End With` block must be initialized by executing the `With` statement entry point.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In earlier versions of Visual Basic or VBA this error was also triggered by assigning a value to a variable without using the `Set` keyword (`x = \"name\"` instead of `Set x = \"name\"`). The `Set` keyword is no longer valid in Visual Basic .Net.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Set `Option Strict` to `On` by adding the following code to the beginning of the file:  \n  \n```vb  \nOption Strict On  \n```  \n\n     When you run the project, a compiler error will appear in the **Error List** for any variable that was specified without a type.  \n  \n2.  If you don't want to enable `Option Strict`, search your code for any variables that were specified without a type (`Dim x` instead of `Dim x As String`) and add the intended type to the declaration.  \n  \n3.  Make sure you aren't referring to  an object variable that has been set to `Nothing`.  Search your code for the keyword `Nothing`, and revise your code so that the object isn't set to `Nothing` until after you have referenced it.  \n  \n4.  Make sure that any array  variables are dimensioned before you access them. You can either assign a dimension when you first create the array (`Dim x(5) As String` instead of `Dim x() As String`), or use the `ReDim` keyword to set the dimensions of the array before you first access it.  \n  \n5.  Make sure your `With` block is initialized by executing the `With` statement entry point.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Object Variable Declaration](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/variables/object-variable-declaration.md)   \n [ReDim Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/redim-statement.md)   \n [With...End With Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/with-end-with-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,581],"nodes":[{"content":"Object variable or With block variable not set | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,63],"content":"Object variable or With block variable not set | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"Object variable or With block variable not set | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,63]}]}],"pos":[6,72],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"Object variable or With block variable not set | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"devlang-visual-basic\"\n\nms.topic: \"article\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID91\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"VB\"\nms.assetid: 2f03e611-f0ed-465c-99a2-a816e034faa3\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\n\ntranslation.priority.ht: \n  - \"de-de\"\n  - \"es-es\"\n  - \"fr-fr\"\n  - \"it-it\"\n  - \"ja-jp\"\n  - \"ko-kr\"\n  - \"ru-ru\"\n  - \"zh-cn\"\n  - \"zh-tw\"\ntranslation.priority.mt: \n  - \"cs-cz\"\n  - \"pl-pl\"\n  - \"pt-br\"\n  - \"tr-tr\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[588,634],"content":"Object variable or With block variable not set","linkify":"Object variable or With block variable not set","nodes":[{"content":"Object variable or With block variable not set","pos":[0,46]}]},{"content":"An invalid object variable is being referenced.","pos":[635,682]},{"content":"This error can occur for several reasons:","pos":[685,726]},{"content":"A variable was declared without specifying a type.","pos":[736,786]},{"content":"If a variable is declared without specifying a type, it defaults to type <ph id=\"ph1\">`Object`</ph>.","pos":[787,869],"source":" If a variable is declared without specifying a type, it defaults to type `Object`."},{"pos":[880,1022],"content":"For example, a variable declared with <ph id=\"ph1\">`Dim x`</ph> would be of type <ph id=\"ph2\">`Object;`</ph> a variable declared with <ph id=\"ph3\">`Dim x As String`</ph> would be of type <ph id=\"ph4\">`String`</ph>.","source":"For example, a variable declared with `Dim x` would be of type `Object;` a variable declared with `Dim x As String` would be of type `String`."},{"pos":[1034,1303],"content":"[!TIP]\nThe `Option Strict` statement disallows implicit typing that results in an `Object` type.
