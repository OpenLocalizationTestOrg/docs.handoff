The [fixed](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/fixed-statement.md) statement is used to declare pointers to the source and destination arrays. This *pins* the location of the source and destination arrays in memory so that they will not be moved by garbage collection. The memory blocks for the arrays are unpinned when the `fixed` block is completed. Because the `Copy` method in this example uses the `unsafe` keyword, it must be compiled with the **/unsafe** compiler option. To set the option in Visual Studio, right-click the project name, and then click **Properties**. On the **Build** tab, select **Allow unsafe code**.  \n  \n## Example  \n
