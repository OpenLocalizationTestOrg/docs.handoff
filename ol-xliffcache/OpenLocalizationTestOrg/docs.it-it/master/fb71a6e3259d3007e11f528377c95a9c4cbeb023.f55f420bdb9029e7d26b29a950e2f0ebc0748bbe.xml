You may also need to change the current cell. You can perform these tasks with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CurrentCell%2A> property.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  You cannot set the current cell in a row or column that has its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewBand.Visible%2A> property set to `false`.  \n  \n Depending on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's selection mode, changing the current cell can change the selection. For more information, see [Selection Modes in the Windows Forms DataGridView Control](selection-modes-in-the-windows-forms-datagridview-control.md).  \n  \n### To get the current cell programmatically  \n  \n-   Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CurrentCell%2A> property.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#080](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/CS/datagridviewmisc.cs#080)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc#080](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewMisc/VB/datagridviewmisc.vb#080)]  \n  \n### To set the current cell programmatically  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView.CurrentCell%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control.
