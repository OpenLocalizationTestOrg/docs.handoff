Since the assembly is not declaring itself CLS compliant, there is no need for anything within the assembly to declare itself non-compliant, since it is assumed to be non-compliant. For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md).\n  \n To get rid of this warning, remove the attribute or add the assembly level attribute.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example generates CS3021:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS3021.cs  \nusing System;  \n// Uncomment the following line to declare the assembly CLS Compliant,  \n// and avoid the warning without removing the attribute on the class.  \n//[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]  \n  \n// Remove the next line to avoid the warning.  \n[CLSCompliant(false)]               // CS3021  \npublic class C  \n{  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../docs/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS3021\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS3021\"\nms.assetid: 89f09e4d-65b0-4422-86ea-85c7e05ac29b","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS3021","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"'type' does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute","pos":[218,323]},{"content":"This warning occurs if <ph id=\"ph1\">`[CLSCompliant(false)]`</ph> appears on a class in an assembly which does not have an assembly-level CLSCompliant attribute set to true (that is, the line <ph id=\"ph2\">`[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]`</ph>).","pos":[330,537],"source":"This warning occurs if `[CLSCompliant(false)]` appears on a class in an assembly which does not have an assembly-level CLSCompliant attribute set to true (that is, the line `[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]`)."},{"content":"Since the assembly is not declaring itself CLS compliant, there is no need for anything within the assembly to declare itself non-compliant, since it is assumed to be non-compliant.","pos":[538,719]},{"content":"For more information on CLS compliance, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language independence and language-independent components<ept id=\"p1\">](../../standard/language-independence.md)</ept>.","pos":[720,865],"source":" For more information on CLS compliance, see [Language independence and language-independent components](../../standard/language-independence.md)."},{"content":"To get rid of this warning, remove the attribute or add the assembly level attribute.","pos":[870,955]},{"pos":[964,971],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example generates CS3021:","pos":[975,1014]},{"pos":[1427,1435],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1439,1583],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Language Independence and Language-Independent Components<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md)</ept>","source":"[Language Independence and Language-Independent Components](../../../docs/standard/language-independence-and-language-independent-components.md)"}]}
