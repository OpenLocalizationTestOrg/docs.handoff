With one exception, all the bindings have a default security scheme enabled. This topic helps you select the right binding for your security needs.  \n  \n For an overview of WCF security, see [Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-overview.md). For more information about programming WCF using bindings, see [Programming WCF Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/programming-wcf-security.md).  \n  \n If you have already selected a binding, you can find out more about the run-time behaviors that are associated with security in [Security Behaviors](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-behaviors-in-wcf.md).  \n  \n Some security functions are not programmable using the system-provided bindings. For more control using a custom binding, see [Security Capabilities with Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-capabilities-with-custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n## Security Functions of Bindings  \n WCF includes a number of system-provided bindings that meet most needs. If a particular binding does not suffice, you can also create a custom binding. For a list of system-provided bindings, see [System-Provided Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/system-provided-bindings.md). For more information about custom bindings, see [Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n Every binding in WCF has two forms: as an API and as an XML element used in a configuration file. For example, the `WSHttpBinding` (API) has a counterpart in the [\\<wsHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md).  \n  \n The following section lists both forms for each binding and summarizes the security features.  \n  \n### BasicHttp  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<basicHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/basichttpbinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is designed for use with a range of existing technologies, including the following:  \n  \n-   ASP.NET Web services (ASMX), version 1.  \n  \n-   Web Service Enhancements (WSE) applications.  \n  \n-   Basic Profile as defined in the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) specification ([https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=38955](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=38955)).  \n  \n-   Basic security profile as defined in WS-I.  \n  \n By default, this binding is not secure. It is designed to interoperate with ASMX services. When security is enabled, the binding is designed for seamless interoperation with Internet Information Services (IIS) security mechanisms, such as basic authentication, digest, and integrated Windows security. For more information, see [Transport Security Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-overview.md). This binding supports the following:  \n  \n-   HTTPS transport security.  \n  \n-   HTTP basic authentication.  \n  \n-   WS-Security.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpMessageSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpMessageCredentialType>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpSecurityMode>.  \n  \n### WSHttpBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<wsHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wshttpbinding.md).  \n  \n By default, this binding implements the WS-Security specification and provides interoperability with services that implement the WS-* specifications. It supports the following:  \n  \n-   HTTPS transport security.  \n  \n-   WS-Security.  \n  \n-   HTTPS transport protection with SOAP message credential security for authenticating the caller.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSHttpSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageSecurityOverHttp>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageCredentialType>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.SecurityMode>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpTransportSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpClientCredentialType>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.HttpProxyCredentialType>.  \n  \n### WSDualHttpBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<wsDualHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wsdualhttpbinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is designed to enable duplex service applications. This binding implements the WS-Security specification for message-based transfer security. Transport security is not available. By default, it provides the following features:  \n  \n-   Implements WS-Reliable Messaging for reliability.  \n  \n-   Implements WS-Security for transfer security and authentication.  \n  \n-   Uses HTTP for message delivery.  \n  \n-   Uses text/XML message encoding.  \n  \n Using WS-Security (message-layer security), the binding allows you to configure the following parameters:  \n  \n-   The security algorithm suite to determine the cryptographic algorithm.  \n  \n-   Binding options for the following:  \n  \n    -   Providing service credentials available out-of-band at the client.  \n  \n    -   Providing service credentials negotiated from the service as part of channel setup.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpSecurity> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSDualHttpSecurityMode>.  \n  \n### NetTcpBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<netTcpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/nettcpbinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is optimized for cross-machine communication. By default, it has the following characteristics:  \n  \n-   Implements transport-layer security.  \n  \n-   Leverages Windows security for transfer security and authentication.  \n  \n-   Uses TCP for transport.  \n  \n-   Implements binary message encoding.  \n  \n-   Implements WS-Reliable Messaging.  \n  \n Options include the following:  \n  \n-   Message-layer security (using WS-Security).  \n  \n-   Transport security with message credentialâ€”confidentiality and integrity provided by Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP, and credentials for authorization provided by WS-Security.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.TcpTransportSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.TcpClientCredentialType>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageSecurityOverTcp>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageCredentialType>.  \n  \n### NetNamedPipeBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetNamedPipeBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<netNamedPipeBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/netnamedpipebinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is optimized for cross-process communication (usually on the same machine). By default, this binding has the following characteristics:  \n  \n-   Uses transport security for message transfer and authentication.  \n  \n-   Uses named pipes for message delivery.  \n  \n-   Implements binary message encoding.  \n  \n-   Encryption and message signing.  \n  \n Options include the following:  \n  \n-   Authentication using Windows security.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetNamedPipeSecurity>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetNamedPipeSecurityMode>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.NamedPipeTransportSecurity>.  \n  \n### MsmqIntegrationBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqIntegration.MsmqIntegrationBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<msmqIntegrationBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/msmqintegrationbinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is optimized for creating WCF clients and services that interoperate with non-WCF Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) endpoints.  \n  \n By default, this binding uses transport security and provides the following security characteristics:  \n  \n-   Security can be disabled (None).  \n  \n-   MSMQ transport security (Transport).  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqSecurity> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqSecurityMode>.  \n  \n### NetMsmqBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<netMsmqBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/netmsmqbinding.md).  \n  \n This binding is intended for use when creating WCF services that require MSMQ queued message support.  \n  \n By default, this binding uses transport security and provides the following security characteristics:  \n  \n-   Security can be disabled (None).  \n  \n-   MSMQ transport security (Transport).  \n  \n-   SOAP-based message security (Message).  \n  \n-   Simultaneous Transport and Message security (Both).  \n  \n-   Client Credential Types supported: None, Windows, UserName, Certificate, IssuedToken.  \n  \n The <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageCredentialType.Certificate> credential is supported only when the security mode is set to either <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqSecurityMode.Both> or <xref:System.ServiceModel.NetMsmqSecurityMode.Message>.  \n  \n For more information, see <xref:System.ServiceModel.MessageSecurityOverMsmq> and <xref:System.ServiceModel.MsmqTransportSecurity>.  \n  \n### WSFederationHttpBinding  \n In code, use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpBinding> class; in configuration, use the [\\<wsFederationHttpBinding>](../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/wsfederationhttpbinding.md).  \n  \n By default, this binding uses WS-Security (message-layer security).  \n  \n For more information, see [Federation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/federation.md), <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpSecurity>, and <xref:System.ServiceModel.WSFederationHttpSecurityMode>.  \n  \n## Custom Bindings  \n If none of the system-provided bindings meets you requirements, you can create a custom binding with a custom security binding element. For more information, see [Security Capabilities with Custom Bindings](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-capabilities-with-custom-bindings.md).  \n  \n## Binding Choices  \n The following table summarizes the features offered in the security mode setting, that is, it lists the features available when the security mode is set to `Transport`, `Message`, or `TransportWithMessageCredential`. Use this table to help you find the security features your application requires.  \n  \n|Setting|Features|  \n|-------------|--------------|  \n|Transport|Server authentication<br /><br /> Client authentication<br /><br /> Point-to-point security<br /><br /> Interoperability<br /><br /> Hardware acceleration<br /><br /> High throughput<br /><br /> Secure firewall<br /><br /> High-latency applications<br /><br /> Re-encryption across multiple hops|  \n|Message|Server authentication<br /><br /> Client authentication<br /><br /> End-to-end security<br /><br /> Interoperability<br /><br /> Rich claims<br /><br /> Federation<br /><br /> Multifactor authentication<br /><br /> Custom tokens<br /><br /> Notary/timestamp service<br /><br /> High-latency applications<br /><br /> Persistence of message signatures|  \n|TransportWithMessageCredential|Server authentication<br /><br /> Client authentication<br /><br /> Point-to-point security<br /><br /> Interoperability<br /><br /> Hardware acceleration<br /><br /> High throughput<br /><br /> Rich client claims<br /><br /> Federation<br /><br /> Multifactor authentication<br /><br /> Custom tokens<br /><br /> Secure firewall<br /><br /> High-latency applications<br /><br /> Re-encryption across multiple hops|  \n  \n The following table lists the bindings that support the various mode settings. Select a binding from the table to use to create your service endpoint.  \n  \n|Binding|Transport mode support|Message mode support|TransportWithMessageCredential support|  \n|-------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  \n|`BasicHttpBinding`|Yes|Yes|Yes|  \n|`WSHttpBinding`|Yes|Yes|Yes|  \n|`WSDualHttpBinding`|No|Yes|No|  \n|`NetTcpBinding`|Yes|Yes|Yes|  \n|`NetNamedPipeBinding`|Yes|No|No|  \n|`NetMsmqBinding`|Yes|Yes|No|  \n|`MsmqIntegrationBinding`|Yes|No|No|  \n|`wsFederationHttpBinding`|No|Yes|Yes|  \n  \n## Transport Credentials in Bindings  \n The following table lists the client credential types available when using either `BasicHttpBinding` or `WSHttpBinding` in transport security mode.  \n  \n|Type|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|None|Specifies that the client does not need to present any credential. This translates to an anonymous client.|  \n|Basic|Basic authentication. For more information, see RFC 2617 â€“ HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Authentication, available at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=84023](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=84023).|  \n|Digest|Digest authentication.
