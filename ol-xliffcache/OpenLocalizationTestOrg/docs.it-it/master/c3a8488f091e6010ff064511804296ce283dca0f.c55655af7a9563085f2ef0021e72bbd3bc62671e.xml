For an overview of all six tasks, see the [Getting Started Tutorial](../../../docs/framework/wcf/getting-started-tutorial.md) topic.  \n  \n The next step in creating a WCF application is to implement the service interface. This involves creating a class called `CalculatorService` that implements the user-defined `ICalculator` interface..  \n  \n### To implement a WCF service contract  \n  \n1.  Open the Service1.cs or Service1.vb file and add the following code:  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    //Service1.cs  \n    using System;  \n    using System.Collections.Generic;  \n    using System.Linq;  \n    using System.Runtime.Serialization;
