The list of bindings is ordered from highest priority to lowest priority. If the highest priority binding returns a value successfully when it is processed then there is never a need to process the other bindings in the list. It could be the case that the highest priority binding takes a long time to be evaluated, the next highest priority that returns a value successfully will be used until a binding of a higher priority returns a value successfully.  \n  \n## Example  \n To demonstrate how <xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding> works, the `AsyncDataSource` object has been created with the following three properties: `FastDP`, `SlowerDP`, and `SlowestDP`.  \n  \n The get accessor of `FastDP` returns the value of the `_fastDP` data member.  \n  \n The get accessor of `SlowerDP` waits for 3 seconds before returning the value of the `_slowerDP` data member.  \n  \n The get accessor of `SlowestDP` waits for 5 seconds before returning the value of the `_slowestDP` data member.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This example is for demonstration purposes only. The [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_net](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-net-md.md)] guidelines recommend against defining properties that are orders of magnitude slower than a field set would be.

When this <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> is processed, it does not return a value successfully because it is sleeping for 5 seconds, so the next <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> element is processed. The next <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> does not return a value successfully because it is sleeping for 3 seconds. The binding engine then moves onto the next <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> element, which is bound to the `FastDP` property. This <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding> returns the value \"Fast Value\". The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> now displays the value \"Fast Value\".  \n  \n After 3 seconds elapses, the `SlowerDP` property returns the value \"Slower Value\". The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> then displays the value \"Slower Value\".  \n  \n After 5 seconds elapses, the `SlowestDP` property returns the value \"Slowest Value\". That binding has the highest priority because it is listed first. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock> now displays the value \"Slowest Value\".  \n  \n See <xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding> for information about what is considered a successful return value from a binding.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Data.Binding.IsAsync%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [Data Binding Overview](data-binding-overview.md)\n- [How-to Topics](data-binding-how-to-topics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,221],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Implement PriorityBinding\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"data binding [WPF], PriorityBinding class\"\nms.assetid: d63b65ab-b3e9-4322-9aa8-1450f8d89532","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[228,261],"content":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","linkify":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement PriorityBinding","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding&gt;</ph> in <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)]</ph> works by specifying a list of bindings.","pos":[262,427],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding> in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)] works by specifying a list of bindings."},{"content":"The list of bindings is ordered from highest priority to lowest priority.","pos":[428,501]},{"content":"If the highest priority binding returns a value successfully when it is processed then there is never a need to process the other bindings in the list.","pos":[502,653]},{"content":"It could be the case that the highest priority binding takes a long time to be evaluated, the next highest priority that returns a value successfully will be used until a binding of a higher priority returns a value successfully.","pos":[654,883]},{"pos":[892,899],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[903,1093],"content":"To demonstrate how <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding&gt;</ph> works, the <ph id=\"ph2\">`AsyncDataSource`</ph> object has been created with the following three properties: <ph id=\"ph3\">`FastDP`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph4\">`SlowerDP`</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph5\">`SlowestDP`</ph>.","source":"To demonstrate how <xref:System.Windows.Data.PriorityBinding> works, the `AsyncDataSource` object has been created with the following three properties: `FastDP`, `SlowerDP`, and `SlowestDP`."},{"pos":[1100,1176],"content":"The get accessor of <ph id=\"ph1\">`FastDP`</ph> returns the value of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`_fastDP`</ph> data member.","source":"The get accessor of `FastDP` returns the value of the `_fastDP` data member."},{"pos":[1183,1292],"content":"The get accessor of <ph id=\"ph1\">`SlowerDP`</ph> waits for 3 seconds before returning the value of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`_slowerDP`</ph> data member.","source":"The get accessor of `SlowerDP` waits for 3 seconds before returning the value of the `_slowerDP` data member."},{"pos":[1299,1410],"content":"The get accessor of <ph id=\"ph1\">`SlowestDP`</ph> waits for 5 seconds before returning the value of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`_slowestDP`</ph> data member.","source":"The get accessor of `SlowestDP` waits for 5 seconds before returning the value of the `_slowestDP` data member."},{"pos":[1418,1819],"content":"[!NOTE]\n This example is for demonstration purposes only.
