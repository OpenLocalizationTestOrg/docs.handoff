A switch statement filters on the cursor name and sets the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property on the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> which is named *DisplayArea*.  \n  \n If the cursor change is set to \"Entire Application\", the <xref:System.Windows.Input.Mouse.OverrideCursor%2A> property is set to the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Cursor%2A> property of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Border> control.  This forces the cursor to change for the whole application.  \n  \n
