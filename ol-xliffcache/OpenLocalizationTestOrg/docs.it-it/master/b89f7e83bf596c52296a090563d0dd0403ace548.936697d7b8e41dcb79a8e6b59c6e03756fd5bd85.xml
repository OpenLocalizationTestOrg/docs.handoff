The common language runtime cannot box certain structure types, for example <xref:System.ArgIterator>, <xref:System.RuntimeArgumentHandle>, and <xref:System.TypedReference>.  \n  \n This expression attempts to use the restricted type to call a method inherited from <xref:System.Object> or <xref:System.ValueType>, such as <xref:System.Object.GetHashCode%2A> or <xref:System.Object.ToString%2A>. To access this method, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] has attempted an implicit boxing conversion that causes this error.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31393  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Locate the expression that evaluates to the cited type.  \n  \n2.
