You can apply simple sorting when the underlying data source is an <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingList>, and you can apply filtering and advanced sorting when the data source is an <xref:System.ComponentModel.IBindingListView>. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Sort%2A> property requires standard [!INCLUDE[vstecado](../../../../includes/vstecado-md.md)] syntax: a string representing the name of a column of data in the data source followed by `ASC` or `DESC` to indicate whether the list should be sorted in ascending or descending order. You can set advanced sorting or multiple-column sorting by separating each column with a comma separator. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property takes a string expression.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Storing sensitive information, such as a password, within the connection string can affect the security of your application. Using Windows Authentication (also known as integrated security) is a more secure way to control access to a database. For more information, see [Protecting Connection Information](../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/protecting-connection-information.md).  \n  \n### To filter data with the BindingSource  \n  \n-   Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Filter%2A> property to expression that you want.  \n  \n     In the following code example, the expression is a column name followed by value that you want for the column.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorFilterAndSort#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorFilterAndSort/CS/form1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorFilterAndSort#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.DataConnectorFilterAndSort/VB/form1.vb#11)]  \n  \n### To sort data with the BindingSource  \n  \n1.
