In [How to: Create a Basic WCF Web HTTP Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-basic-wcf-web-http-service.md), an endpoint is made available to non-SOAP clients. There may be times when you want to make the same contract available both ways, as a Web endpoint and as a SOAP endpoint. This topic shows an example of how to do this.  \n  \n### To define the service contract  \n  \n1.  Define a service contract using an interface marked with the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>, <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attributes, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#0)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#0](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#0)]  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  By default <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebInvokeAttribute> maps POST calls to the operation. You can, however, specify the method to map to the operation by specifying a \"method=\" parameter. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> does not have a \"method=\" parameter and only maps GET calls to the service operation.  \n  \n2.  Implement the service contract, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#1)]  \n  \n### To host the service  \n  \n1.  Create a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> object, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#2)]  \n  \n2.  Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding> for the SOAP endpoint, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#3)]  \n  \n3.  Add a <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint> with <xref:System.ServiceModel.WebHttpBinding> for the non-SOAP endpoint and add the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.WebHttpBehavior> to the endpoint, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#4)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#4](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#4)]  \n  \n4.  Call `Open()` on a <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceHost> instance to open the service host, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#5)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#5](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#5)]  \n  \n### To call service operations mapped to GET in Internet Explorer  \n  \n1.  Open Internet Explorer and type \"`http://localhost:8000/Web/EchoWithGet?s=Hello, world!`\" and press ENTER. The URL contains the base address of the service (\"http://localhost:8000/\"), the relative address of the endpoint (\"\"), the service operation to call (\"EchoWithGet\"), and a question mark followed by a list of named parameters separated by an ampersand (&).  \n  \n### To call service operations on the Web endpoint in code  \n  \n1.  Create an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebChannelFactory%601> within a `using` block, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/cs/program.cs#6)]\n     [!code-vb[htSoapWeb#6](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/htsoapweb/vb/program.vb#6)]  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  `Close()` is automatically called on the channel at the end of the `using` block.  \n  \n1.
