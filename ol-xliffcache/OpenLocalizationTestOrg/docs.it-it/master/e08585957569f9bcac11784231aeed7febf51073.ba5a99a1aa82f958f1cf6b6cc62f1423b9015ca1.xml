This is done, because you can assume that most computers running the Windows operating system will include this directory. This also allows users with minimal system access levels to safely run the application. The example below assumes a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control already added.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub LoadNewPict()  \n       ' You should replace the bold image   \n       ' in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n       PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile _  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath _  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal) _  \n       & \"\\Image.gif\")  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void LoadNewPict(){  \n       // You should replace the bold image   \n       // in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n       // Note the escape character used (@) when specifying the path.  \n       pictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal)  \n       + @\"\\Image.gif\");  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void LoadNewPict()  \n       {  \n          // You should replace the bold image   \n          // in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n          pictureBox1->Image = Image::FromFile(String::Concat(  \n             System::Environment::GetFolderPath(  \n             System::Environment::SpecialFolder::Personal),  \n             \"\\\\Image.gif\"));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n### To clear a graphic  \n  \n-   First, release the memory being used by the image, and then clear the graphic. Garbage collection will free up the memory later if memory management becomes a problem.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    If Not (PictureBox1.Image Is Nothing) Then  \n       PictureBox1.Image.Dispose()  \n       PictureBox1.Image = Nothing  \n    End If  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    if (pictureBox1.Image != null)   \n    {  \n       pictureBox1.Image.Dispose();  \n       pictureBox1.Image = null;  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    if (pictureBox1->Image != nullptr)  \n    {  \n       pictureBox1->Image->Dispose();  \n       pictureBox1->Image = nullptr;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  For more information on why you should use the <xref:System.Drawing.Image.Dispose%2A> method in this way, see [Cleaning Up Unmanaged Resources](../../../../docs/standard/garbage-collection/unmanaged.md).  \n  \n     This code will clear the image even if a graphic was loaded into the control at design time.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
