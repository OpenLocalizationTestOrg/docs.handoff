A null reference exception could occur at run time when the result is used.  \n  \n An operator procedure has at least one possible path through its code that does not return a value.  \n  \n You can return a value from an operator procedure only by including it in a [Return Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md).  \n  \n If control passes to the `End Operator` statement, the operator procedure returns the default value of the property's data type. For more information, see \"Behavior\" in [Function Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md).  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42106  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Check your control flow logic and make sure every possible path ends with a `Return` statement. In particular, the last statement before `End Operator` should be a `Return` statement.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,229],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Operator '<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc42106\"\n  - \"bc42106\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC42106\"\nms.assetid: 175b2bc9-5233-462d-97de-9d97b003cc46","nodes":[{"content":"Operator '<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths","nodes":[{"pos":[0,68],"content":"Operator '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;operatorsymbol&gt;</ph>' doesn't return a value on all code paths","source":"Operator '<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[236,305],"content":"Operator '\\<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths","linkify":"Operator '\\<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths","nodes":[{"content":"Operator '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>operatorsymbol&gt;' doesn't return a value on all code paths","pos":[0,69],"source":"Operator '\\<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths"}]},{"content":"Operator '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>operatorsymbol&gt;' doesn't return a value on all code paths.","pos":[306,376],"source":"Operator '\\<operatorsymbol>' doesn't return a value on all code paths."},{"content":"A null reference exception could occur at run time when the result is used.","pos":[377,452]},{"content":"An operator procedure has at least one possible path through its code that does not return a value.","pos":[459,558]},{"pos":[565,730],"content":"You can return a value from an operator procedure only by including it in a <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Return Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md)</ept>.","source":"You can return a value from an operator procedure only by including it in a [Return Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/return-statement.md)."},{"content":"If control passes to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`End Operator`</ph> statement, the operator procedure returns the default value of the property's data type.","pos":[737,865],"source":"If control passes to the `End Operator` statement, the operator procedure returns the default value of the property's data type."},{"content":"For more information, see \"Behavior\" in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Function Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md)</ept>.","pos":[866,999],"source":" For more information, see \"Behavior\" in [Function Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/function-statement.md)."},{"content":"By default, this message is a warning.","pos":[1006,1044]},{"content":"For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)</ept>.","pos":[1045,1216],"source":" For more information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic)."},{"pos":[1223,1244],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC42106","source":"**Error ID:** BC42106"},{"pos":[1253,1274],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Check your control flow logic and make sure every possible path ends with a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Return`</ph> statement.","pos":[1284,1379],"source":"Check your control flow logic and make sure every possible path ends with a `Return` statement."},{"content":"In particular, the last statement before <ph id=\"ph1\">`End Operator`</ph> should be a <ph id=\"ph2\">`Return`</ph> statement.","pos":[1380,1467],"source":" In particular, the last statement before `End Operator` should be a `Return` statement."},{"pos":[1476,1484],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1488,1599],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[1602,1694],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)"}]}
