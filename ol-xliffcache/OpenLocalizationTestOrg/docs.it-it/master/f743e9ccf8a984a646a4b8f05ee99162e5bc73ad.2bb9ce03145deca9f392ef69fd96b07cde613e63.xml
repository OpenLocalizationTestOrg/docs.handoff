If your <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> has more than one row, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.RowSpan%2A> attached property to the number of rows. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Left> or <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Right> (which alignment you set depends on which two columns you want to resize). Finally, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch>.  \n  \n [!code-xaml[GridSplitterRowColumn#GridSplitterColumnOverlay](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/GridSplitterRowColumn/CS/Window1.xaml#gridsplittercolumnoverlay)]  \n  \n A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that does not have its own column may be obscured by other controls in the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>. For more information about how to prevent this issue, see [Make Sure That a GridSplitter Is Visible](how-to-make-sure-that-a-gridsplitter-is-visible.md).  \n  \n **How to create a GridSplitter that occupies a column**  \n  \n To specify a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that occupies a column in a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid>, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.Column%2A> attached property to one of the columns that you want to resize. If your Grid has more than one row, set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid.RowSpan%2A> attached property to the number of rows. Then set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.HorizontalAlignment%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.HorizontalAlignment.Center>, set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.VerticalAlignment%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.VerticalAlignment.Stretch>, and set the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ColumnDefinition.Width%2A> of the column that contains the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> to <xref:System.Windows.GridLength.Auto%2A>.  \n  \n The following example shows how to define a vertical <xref:System.Windows.Controls.GridSplitter> that occupies a column and resizes the columns on either side of it.  \n  \n
