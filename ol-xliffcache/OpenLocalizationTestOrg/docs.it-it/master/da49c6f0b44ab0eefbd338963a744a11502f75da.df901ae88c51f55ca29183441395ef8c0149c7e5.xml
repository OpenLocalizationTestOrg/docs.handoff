Available since C# 7.2. |  \n  \n Only one access modifier is allowed for a member or type, except when you use the `protected internal` or `private protected` combinations.  \n  \n Access modifiers are not allowed on namespaces. Namespaces have no access restrictions.  \n  \n Depending on the context in which a member declaration occurs, only certain declared accessibilities are permitted. If no access modifier is specified in a member declaration, a default accessibility is used.  \n  \n Top-level types, which are not nested in other types, can only have `internal` or `public` accessibility. The default accessibility for these types is `internal`.  \n  \n Nested types, which are members of other types, can have declared accessibilities as indicated in the following table.  \n  \n|Members of|Default member accessibility|Allowed declared accessibility of the member|  \n|----------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|  \n|`enum`|`public`|None|  \n|`class`|`private`|`public`<br /><br /> `protected`<br /><br /> `internal`<br /><br /> `private`<br /><br /> `protected internal` <br /><br />`private protected`|  \n|`interface`|`public`|None|  \n|`struct`|`private`|`public`<br /><br /> `internal`<br /><br /> `private`|  \n  \n The accessibility of a nested type depends on its [accessibility domain](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/accessibility-domain.md), which is determined by both the declared accessibility of the member and the accessibility domain of the immediately containing type.
