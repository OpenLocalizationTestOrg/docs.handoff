A workflow service contains one or more <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activities and each <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Receive> activity is expecting a specific message. Without particular transport delivery guarantees, messages sent by clients may be delayed and therefore delivered in an order the workflow service may not expect. Implementing a workflow service that does not require messages be sent in a specific order is normally done using a Parallel activity. For a more complicated application protocol, the workflow would become very complex very quickly.  The out-of-order message processing feature in [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] allows you to create such a workflow without all of the complexity of nested Parallel activities. Out-of-order message processing is only supported on channels that support <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ReceiveContext> such as the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] MSMQ bindings.  \n  \n## Enabling Out-Of-Order Message Processing  \n Out-of-order message processing is enabled by setting the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowService.AllowBufferedReceive%2A> property to `true` on the WorkflowService. The following example shows how to set the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.WorkflowService.AllowBufferedReceive%2A> property in code.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Code: Opt-in to Buffered Receive processing...  \nWorkflowService service = new WorkflowService  \n{  \n    Name=\"MyService\",  \n    Body = workflow,  \n    AllowBufferedReceive = true  \n};  \n  \n```  \n  \n You can also apply the `AllowBufferedReceive` attribute to a workflow service in XAML as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```xaml  \n// Xaml: Opt-in to Buffered Receive processing...  \n<WorkflowService AllowBufferedReceive=\"True\">  \n   <!—the actual children activities -->  \n</Sequence>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.ReceiveContext>   \n [Workflow
