If a procedure in another assembly in the same project attempts to override the `Friend` procedure, it cannot access it to override it.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31417  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Move the overriding procedure or property to the same assembly as the procedure or property it is to override.  \n  \n     -or-  \n  \n-   Remove the `Overrides` keyword.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)\n- [Overrides](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md)\n- [Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,259],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<procedurename1>' cannot override '<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc31417\"\n  - \"vbc31417\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31417\"\nms.assetid: 1a36acbf-cead-43a0-b12f-f52f94d09124","nodes":[{"content":"'<procedurename1>' cannot override '<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context","nodes":[{"pos":[0,98],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;procedurename1&gt;</ph>' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;procedurename2&gt;</ph>' because it is not accessible in this context","source":"'<procedurename1>' cannot override '<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[266,366],"content":"'\\<procedurename1>' cannot override '\\<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context","linkify":"'\\<procedurename1>' cannot override '\\<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>procedurename1&gt;' cannot override '<ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>procedurename2&gt;' because it is not accessible in this context","pos":[0,100],"source":"'\\<procedurename1>' cannot override '\\<procedurename2>' because it is not accessible in this context"}]},{"content":"A procedure or property overrides a procedure or property with an access level that prevents access by the overriding procedure or property.","pos":[367,507]},{"content":"For example, if a procedure is declared as <ph id=\"ph1\">`Friend`</ph> in one assembly, it cannot be accessed outside that assembly.","pos":[514,627],"source":"For example, if a procedure is declared as `Friend` in one assembly, it cannot be accessed outside that assembly."},{"content":"If a procedure in another assembly in the same project attempts to override the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Friend`</ph> procedure, it cannot access it to override it.","pos":[628,763],"source":" If a procedure in another assembly in the same project attempts to override the `Friend` procedure, it cannot access it to override it."},{"pos":[770,791],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31417","source":"**Error ID:** BC31417"},{"pos":[800,821],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Move the overriding procedure or property to the same assembly as the procedure or property it is to override.","pos":[831,941]},{"content":"-or-","pos":[952,956]},{"pos":[966,997],"content":"Remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Overrides`</ph> keyword.","source":"Remove the `Overrides` keyword."},{"pos":[1006,1014],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1018,1140],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Access levels in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)</ept>","source":"[Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)"},{"pos":[1143,1216],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overrides<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md)</ept>","source":"[Overrides](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/overrides.md)"},{"pos":[1219,1425],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Overriding properties and methods in derived classes<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)</ept>","source":"[Overriding properties and methods in derived classes](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md#overriding-properties-and-methods-in-derived-classes)"}]}
