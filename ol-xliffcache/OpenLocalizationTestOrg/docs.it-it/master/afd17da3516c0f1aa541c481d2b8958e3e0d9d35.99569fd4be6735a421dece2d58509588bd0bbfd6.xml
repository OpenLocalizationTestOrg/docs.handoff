They can be found under the `ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor. The instances are named using this pattern:  \n  \n```  \n(ServiceName).(ContractName)@(endpoint listener address)  \n```  \n  \n The data is similar to that collected for individual operations, but is only aggregated across the endpoint.  \n  \n> [!CAUTION]\n>  There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name. When a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] counter instance name exceeds the maximum length, [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] replaces a portion of the instance name with a hash value.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Performance Counters](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/performance-counters/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[356,385],"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","linkify":"Endpoint Performance Counters","nodes":[{"content":"Endpoint Performance Counters","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Endpoint performance counters capture data that reveals how an endpoint is accepting messages.","pos":[386,480]},{"content":"They can be found under the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0`</ph> performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor.","pos":[481,601],"source":" They can be found under the `ServiceModelEndpoint 4.0.0.0` performance object when viewing with the Performance Monitor."},{"content":"The instances are named using this pattern:","pos":[602,645]},{"content":"The data is similar to that collected for individual operations, but is only aggregated across the endpoint.","pos":[726,834]},{"pos":[842,1162],"content":"[!CAUTION]\n There is a limit on the length of a performance counter instance's name.
