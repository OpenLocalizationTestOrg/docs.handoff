The order of execution can significantly affect the query result.  \n  \n Operators have the precedence levels shown in the following table. An operator with a higher level is evaluated before an operator with a lower level.  \n  \n|Level|Operation type|Operator|  \n|-----------|--------------------|--------------|  \n|1|Primary|`. , [] ()`|  \n|2|Unary|`! not`|  \n|3|Multiplicative|`* / %`|  \n|4|Additive|`+ -`|  \n|5|Ordering|`< > <= >=`|  \n|6|Equality|`= != <>`|  \n|7|Conditional AND|`and &&`|  \n|8|Conditional OR|`or &#124;&#124;`|  \n  \n When two operators in an expression have the same operator precedence level, they are evaluated left to right, based on their position in the query. For example, `x+y-z` is evaluated as `(x+y)-z`.  \n  \n You can use parentheses to override the defined precedence of the operators in a query. Everything within parentheses is evaluated first to yield a single result before that result can be used by any operator outside the parentheses. For example, `x+y*z` multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds `x`, but `(x+y)*z` adds `x` to `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[414,446],"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","linkify":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"When an <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> query has multiple operators, operator precedence determines the sequence in which the operations are performed.","pos":[447,623],"source":"When an [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query has multiple operators, operator precedence determines the sequence in which the operations are performed."},{"content":"The order of execution can significantly affect the query result.","pos":[624,689]},{"content":"Operators have the precedence levels shown in the following table.","pos":[696,762]},{"content":"An operator with a higher level is evaluated before an operator with a lower level.","pos":[763,846]},{"content":"Level","pos":[853,858]},{"content":"Operation type","pos":[859,873]},{"content":"Operator","pos":[874,882]},{"content":"1","pos":[939,940]},{"content":"Primary","pos":[941,948]},{"content":"2","pos":[965,966]},{"content":"Unary","pos":[967,972]},{"content":"3","pos":[985,986]},{"content":"Multiplicative","pos":[987,1001]},{"content":"4","pos":[1014,1015]},{"content":"Additive","pos":[1016,1024]},{"content":"5","pos":[1035,1036]},{"content":"Ordering","pos":[1037,1045]},{"content":"6","pos":[1062,1063]},{"content":"Equality","pos":[1064,1072]},{"content":"7","pos":[1087,1088]},{"content":"Conditional AND","pos":[1089,1104]},{"content":"8","pos":[1118,1119]},{"content":"Conditional OR","pos":[1120,1134]},{"content":"When two operators in an expression have the same operator precedence level, they are evaluated left to right, based on their position in the query.","pos":[1160,1308]},{"content":"For example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`x+y-z`</ph> is evaluated as <ph id=\"ph2\">`(x+y)-z`</ph>.","pos":[1309,1356],"source":" For example, `x+y-z` is evaluated as `(x+y)-z`."},{"content":"You can use parentheses to override the defined precedence of the operators in a query.","pos":[1363,1450]},{"content":"Everything within parentheses is evaluated first to yield a single result before that result can be used by any operator outside the parentheses.","pos":[1451,1596]},{"content":"For example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`x+y*z`</ph> multiplies <ph id=\"ph2\">`y`</ph> by <ph id=\"ph3\">`z`</ph> and then adds <ph id=\"ph4\">`x`</ph>, but <ph id=\"ph5\">`(x+y)*z`</ph> adds <ph id=\"ph6\">`x`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph7\">`y`</ph> and then multiplies the result by <ph id=\"ph8\">`z`</ph>.","pos":[1597,1727],"source":" For example, `x+y*z` multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds `x`, but `(x+y)*z` adds `x` to `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`."},{"pos":[1736,1744],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1748,1860],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)"}]}
