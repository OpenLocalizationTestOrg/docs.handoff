Pass the name of a file (or a stream) to a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> constructor. After you have created a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object, pass that <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n The example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object from an EMF (enhanced metafile) file and then draws the image with its upper-left corner at (60, 10).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the metafile drawn at the specified location.  \n  \n ![Image
