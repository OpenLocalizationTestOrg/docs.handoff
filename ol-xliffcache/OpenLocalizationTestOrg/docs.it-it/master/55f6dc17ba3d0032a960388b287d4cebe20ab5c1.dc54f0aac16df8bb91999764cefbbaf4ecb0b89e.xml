One must have a widening conversion to the other.  \n  \n The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument. For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim first? As Integer  \nDim second As String = \"First is Nothing\"  \n'' Not valid.  \n' Console.WriteLine(If(first, second))  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33110  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:  \n  \n    ```  \n    Console.WriteLine(If(first, CInt(second)))   \n    ```  \n  \n-   Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.  \n  \n    ```  \n    If first IsNot Nothing Then  \n        Console.WriteLine(first)  \n    Else  \n        Console.WriteLine(second)  \n    End If  \n    ```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)   \n [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)   \n [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,125],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39; operator | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &amp;#39;If&amp;#39; operator | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,113],"source":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39; operator | Microsoft Docs"}]},{"pos":[641,737],"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39; operator","linkify":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39; operator","nodes":[{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &amp;#39;If&amp;#39; operator","pos":[0,96],"source":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary &#39;If&#39; operator"}]},{"content":"Cannot infer a common type for the first and second operands of the binary 'If' operator.","pos":[738,827]},{"content":"One must have a widening conversion to the other.","pos":[828,877]},{"content":"The binary <ph id=\"ph1\">`If`</ph> operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument.","pos":[884,1006],"source":"The binary `If` operator requires that there be a widening conversion between one of the arguments and the other argument."},{"content":"For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between <ph id=\"ph1\">`Integer`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`String`</ph>, the following code causes this error.","pos":[1007,1152],"source":" For example, because there is not a widening conversion in either direction between `Integer` and `String`, the following code causes this error."},{"pos":[1301,1322],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33110","source":"**Error ID:** BC33110"},{"pos":[1331,1352],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Provide an explicit conversion for one of the operands, if that is possible in your code:","pos":[1362,1451]},{"content":"Rewrite the code by using a different conditional construction.","pos":[1534,1597]},{"pos":[1758,1766],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1770,1848],"source":"[If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Widening and Narrowing Conversions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1851,1994],"source":" [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>If...Then...Else Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)</ept>","pos":[1997,2102],"source":" [If...Then...Else Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/if-then-else-statement.md)"}]}
