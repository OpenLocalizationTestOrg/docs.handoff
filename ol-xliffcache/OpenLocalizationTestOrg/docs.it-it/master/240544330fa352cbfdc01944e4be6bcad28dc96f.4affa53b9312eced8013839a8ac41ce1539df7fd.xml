This parameter must be 0.\n\n`pstrName`\\\n[out] A new `BSTR` that contains the property name. You can set this parameter to `null` if the name is not required.\n\n`pVal`\\\n[out] A `VARIANT` filled with the value of the property. You can set this parameter to `null` if the value is not required. If the function returns an error code, the `VARIANT` passed to `pVal` is left unmodified.\n\n`pvtType`\\\n[out] A pointer to a `CIMTYPE` variable (a `LONG` into which the type of the property is placed). The value of this property can be a `VT_NULL_VARIANT`, in which case it is necessary to determine the actual type of the property. This parameter can also be `null`.\n\n`plFlavor`\\\n[out] `null`, or a value that receives information on the origin of the property. See the [Remarks] section for possible values.\n\n## Return value\n\nThe following values returned by this function are defined in the *WbemCli.h* header file, or you can define them as constants in your code:\n\n|Constant  |Value  |Description  |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `WBEM_E_FAILED` | 0x80041001 | There has been a general failure. |\n| `WBEM_E_INVALID_PARAMETER` | 0x80041008 | A parameter is invalid. |\n| `WBEM_E_UNEXPECTED` | 0x8004101d | There was no call to the [`BeginEnumeration`](beginenumeration.md) function. |\n| `WBEM_E_OUT_OF_MEMORY` | 0x80041006 | Not enough memory is available to begin a new enumeration. |\n| `WBEM_E_TRANSPORT_FAILURE` | 0x80041015 | The remote procedure call between the current process and Windows Management failed. |\n| `WBEM_S_NO_ERROR` | 0 | The function call was successful.  |\n| `WBEM_S_NO_MORE_DATA` | 0x40005 | There are no more properties in the enumeration. |\n\n## Remarks\n\nThis function wraps a call to the [IWbemClassObject::Next](/windows/desktop/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemclassobject-next) method.\n\nThis method also returns system properties.\n\nIf the underlying type of the property is an object path, a date or time, or another special type, then the returned type does not contain enough information. The caller must examine the `CIMTYPE` for the specified property to determine if the property is an object reference, a date or time, or another special type.\n\nIf `plFlavor` is not `null`, the `LONG` value receives information about the origin of the property, as follows:\n\n|Constant  |Value  |Description  |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_SYSTEM` | 0x40 | The property is a standard system property. |\n| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_PROPAGATED` | 0x20 | For a class: The property is inherited from the parent class. <br> For an instance: The property, while inherited from the parent class, has not been modified by the instance.  |\n| `WBEM_FLAVOR_ORIGIN_LOCAL` | 0 | For a class: The property belongs to the derived class. <br> For an instance: The property is modified by the instance; that is, a value was supplied, or a qualifier was added or modified. |\n\n## Requirements\n\n**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).\n\n**Header:** WMINet_Utils.idl\n\n**.NET Framework Versions:**
