Replace the [keyword](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md) with a user-specified identifier.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS1041:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS1041a.cs  \nclass MyClass  \n{  \n    public void f(int long)   // CS1041  \n    // Try the following instead:  \n    // public void f(int i)  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## Example  \n When you are importing from another programming language that does not have the same set of reserved words, you can modify the reserved identifier with the @ prefix, as demonstrated in the following sample.  \n  \n An identifier with an `@` prefix is called a verbatim identifier.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS1041b.cs  \nclass MyClass  \n{  \n    public void f(int long)   // CS1041  \n    // Try the following instead:  \n    // public void f(int @long)  \n    {  \n    }  \n  \n    public static void Main()  \n    {  \n    }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS1041\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS1041\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS1041\"\nms.assetid: 9f62c058-cd28-4cb5-835c-d0f25f4fd08e","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1041","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS1041","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1041","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS1041","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1041","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1041","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Identifier expected, 'keyword' is a keyword","pos":[194,237]},{"content":"A reserved word for the C# language was found where an identifier was expected.","pos":[244,323]},{"content":"Replace the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>keyword<ept id=\"p1\">](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md)</ept> with a user-specified identifier.","pos":[324,430],"source":" Replace the [keyword](../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/index.md) with a user-specified identifier."},{"pos":[439,446],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1041:","pos":[450,488]},{"pos":[733,740],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"When you are importing from another programming language that does not have the same set of reserved words, you can modify the reserved identifier with the @ prefix, as demonstrated in the following sample.","pos":[744,950]},{"pos":[957,1022],"content":"An identifier with an <ph id=\"ph1\">`@`</ph> prefix is called a verbatim identifier.","source":"An identifier with an `@` prefix is called a verbatim identifier."}]}
