You can use the `wildCards` parameter to specify a specific pattern. If you would like to include subdirectories in the search, set the `searchType` parameter to `SearchOption.SearchAllSubDirectories`.  \n  \n An empty collection is returned if no files matching the specified pattern are found.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  For information about returning a file list by using the `DirectoryInfo` class of the `System.IO` namespace, see <xref:System.IO.DirectoryInfo.GetFiles%2A>.  \n  \n### To find files with a specified pattern  \n  \n-   Use the `GetFiles` method, supplying the name and path of the directory you want to search and specifying the pattern. The following example returns all files with the extension `.dll` in the directory and adds them to `ListBox1`.  \n  \n
