This walkthrough demonstrates how you can host the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wmp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wmp-md.md)] as a control on a [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] page.\n\n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:\n\n-   Creating the project.\n\n-   Creating the ActiveX control.\n\n-   Hosting the ActiveX control on a WPF Page.\n\n When you have completed this walkthrough, you will understand how to use [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-actx-md.md)] controls in your [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)]-based application.\n\n## Prerequisites\n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:\n\n-   [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_wmp](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-wmp-md.md)] installed on the computer where Visual Studio is installed.\n\n-   Visual Studio 2010.\n\n## Creating the Project\n\n#### To create and set up the project\n\n1.  Create a WPF Application project named `HostingAxInWpf`.\n\n2.  Add a Windows Forms Control Library project to the solution, and name the project `WmpAxLib`.\n\n3.  In the WmpAxLib project, add a reference to the Windows Media Player assembly, which is named wmp.dll.\n\n4.  Open the **Toolbox**.\n\n5.  Right-click in the **Toolbox**, and then click **Choose Items**.\n\n6.  Click the **COM Components** tab, select the **Windows Media Player** control, and then click **OK**.\n\n     The Windows Media Player control is added to the **Toolbox**.\n\n7.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **UserControl1** file, and then click **Rename**.\n\n8.  Change the name to `WmpAxControl.vb` or `WmpAxControl.cs`, depending on the language.\n\n9. If you are prompted to rename all references, click **Yes**.\n\n## Creating the ActiveX Control\n [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)] automatically generates an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.AxHost> wrapper class for a [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-actx-md.md)] control when the control is added to a design surface. The following procedure creates a managed assembly named AxInterop.WMPLib.dll.\n\n#### To create the ActiveX control\n\n1.  Open WmpAxControl.vb or WmpAxControl.cs in the Windows Forms Designer.\n\n2.  From the **Toolbox**, add the Windows Media Player control to the design surface.\n\n3.  In the Properties window, set the value of the Windows Media Player control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DockStyle.Fill>.\n\n4.  Build the WmpAxLib control library project.\n\n## Hosting the ActiveX Control on a WPF Page\n\n#### To host the ActiveX control\n\n1.  In the HostingAxInWpf project, add a reference to the generated [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_actx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-actx-md.md)] interoperability assembly.\n\n     This assembly is named AxInterop.WMPLib.dll and was added to the Debug folder of the WmpAxLib project when you imported the Windows Media Player control.\n\n2.  Add a reference to the WindowsFormsIntegration assembly, which is named WindowsFormsIntegration.dll.\n\n3.  Add a reference to the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)] assembly, which is named System.Windows.Forms.dll.\n\n4.  Open MainWindow.xaml in the WPF Designer.\n\n5.  Name the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Grid> element `grid1`.\n\n     [!code-xaml[HostingAxInWpf#1](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/CSharp/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml#1)]\n\n6.  In Design view or XAML view, select the <xref:System.Windows.Window> element.\n\n7.  In the Properties window, click the **Events** tab.\n\n8.  Double-click the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.\n\n9. Insert the following code to handle the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event.\n\n     This code creates an instance of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost> control and adds an instance of the `AxWindowsMediaPlayer` control as its child.\n\n     [!code-csharp[HostingAxInWpf#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/CSharp/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml.cs#11)]\n     [!code-vb[HostingAxInWpf#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HostingAxInWpf/VisualBasic/HostingAxInWpf/window1.xaml.vb#11)]  \n  \n10. Press F5 to build and run the application.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>\n- [Design XAML in
