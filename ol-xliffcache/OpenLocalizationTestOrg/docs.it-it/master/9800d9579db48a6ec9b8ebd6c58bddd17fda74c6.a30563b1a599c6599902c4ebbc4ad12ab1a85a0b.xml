For more information, see [WPF and Direct3D9 Interoperation](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/wpf-and-direct3d9-interoperation.md) and [Walkthrough: Creating Direct3D9 Content for Hosting in WPF](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-creating-direct3d9-content-for-hosting-in-wpf.md).  \n  \n## Creating the WPF Project  \n The first step is to create the project for the WPF application.  \n  \n#### To create the WPF project  \n  \n-   Create a new WPF Application project in Visual C# named `D3DHost`. For more information, see [How to: Create a New WPF Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/1f6aea7a-33e1-4d3f-8555-1daa42e95d82).  \n  \n     MainWindow.xaml opens in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)].  \n  \n## Importing the Direct3D9 Content  \n You import the Direct3D9 content from an unmanaged DLL by using the `DllImport`attribute.  \n  \n#### To import Direct3D9 content  \n  \n1.  Open MainWindow.xaml.cs in the Code Editor.  \n  \n2.  Replace the automatically generated code with the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/CS/window1.xaml.cs#1)]  \n  \n## Hosting the Direct3D9 Content  \n Finally, use the <xref:System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage> class to host the Direct3D9 content.  \n  \n#### To host the Direct3D9 content  \n  \n1.  In MainWindow.xaml, replace the automatically generated XAML with the following XAML.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage/CS/window1.xaml#10)]  \n  \n2.  Build the project.  \n  \n3.  Copy the DLL that contains the Direct3D9 content to the bin/Debug folder.  \n  \n4.  Press F5 to run the project.  \n  \n     The Direct3D9 content appears within the WPF application.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Interop.D3DImage>   \n [Performance Considerations for
