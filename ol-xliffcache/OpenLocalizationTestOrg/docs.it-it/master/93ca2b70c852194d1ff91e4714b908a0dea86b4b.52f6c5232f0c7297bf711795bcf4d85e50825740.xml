If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n In many scenarios it is not necessary to call `Start`, because the runtime will initialize itself automatically upon the first request to run managed code. You can, however, use `Start` to specify exactly when the runtime should be initialized.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.AppDomain>   \n [ICLRRuntimeHost Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::Start Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::Start Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[702,731],"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::Start Method","linkify":"ICLRRuntimeHost::Start Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICLRRuntimeHost::Start Method","pos":[0,29]}]},{"content":"Initializes the common language runtime (CLR) into a process.","pos":[732,793]},{"pos":[802,808],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[851,863],"content":"Return Value","linkify":"Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Return Value","pos":[0,12]}]},{"content":"HRESULT","pos":[870,877]},{"content":"Description","pos":[878,889]},{"content":"S_OK","pos":[930,934]},{"pos":[935,965],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`Start`</ph> returned successfully.","source":"`Start` returned successfully."},{"content":"HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE","pos":[970,992]},{"content":"The CLR has not been loaded into a process, or the CLR is in a state in which it cannot run managed code or process the call successfully.","pos":[993,1131]},{"content":"HOST_E_TIMEOUT","pos":[1136,1150]},{"content":"The call timed out.","pos":[1151,1170]},{"content":"HOST_E_NOT_OWNER","pos":[1175,1191]},{"content":"The caller does not own the lock.","pos":[1192,1225]},{"content":"HOST_E_ABANDONED","pos":[1230,1246]},{"content":"An event was canceled while a blocked thread or fiber was waiting on it.","pos":[1247,1319]},{"content":"E_FAIL","pos":[1324,1330]},{"content":"An unknown catastrophic failure occurred.","pos":[1331,1372]},{"content":"If a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process.","pos":[1373,1448]},{"content":"Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.","pos":[1449,1515]},{"pos":[1525,1532],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In many scenarios it is not necessary to call <ph id=\"ph1\">`Start`</ph>, because the runtime will initialize itself automatically upon the first request to run managed code.","pos":[1536,1691],"source":"In many scenarios it is not necessary to call `Start`, because the runtime will initialize itself automatically upon the first request to run managed code."},{"content":"You can, however, use <ph id=\"ph1\">`Start`</ph> to specify exactly when the runtime should be initialized.","pos":[1692,1780],"source":" You can, however, use `Start` to specify exactly when the runtime should be initialized."},{"pos":[1789,1801],"content":"Requirements","linkify":"Requirements","nodes":[{"content":"Requirements","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[1805,1909],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Platforms:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> See <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>System Requirements<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)</ept>.","source":"**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md)."},{"pos":[1916,1937],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Header:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> MSCorEE.h","source":"**Header:** MSCorEE.h"},{"pos":[1944,1994],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Library:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll","source":"**Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll"},{"pos":[2001,2109],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET Framework Versions:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]</ph>","source":"**.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]"},{"pos":[2118,2126],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>ICLRRuntimeHost Interface<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-interface.md)</ept>","pos":[2157,2264],"source":" [ICLRRuntimeHost Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrruntimehost-interface.md)"}]}
