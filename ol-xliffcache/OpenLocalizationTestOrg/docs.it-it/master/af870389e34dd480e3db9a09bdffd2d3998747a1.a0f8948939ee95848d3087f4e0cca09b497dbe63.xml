The XML tree is populated with all nodes that are written to the <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>.  \n  \n You would typically use this method when you use [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] with another class that expects to write to an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>, such as <xref:System.Xml.Xsl.XslCompiledTransform>.  \n  \n## Example  \n One possible use for <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A> is when invoking an XSLT transformation. This example creates an XML tree, creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> from the XML tree, creates a new document, and then creates an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter> to write into the new document. It then invokes the XSLT transformation, passing in <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>. After the transformation successfully completes, the new XML tree is populated with the results of the transformation.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim xslMarkup As XDocument = _  \n    <?xml version='1.0'?>   \n    <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl='http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform' version='1.0'>  \n        <xsl:template match='/Parent'>  \n            <Root>  \n                <C1>  \n                    <xsl:value-of select='Child1'/>  \n                </C1>  \n                <C2>  \n                    <xsl:value-of select='Child2'/>  \n                </C2>  \n            </Root>  \n        </xsl:template>  \n    </xsl:stylesheet>  \n  \nDim xmlTree As XDocument = _  \n    <?xml version='1.0'?>  \n    <Parent>  \n        <Child1>Child1 data</Child1>  \n        <Child2>Child2 data</Child2>  \n    </Parent>  \n  \nDim newTree As XDocument = New XDocument()  \nUsing writer As XmlWriter = newTree.CreateWriter()  \n    ' Load the style sheet.  \n    Dim xslt As XslCompiledTransform = New XslCompiledTransform()  \n    xslt.Load(xslMarkup.CreateReader())  \n  \n    ' Execute the transformation and output the results to a writer.  \n    xslt.Transform(xmlTree.CreateReader(), writer)  \nEnd Using  \n  \nConsole.WriteLine(newTree)  \n```  \n  \n This example produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Root>  \n  <C1>Child1 data</C1>  \n  <C2>Child2 data</C2>  \n</Root>  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XContainer.CreateWriter%2A>   \n <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter>   \n
