It involves making design and programming decisions that are not based on culture-specific assumptions. While a globalized application is not localized, it nevertheless is designed and written so that it can be subsequently localized into one or more languages with relative ease.\n\n[Localizability review](localizability-review.md)\n\nThis step involves reviewing an application's code and design to ensure that it can be localized easily and to identify potential roadblocks for localization, and verifying that the application's executable code is separated from its resources. If the globalization stage was effective, the localizability review will confirm the design and coding choices made during globalization. The localizability stage may also identify any remaining issues so that an application's source code doesn't have to be modified during the localization stage.\n\n[Localization](localization.md)\n\nThis step involves customizing an application for specific cultures or regions. If the globalization and localizability steps have been performed correctly, localization consists primarily of translating the user interface.\n\nFollowing these three steps provides two advantages:\n\n-   It frees you from having to retrofit an application that is designed to support a single culture, such as U.S. English, to support additional cultures.\n\n-   It results in localized applications that are more stable and have fewer bugs.\n\n.NET provides extensive support for the development of world-ready and localized applications. In particular, many type members in the .NET class library aid globalization by returning values that reflect the conventions of either the current user's culture or a specified culture. Also, .NET supports satellite assemblies, which facilitate the process of localizing an application.\n\nFor additional information, see the [Globalization documentation](/globalization/).\n\n## In
