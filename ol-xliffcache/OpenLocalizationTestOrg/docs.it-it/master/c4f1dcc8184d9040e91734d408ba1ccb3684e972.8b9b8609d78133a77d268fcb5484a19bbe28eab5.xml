Note that at the transport level multiple messages can be exchanged between clients and services for a single operation. This may be due to infrastructure behavior, security being a good example. Therefore, the number of **MessageSentByTransport** events that are emitted vary based on your service's binding and its configuration.  \n  \n## Message  \n The transport sent a message to '%1'.  \n  \n## Details  \n  \n|Data Item Name|Data Item Type|Description|  \n|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|DestinationAddress|`xs:string`|The address that the request message was sent to.|  \n|HostReference|xs:string|For Web-hosted services, this field uniquely identifies the service in the Web hierarchy.
