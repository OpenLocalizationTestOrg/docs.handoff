The option is disabled by default. Use **/highentropyva+** or **/highentropyva** to enable it.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The **/highentropyva** option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR. Using higher degrees of entropy means that a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps. As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.  \n  \n When the **/highentropyva** compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,65],"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"-highentropyva (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,53]}]},{"pos":[669,705],"content":"/highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","linkify":"/highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"/highentropyva (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,36]}]},{"pos":[706,866],"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> compiler option tells the Windows kernel whether a particular executable supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).","source":"The **/highentropyva** compiler option tells the Windows kernel whether a particular executable supports high entropy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)."},{"pos":[875,881],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[929,938],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`+`</ph> &amp;#124; <ph id=\"ph2\">`-`</ph>","pos":[942,956],"source":"`+` &#124; `-`"},{"content":"This option specifies that a 64-bit executable or an executable that is marked by the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/platform:anycpu<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/platform-compiler-option.md)</ept> compiler option supports a high entropy virtual address space.","pos":[960,1208],"source":" This option specifies that a 64-bit executable or an executable that is marked by the [/platform:anycpu](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/platform-compiler-option.md) compiler option supports a high entropy virtual address space."},{"content":"The option is disabled by default.","pos":[1209,1243]},{"content":"Use <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/highentropyva+<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>/highentropyva<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> to enable it.","pos":[1244,1303],"source":" Use **/highentropyva+** or **/highentropyva** to enable it."},{"pos":[1312,1319],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR.","pos":[1323,1507],"source":"The **/highentropyva** option enables compatible versions of the Windows kernel to use higher degrees of entropy when randomizing the address space layout of a process as part of ASLR."},{"content":"Using higher degrees of entropy means that a larger number of addresses can be allocated to memory regions such as stacks and heaps.","pos":[1508,1640]},{"content":"As a result, it is more difficult to guess the location of a particular memory region.","pos":[1641,1727]},{"pos":[1734,1967],"content":"When the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/highentropyva<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process.","source":"When the **/highentropyva** compiler option is specified, the target executable and any modules that it depends on must be able to handle pointer values that are larger than 4 gigabytes (GB) when they are running as a 64-bit process."}]}
