This topic explains how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services can use the same database to authenticate and authorize users.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Custom User Name and Password Validator](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-use-a-custom-user-name-and-password-validator.md)  \n Demonstrates how to integrate a custom user name/password validator.  \n  \n [Service Identity and Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/service-identity-and-authentication.md)  \n As an extra safeguard, a client can authenticate the service by specifying the expected *identity* of the service. If the expected identity and the identity returned by the service do not match, authentication fails.  \n  \n [Security Negotiation and Timeouts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security-negotiation-and-timeouts.md)  \n Describes how to use the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings.NegotiationTimeout%2A> property in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalServiceSecuritySettings> class.  \n  \n [Debugging Windows Authentication Errors](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/debugging-windows-authentication-errors.md)  \n Focuses on common problems encountered when using Windows authentication.
