The following example generates CS0542 because `F` is a method, not a constructor, because it has a return type:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0542.cs  \nclass F  \n{  \n   // Remove void from F() to resolve the problem.  \n   void F()   // CS0542, same name as the class  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n  \nclass MyClass  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n If your class is named 'Item' and has an indexer declared as `this`, you may get this error. A default indexer is given the name 'Item' in the emitted code, creating the conflict.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0542b.cs  \nclass Item  \n{  \n   public int this[int i]  // CS0542  \n   {  \n      get  \n      {  \n         return 0;  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n  \nclass CMain  \n{  \n   public static void Main()  \n   {  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS0542 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0542 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS0542","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0542","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0542","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"'user-defined type' : member names cannot be the same as their enclosing type","pos":[587,664]},{"content":"The members of a class or struct cannot have the same name as the class or struct, unless the member is a constructor.","pos":[671,789]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0542:","pos":[796,834]},{"content":"This error might be caused if you inadvertently put a return type on a constructor, which in effect makes it into an ordinary method.","pos":[915,1048]},{"content":"The following example generates CS0542 because <ph id=\"ph1\">`F`</ph> is a method, not a constructor, because it has a return type:","pos":[1049,1161],"source":" The following example generates CS0542 because `F` is a method, not a constructor, because it has a return type:"},{"content":"If your class is named 'Item' and has an indexer declared as <ph id=\"ph1\">`this`</ph>, you may get this error.","pos":[1411,1503],"source":"If your class is named 'Item' and has an indexer declared as `this`, you may get this error."},{"content":"A default indexer is given the name 'Item' in the emitted code, creating the conflict.","pos":[1504,1590]}]}
