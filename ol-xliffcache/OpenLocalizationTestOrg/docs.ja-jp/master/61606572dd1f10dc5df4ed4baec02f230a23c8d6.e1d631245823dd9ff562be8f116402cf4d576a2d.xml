Conversions are either *widening* or *narrowing*, depending on the data capacities of the types involved. They are also *implicit* or *explicit*, depending on the syntax in the source code.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/widening-and-narrowing-conversions.md)  \n Explains conversions classified by whether the destination type can hold the data.  \n  \n [Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/implicit-and-explicit-conversions.md)  \n Discusses conversions classified by whether [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] performs them automatically.  \n  \n [Conversions Between Strings and Other Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/conversions-between-strings-and-other-types.md)  \n Illustrates converting between strings and numeric, `Boolean`, or date/time values.  \n  \n [How to: Convert an Object to Another Type in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/how-to-convert-an-object-to-another-type.md)  \n Shows how to convert an `Object` variable to any other data type.  \n  \n [Array Conversions](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/array-conversions.md)  \n Steps you through the process of converting between arrays of different data types.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/index.md)  \n Introduces the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] data types and describes how to use them.  \n  \n [Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/data-type-summary.md)  \n Lists the elementary data types supplied by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Data Types](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/troubleshooting-data-types.md)  \n Discusses some common problems that can arise when working with data types.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,61],"content":"Type Conversions in Visual Basic | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Type Conversions in Visual Basic | Microsoft
