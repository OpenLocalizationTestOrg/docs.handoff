Some examples of recoloring are changing one color to another, adjusting a color's intensity relative to another color, adjusting the brightness or contrast of all colors, and converting colors to shades of gray.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Use a Color Matrix to Transform a Single Color](how-to-use-a-color-matrix-to-transform-a-single-color.md)  \n Discusses using a color matrix to transform a color.  \n  \n [How to: Translate Image Colors](how-to-translate-image-colors.md)  \n Shows how to translate colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [Using Transformations to Scale Colors](using-transformations-to-scale-colors.md)  \n Explains how to scale colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Rotate Colors](how-to-rotate-colors.md)  \n Describes how to rotate a color using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Shear Colors](how-to-shear-colors.md)  \n Defines shearing and explains how to shear colors using a color matrix.  \n  \n [How to: Use a Color Remap Table](how-to-use-a-color-remap-table.md)  \n Defines remapping and shows how to use a color remap table.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ColorMatrix>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.ColorMap>  \n Describes this class and contains links to all of its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)  \n Provides a list of topics regarding the different types of images.  \n  \n [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)  \n Contains a list of topics that show how to use different types of images.  \n  \n [Using Managed Graphics Classes](using-managed-graphics-classes.md)  \n Contains a list of topics describing how to use managed graphics classes.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,238],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Recoloring Images\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
