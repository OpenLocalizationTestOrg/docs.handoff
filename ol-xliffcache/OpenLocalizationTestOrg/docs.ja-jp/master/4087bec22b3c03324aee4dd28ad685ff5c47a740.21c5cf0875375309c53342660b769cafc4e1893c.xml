You can easily align text drawn with the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> methods by creating the correct formatting object and setting the appropriate format flags.  \n  \n### To draw centered text with GDI+ (DrawString)  \n  \n1.  Use a <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat> with the appropriate <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method to specify centered text.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.AlignDrawnText#10](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlignDrawnText/CS/Form1.cs#10)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Drawing.AlignDrawnText#10](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlignDrawnText/VB/Form1.vb#10)]  \n  \n### To draw centered text with GDI (DrawText)  \n  \n1.  Use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextFormatFlags> enumeration for wrapping as well as vertically and horizontally centering text with the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A> method.  \n  \n
