In the following example, a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> is created for `myMainPanel`. Two buttons, `button1` and `button2`, are added to the panel, and their names registered. Several animations and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> are created. The storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method is used to start the animations.  \n  \n Because `button1`, `button2`, and `myMainPanel` all share the same name scope, any one of them can be used with the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method to start the animations.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-csharp[StoryboardBeginAnimation_procedural_snip#NameScopeExample](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StoryboardBeginAnimation_procedural_snip/CSharp/ScopeExample.cs#namescopeexample)]\n [!code-vb[StoryboardBeginAnimation_procedural_snip#NameScopeExample](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/StoryboardBeginAnimation_procedural_snip/visualbasic/scopeexample.vb#namescopeexample)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard](how-to-animate-a-property-by-using-a-storyboard.md)\n- [Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,315],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Define a Name Scope\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"name scope [WPF], defining\"\n  - \"Storyboards [WPF], animating in procedural code\"\n  - \"animation [WPF], Storyboards [WPF], in procedural code\"\nms.assetid: 4f361925-6a08-40dc-8231-a61111c6b28b","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Name Scope","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"How to: Define a Name Scope","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Name Scope","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[322,349],"content":"How to: Define a Name Scope","linkify":"How to: Define a Name Scope","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define a Name Scope","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"To animate with <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard&gt;</ph> in code, you must create a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.NameScope&gt;</ph> and register the target objects' names with the element that owns that name scope.","pos":[350,556],"source":"To animate with <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> in code, you must create a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> and register the target objects' names with the element that owns that name scope."},{"content":"In the following example, a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.NameScope&gt;</ph> is created for <ph id=\"ph2\">`myMainPanel`</ph>.","pos":[557,646],"source":" In the following example, a <xref:System.Windows.NameScope> is created for `myMainPanel`."},{"content":"Two buttons, <ph id=\"ph1\">`button1`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`button2`</ph>, are added to the panel, and their names registered.","pos":[647,736],"source":" Two buttons, `button1` and `button2`, are added to the panel, and their names registered."},{"content":"Several animations and a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard&gt;</ph> are created.","pos":[737,823],"source":" Several animations and a <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> are created."},{"content":"The storyboard's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A&gt;</ph> method is used to start the animations.","pos":[824,938],"source":" The storyboard's <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method is used to start the animations."},{"pos":[945,1199],"content":"Because <ph id=\"ph1\">`button1`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`button2`</ph>, and <ph id=\"ph3\">`myMainPanel`</ph> all share the same name scope, any one of them can be used with the <ph id=\"ph4\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph5\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A&gt;</ph> method to start the animations.","source":"Because `button1`, `button2`, and `myMainPanel` all share the same name scope, any one of them can be used with the <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard> <xref:System.Windows.Media.Animation.Storyboard.Begin%2A> method to start the animations."},{"pos":[1208,1215],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1630,1638],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1642,1736],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-animate-a-property-by-using-a-storyboard.md)</ept>","source":"[Animate a Property by Using a Storyboard](how-to-animate-a-property-by-using-a-storyboard.md)"},{"pos":[1739,1782],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Animation Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](animation-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Animation Overview](animation-overview.md)"}]}
