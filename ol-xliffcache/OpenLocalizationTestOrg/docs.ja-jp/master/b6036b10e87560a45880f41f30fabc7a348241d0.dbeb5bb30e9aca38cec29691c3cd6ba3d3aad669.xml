If you prefer to follow the tutorial using a pre-built solution, [view or download the sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-vb-mstest/) before you begin. For download instructions, see [Samples and Tutorials](../../samples-and-tutorials/index.md#viewing-and-downloading-samples).\n\n## Creating the source project\n\nOpen a shell window. Create a directory called *unit-testing-vb-mstest* to hold the solution.\nInside this new directory, run [`dotnet new sln`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) to create a new solution. This practice\nmakes it easier to manage both the class library and the unit test project.\nInside the solution directory, create a *PrimeService* directory. You have the following directory and file structure thus far:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-vb-mstest\n    unit-testing-vb-mstest.sln\n    /PrimeService\n```\n\nMake *PrimeService* the current directory and run [`dotnet new classlib -lang VB`](../tools/dotnet-new.md) to create the source project. Rename *Class1.VB* to *PrimeService.VB*. You create a failing implementation of the `PrimeService` class:\n\n```vb\nImports System\n\nNamespace Prime.Services\n    Public Class PrimeService\n        Public Function IsPrime(candidate As Integer) As Boolean\n            Throw New NotImplementedException(\"Please create a test first\")\n        End Function\n    End Class\nEnd Namespace\n```\n\nChange the directory back to the *unit-testing-vb-using-stest* directory. Run [`dotnet sln add .\\PrimeService\\PrimeService.vbproj`](../tools/dotnet-sln.md)\nto add the class library project to the solution.\n\n## Creating the test project\n\nNext, create the *PrimeService.Tests* directory. The following outline shows the directory structure:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-vb-mstest\n    unit-testing-vb-mstest.sln\n    /PrimeService\n        Source Files\n        PrimeService.vbproj\n    /PrimeService.Tests\n```\n\nMake the *PrimeService.Tests* directory the current directory and create a new project using [`dotnet new mstest -lang VB`](../tools/dotnet-new.md). This command creates a test project that uses MSTest as the test library. The generated template configures the test runner in the *PrimeServiceTests.vbproj*:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"15.5.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"MSTest.TestAdapter\" Version=\"1.1.18\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"MSTest.TestFramework\" Version=\"1.1.18\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThe test project requires other packages to create and run unit tests. `dotnet new` in the previous step added MSTest and the MSTest runner. Now, add the `PrimeService` class library as another dependency to the project. Use the [`dotnet add reference`](../tools/dotnet-add-reference.md) command:\n\n```\ndotnet add reference ../PrimeService/PrimeService.vbproj\n```\n\nYou can see the entire file in the [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-vb-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.vbproj) on GitHub.\n\nYou have the following final solution layout:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-vb-mstest\n    unit-testing-vb-mstest.sln\n    /PrimeService\n        Source Files\n        PrimeService.vbproj\n    /PrimeService.Tests\n        Test Source Files\n        PrimeServiceTests.vbproj\n```\n\nExecute [`dotnet sln add .\\PrimeService.Tests\\PrimeService.Tests.vbproj`](../tools/dotnet-sln.md) in the *unit-testing-vb-mstest* directory.\n\n## Creating the first test\n\nYou write one failing test, make it pass, then repeat the process. Remove *UnitTest1.vb* from the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and create a new Visual Basic file named *PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.VB*. Add the following code:\n\n```vb\nImports Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting\n\nNamespace PrimeService.Tests\n    <TestClass>\n    Public Class PrimeService_IsPrimeShould\n        Private _primeService As Prime.Services.PrimeService = New Prime.Services.PrimeService()\n\n        <TestMethod>\n        Sub ReturnFalseGivenValueOf1()\n            Dim result As Boolean = _primeService.IsPrime(1)\n\n            Assert.False(result, \"1 should not be prime\")\n        End Sub\n\n    End Class\nEnd Namespace\n```\n\nThe `<TestClass>` attribute indicates a class that contains tests. The `<TestMethod>` attribute denotes a method that is run by the test runner. From the *unit-testing-vb-mstest*, execute [`dotnet test`](../tools/dotnet-test.md) to build the tests and the class library and then run the tests. The MSTest test runner contains the program entry point to run your tests. `dotnet test` starts the test runner using the unit test project you've created.\n\nYour test fails. You haven't created the implementation yet. Make this test by writing the simplest code in the `PrimeService` class that works:\n\n```vb\nPublic Function IsPrime(candidate As Integer) As Boolean\n    If candidate = 1 Then\n        Return False\n    End If\n    Throw New NotImplementedException(\"Please create a test first\")\nEnd Function\n```\n\nIn the *unit-testing-vb-mstest* directory, run `dotnet test` again. The `dotnet test` command runs a build for the `PrimeService` project and then for the `PrimeService.Tests` project. After building both projects, it runs this single test. It passes.\n\n## Adding more features\n\nNow that you've made one test pass, it's time to write more. There are a few other simple cases for prime numbers: 0, -1. You could add those cases as new tests with the `<TestMethod>` attribute, but that quickly becomes tedious. There are other MSTest attributes that enable you to write a suite of similar tests.  A `<DataTestMethod>` attribute represents a suite of tests that execute the same code but have different input arguments. You can use the `<DataRow>` attribute to specify values for those inputs.\n\nInstead of creating new tests, apply these two attributes to create a single theory. The theory is a method that tests several values less than two, which is the lowest prime number:\n\n[!code-vb[Sample_TestCode](../../../samples/core/getting-started/unit-testing-vb-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.vb?name=Sample_TestCode)]\n\nRun `dotnet test`, and two of these tests fail. To make all of the tests pass, change the `if` clause at the beginning of the method:\n\n```vb\nif candidate < 2\n```\n\nContinue to iterate by adding more tests, more theories, and more code in the main library. You have the [finished version of the tests](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-vb-mstest/PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService_IsPrimeShould.vb) and the [complete implementation of the library](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-vb-mstest/PrimeService/PrimeService.vb).\n\nYou've built a small library and a set of unit tests for that library. You've structured the solution so that adding new packages and tests is part of the normal workflow. You've concentrated most of your time and effort on solving the goals of the application.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,329],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Unit testing Visual Basic in
