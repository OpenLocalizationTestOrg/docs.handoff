These are some of the commonly performed tasks you will encounter:  \n  \n-   Adding or removing a tab on a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>.  \n  \n-   Docking a control to its parent.  \n  \n-   Changing the orientation of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control.  \n  \n To speed development, many controls offer smart tags, which are context-sensitive menus that allow you to perform common tasks like these in a single gesture at design time. These tasks are called *smart-tag verbs*.  \n  \n Smart tags remain attached to a control instance for its lifetime in the designer and are always available.  \n  \n Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  \n  \n-   Creating a Windows Forms project  \n  \n-   Using smart tags  \n  \n-   Enabling and Disabling Smart Tags  \n  \n When you are finished, you will have an understanding of the role played by these important layout features.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the project and set up the form.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n1.  Create a Windows-based application project called \"SmartTagsExample\". For details, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa).  \n  \n2.  Select the form in the **Windows Forms Designer**.  \n  \n## Using Smart Tags  \n Smart tags are always available at design time on controls that offer them.  \n  \n#### To use smart tags  \n  \n1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl> from the **Toolbox** onto your form. Note the smart-tag glyph (![Smart Tag Glyph](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/media/vs-winformsmttagglyph.gif \"VS_WinFormSmtTagGlyph\")) that appears on the side of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>.  \n  \n2.  Click the smart-tag glyph. In the shortcut menu that appears next to the glyph, select the **Add Tab** item. Observe that a new tab page is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>.  \n  \n3.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control from the **Toolbox** onto your form.  \n  \n4.  Click the smart-tag glyph. In the shortcut menu that appears next to the glyph, select the **Add Column** item. Observe that a new column is added to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control.  \n  \n5.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control from the **Toolbox** onto your form.  \n  \n6.  Click the smart-tag glyph. In the shortcut menu that appears next to the glyph, select the **Horizontal splitter orientation** item. Observe that the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control's splitter bar is now oriented horizontally.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>   \n <xref:System.ComponentModel.Design.DesignerActionList>   \n [Walkthrough: Adding Smart Tags to a Windows Forms Component](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a6814169-fa7d-4527-808c-637ca5c95f63)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,108],"content":"Walkthrough: Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,96]}]},{"pos":[542,621],"content":"Walkthrough: Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls","linkify":"Walkthrough: Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Performing Common Tasks Using Smart Tags on Windows Forms Controls","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"As you construct forms and controls for your Windows Forms application, there are many tasks you will perform repeatedly.","pos":[622,743]},{"content":"These are some of the commonly performed tasks you will encounter:","pos":[744,810]},{"content":"Adding or removing a tab on a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl&gt;</ph>.","pos":[820,889],"source":"Adding or removing a tab on a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TabControl>."},{"content":"Docking a control to its parent.","pos":[899,931]},{"content":"Changing the orientation of a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[941,1022],"source":"Changing the orientation of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control."},{"content":"To speed development, many controls offer smart tags, which are context-sensitive menus that allow you to perform common tasks like these in a single gesture at design time.","pos":[1029,1202]},{"content":"These tasks are called <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>smart-tag verbs<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[1203,1244],"source":" These tasks are called *smart-tag verbs*."},{"content":"Smart tags remain attached to a control instance for its lifetime in the designer and are always available.","pos":[1251,1358]},{"content":"Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:","pos":[1365,1411]},{"content":"Creating a Windows Forms project","pos":[1421,1453]},{"content":"Using smart tags","pos":[1463,1479]},{"content":"Enabling and Disabling Smart Tags","pos":[1489,1522]},{"content":"When you are finished, you will have an understanding of the role played by these important layout features.","pos":[1529,1637]},{"pos":[1645,2021],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
