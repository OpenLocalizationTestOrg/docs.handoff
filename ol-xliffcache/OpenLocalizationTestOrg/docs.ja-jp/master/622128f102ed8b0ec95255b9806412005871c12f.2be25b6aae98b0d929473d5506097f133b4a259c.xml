You can also assign a delegate to the `OnChange` event, which will fire when the results change for an associated command. You must associate the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDependency> with the command before you execute the command. The `HasChanges` property of the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDependency> can also be used to determine if the query results have changed since the data was first retrieved.  \n  \n## Security Considerations  \n The dependency infrastructure relies on a <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> that is opened when <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlDependency.Start%2A> is called in order to receive notifications that the underlying data has changed for a given command. The ability for a client to initiate the call to `SqlDependency.Start` is controlled through the use of <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlClientPermission> and code access security attributes. For more information, see [Enabling Query Notifications](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/enabling-query-notifications.md) and [Code Access Security and ADO.NET](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/code-access-security.md).  \n  \n### Example  \n The following steps illustrate how to declare a dependency, execute a command, and receive a notification when the result set changes:  \n  \n1.  Initiate a `SqlDependency` connection to the server.  \n  \n2.  Create <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection> and <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand> objects to connect to the server and define a Transact-SQL statement.  \n  \n3.  Create a new `SqlDependency` object, or use an existing one, and bind it to the `SqlCommand` object. Internally, this creates a <xref:System.Data.Sql.SqlNotificationRequest> object and binds it to the command object as needed. This notification request contains an internal identifier that uniquely identifies this `SqlDependency` object. It also starts the client listener if it is not already active.  \n  \n4.  Subscribe an event handler to the `OnChange` event of the `SqlDependency` object.  \n  \n5.  Execute the command using any of the `Execute` methods of the `SqlCommand` object. Because the command is bound to the notification object, the server recognizes that it must generate a notification, and the queue information will point to the dependencies queue.  \n  \n6.  Stop the `SqlDependency` connection to the server.  \n  \n If any user subsequently changes the underlying data, Microsoft SQL Server detects that there is a notification pending for such a change, and posts a notification that is processed and forwarded to the client through the underlying `SqlConnection` that was created by calling `SqlDependency.Start`. The client listener receives the invalidation message. The client listener then locates the associated `SqlDependency` object and fires the `OnChange` event.  \n  \n The following code fragment shows the design pattern you would use to create a sample application.  \n  \n```vb  \nSub Initialization()  \n    ' Create a dependency connection.  \n    SqlDependency.Start(connectionString, queueName)  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nSub SomeMethod()   \n    ' Assume connection is an open SqlConnection.  \n    ' Create a new SqlCommand object.  \n    Using command As New SqlCommand( _  \n      \"SELECT ShipperID, CompanyName, Phone FROM dbo.Shippers\", _  \n      connection)  \n  \n        ' Create a dependency and associate it with the SqlCommand.  \n        Dim dependency As New SqlDependency(command)  \n        ' Maintain the refence in a class member.  \n        ' Subscribe to the SqlDependency event.  \n        AddHandler dependency.OnChange, AddressOf OnDependencyChange  \n  \n        ' Execute the command.  \n        Using reader = command.ExecuteReader()  \n            ' Process the DataReader.  \n        End Using  \n    End Using  \nEnd Sub   \n  \n' Handler method  \nSub OnDependencyChange(ByVal sender As Object, _  \n    ByVal e As SqlNotificationEventArgs)   \n    ' Handle the event (for example, invalidate this cache entry).  \nEnd Sub  \n  \nSub Termination()  \n    ' Release the dependency  \n    SqlDependency.Stop(connectionString, queueName)  \nEnd Sub  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nvoid Initialization()  \n{  \n    // Create a dependency connection.  \n    SqlDependency.Start(connectionString, queueName);  \n}  \n  \nvoid SomeMethod()  \n{  \n    // Assume connection is an open SqlConnection.  \n  \n    // Create a new SqlCommand object.  \n    using (SqlCommand command=new SqlCommand(  \n        \"SELECT ShipperID, CompanyName, Phone FROM dbo.Shippers\",   \n        connection))  \n    {  \n  \n        // Create a dependency and associate it with the SqlCommand.  \n        SqlDependency dependency=new SqlDependency(command);  \n        // Maintain the refence in a class member.  \n  \n        // Subscribe to the SqlDependency event.  \n        dependency.OnChange+=new  \n           OnChangeEventHandler(OnDependencyChange);  \n  \n        // Execute the command.  \n        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())  \n        {  \n            // Process the DataReader.  \n        }  \n    }  \n}  \n  \n// Handler method  \nvoid OnDependencyChange(object sender,   \n   SqlNotificationEventArgs e )  \n{  \n  // Handle the event (for example, invalidate this cache entry).  \n}  \n  \nvoid Termination()  \n{  \n    // Release the dependency.  \n    SqlDependency.Stop(connectionString, queueName);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Query Notifications
