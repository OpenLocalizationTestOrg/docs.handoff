They include examples of the <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate, the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate, and a custom delegate, to illustrate events with and without data.  \n  \n The examples use concepts described in the [Events](../../../docs/standard/events/index.md) article.  \n  \n## Example  \n The first example shows how to raise and consume an event that doesn't have data. It contains a class named `Counter` that has an event named `ThresholdReached`. This event is raised when a counter value equals or exceeds a threshold value. The <xref:System.EventHandler> delegate is associated with the event, because no event data is provided.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[EventsOverview#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cs/programnodata.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[EventsOverview#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1nodata.vb#5)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The next example shows how to raise and consume an event that provides data. The <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate is associated with the event, and an instance of a custom event data object is provided.  \n  \n [!code-cpp[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cpp/programwithdata.cpp#6)]\n [!code-csharp[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/cs/programwithdata.cs#6)]\n [!code-vb[EventsOverview#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/eventsoverview/vb/module1withdata.vb#6)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The next example shows how to declare a delegate for an event. The delegate is named `ThresholdReachedEventHandler`. This is just an illustration. Typically, you do not have to declare a delegate for an event, because you can use either the <xref:System.EventHandler> or the <xref:System.EventHandler%601> delegate. You should declare a delegate only in rare scenarios, such as making your class available to legacy code that cannot use generics.  \n  \n
