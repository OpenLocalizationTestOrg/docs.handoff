The topics in this section step through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity, and the custom activities from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic. The workflow models a number guessing game. Only one of the topics in this section is required to complete the tutorial; you should pick the style that interests you and follow that step. However, you may complete all of the topics if desired.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Each topic in the Getting Started tutorial depends on the previous topics. To complete this topic, you must first complete [How to: Create an Activity](how-to-create-an-activity.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  To download a completed version of the tutorial, see [Windows Workflow Foundation (WF45) - Getting Started Tutorial](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=248976).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Create a Sequential Workflow](how-to-create-a-sequential-workflow.md)  \n Describes how to create a sequential workflow using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence> activity.  \n  \n [How to: Create a Flowchart Workflow](how-to-create-a-flowchart-workflow.md)  \n Describes how to create a flowchart workflow using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity.  \n  \n [How to: Create a State Machine Workflow](how-to-create-a-state-machine-workflow.md)  \n Describes how to create a state machine workflow using the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.StateMachine> activity.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Windows Workflow Foundation Programming](programming.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,109],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Workflow\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 87234108-8e21-4cb3-9340-4a1a13f3f98c","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Workflow","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"How to: Create a Workflow","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Workflow","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[116,141],"content":"How to: Create a Workflow","linkify":"How to: Create a Workflow","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Workflow","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"Workflows can be constructed from built-in activities as well as from custom activities.","pos":[142,230]},{"content":"The topics in this section step through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart&gt;</ph> activity, and the custom activities from the previous <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create an Activity<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-create-an-activity.md)</ept> topic.","pos":[231,503],"source":" The topics in this section step through creating a workflow that uses both built-in activities such as the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Flowchart> activity, and the custom activities from the previous [How to: Create an Activity](how-to-create-an-activity.md) topic."},{"content":"The workflow models a number guessing game.","pos":[504,547]},{"content":"Only one of the topics in this section is required to complete the tutorial; you should pick the style that interests you and follow that step.","pos":[548,691]},{"content":"However, you may complete all of the topics if desired.","pos":[692,747]},{"pos":[755,948],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Each topic in the Getting Started tutorial depends on the previous topics.
