The WPF control is hosted in an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n## Prerequisites  \n You need the following components to complete this walkthrough:  \n  \n-   [!INCLUDE[vs_orcas_long](../../../../includes/vs-orcas-long-md.md)].  \n  \n## Creating the Project  \n The first step is to create the Windows Forms project.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When hosting WPF content, only C# and Visual Basic projects are supported.  \n  \n#### To create the project  \n  \n-   Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Basic or Visual C# named `HostingWpf`.  \n  \n## Creating a New WPF Control  \n Creating a new WPF control and adding it to your project is as easy as adding any other item to your project. The Windows Forms Designer works with a particular kind of control named *composite control*, or *user control*. For more information about WPF user controls, see <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.UserControl?displayProperty=fullName> type for WPF is distinct from the user control type provided by Windows Forms, which is also named <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n#### To create a new WPF control  \n  \n1.  In **Solution Explorer**, add a new **WPF User Control Library** project to the solution. Use the default name for the control library, `WpfControlLibrary1`. The default control name is `UserControl1.xaml`.  \n  \n     Adding the new control has the following effects.  \n  \n    -   File UserControl1.xaml is added.  \n  \n    -   Either file UserControl1.xaml.cs or UserControl1.xaml.vb is added. This file contains the code-behind for event handlers and other implementation.  \n  \n    -   References to WPF assemblies are added.  \n  \n    -   File UserControl1.xaml opens in the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_long](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n2.  In Design view, make sure that `UserControl1` is selected. For more information, see [How to: Select and Move Elements on the Design Surface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/54cb70b6-b35b-46e4-a0cc-65189399c474).  \n  \n3.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Width%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Height%2A> properties to `200`.  \n  \n4.  From the **Toolbox**, drag a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control onto the design surface.  \n  \n5.  In the **Properties** window, set the value of the <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox.Text%2A> property to **Hosted Content**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  In general, you should host more sophisticated WPF content. The <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName> control is used here for illustrative purposes only.  \n  \n6.  Build the project.  \n  \n## Adding a WPF Control to a Windows Form  \n Your new WPF control is ready for use on the form. Windows Forms uses the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control to host WPF content  \n  \n#### To add a WPF control to a Windows Form  \n  \n1.  Open `Form1` in the Windows Forms Designer.  \n  \n2.  In the **Toolbox**, find the tab labeled **WPFUserControlLibrary WPF User Controls**.  \n  \n3.  Drag an instance of `UserControl1` onto the form.  \n  \n    -   An <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control is created automatically on the form to host the WPF control.  \n  \n    -   The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control is named `elementHost1` and in the **Properties** window, you can see its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost.Child%2A> property is set to **UserControl1**.  \n  \n    -   References to WPF assemblies are added to the project.  \n  \n    -   The `elementHost1` control has a smart tag panel that shows the available hosting options.  \n  \n4.  In the **ElementHost Tasks** smart tag panel, select **Dock in parent container**.  \n  \n5.  Press F5 to build and run the application.  \n  \n## Next Steps  \n Windows Forms and WPF are different technologies, but they are designed to interoperate closely. To provide richer appearance and behavior in your applications, try the following.  \n  \n-   Host a Windows Forms control in a WPF page. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Hosting a Windows Forms Control in WPF](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/walkthrough-hosting-a-windows-forms-control-in-wpf.md).  \n  \n-   Apply Windows Forms visual styles to your WPF content. For more information, see [How to: Enable Visual Styles in a Hybrid Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/how-to-enable-visual-styles-in-a-hybrid-application.md).  \n  \n-   Change the style of your WPF content. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Styling WPF Content](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-styling-wpf-content.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.WindowsFormsHost>   \n [Migration and Interoperability](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/migration-and-interoperability.md)   \n [Using WPF Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/using-wpf-controls.md)   \n [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,98],"content":"Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,86]}]},{"pos":[666,735],"content":"Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","linkify":"Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time","pos":[0,69]}]},{"content":"This topic shows you how to create a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) control for use in your Windows Forms-based applications.","pos":[736,868]},{"content":"In this walkthrough, you perform the following tasks:","pos":[875,928]},{"content":"Create the project.","pos":[938,957]},{"content":"Create a new WPF control.","pos":[967,992]},{"content":"Add the new WPF control to a Windows Form.","pos":[1002,1044]},{"content":"The WPF control is hosted in an <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[1045,1137],"source":" The WPF control is hosted in an <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control."},{"pos":[1145,1521],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
