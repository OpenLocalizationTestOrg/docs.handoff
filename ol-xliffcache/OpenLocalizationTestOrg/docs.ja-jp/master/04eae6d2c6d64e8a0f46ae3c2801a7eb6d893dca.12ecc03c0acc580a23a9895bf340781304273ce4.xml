For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has two integer parameters.  \n  \n```vb  \nDelegate Function Del(ByVal p As Integer, ByVal q As Integer) As Integer  \n```  \n  \n The error is raised if a lambda expression with one argument is declared as type `Del`:  \n  \n```vb  \n' Neither of these is valid.   \n' Dim lambda1 As Del = Function(n As Integer) n + 1  \n' Dim lambda2 As Del = Function(n) n + 1  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36532  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Adjust either the delegate definition or the assigned lambda expression so that the signatures are compatible.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)\n- [Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,252],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '<delegatename>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36532\"\n  - \"bc36532\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36532\"\nms.assetid: 493f292c-d81e-40ef-8b47-61f020571829","nodes":[{"content":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '<delegatename>'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,91],"content":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;delegatename&gt;</ph>'","source":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '<delegatename>'"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[259,351],"content":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '\\<delegatename>'","linkify":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '\\<delegatename>'","nodes":[{"content":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>delegatename&gt;'","pos":[0,92],"source":"Nested function does not have a signature that is compatible with delegate '\\<delegatename>'"}]},{"content":"A lambda expression has been assigned to a delegate that has an incompatible signature.","pos":[352,439]},{"content":"For example, in the following code, delegate <ph id=\"ph1\">`Del`</ph> has two integer parameters.","pos":[440,518],"source":" For example, in the following code, delegate `Del` has two integer parameters."},{"pos":[617,704],"content":"The error is raised if a lambda expression with one argument is declared as type <ph id=\"ph1\">`Del`</ph>:","source":"The error is raised if a lambda expression with one argument is declared as type `Del`:"},{"pos":[857,878],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36532","source":"**Error ID:** BC36532"},{"pos":[887,908],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Adjust either the delegate definition or the assigned lambda expression so that the signatures are compatible.","pos":[918,1028]},{"pos":[1037,1045],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1049,1178],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Relaxed Delegate Conversion<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)</ept>","source":"[Relaxed Delegate Conversion](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/delegates/relaxed-delegate-conversion.md)"},{"pos":[1181,1293],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Lambda Expressions<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)</ept>","source":"[Lambda Expressions](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/lambda-expressions.md)"}]}
