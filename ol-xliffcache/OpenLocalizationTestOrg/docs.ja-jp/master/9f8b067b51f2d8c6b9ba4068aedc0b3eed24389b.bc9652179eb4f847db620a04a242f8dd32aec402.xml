The following example causes this error:  \n  \n```  \nDim i As Integer  \nDim result As String  \n' Not valid.  \n' result = (If(i > 0, TruePart:=\"positive\", FalsePart:=\"not positive\")  \n```  \n  \n This differs from the `IIf` function, which does allow named arguments, as shown in the following code:  \n  \n```  \n' Valid.  \nIIf(i > 0, TruePart:=\"positive\", FalsePart:=\"not positive\")  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33105  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the name assignments from the operands, as shown in the following code.  \n  \n    ```  \n    result = If(i > 0, \"positive\", \"not positive\")  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)\n- [Passing Arguments by Position and by Name](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-position-and-by-name.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,200],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'If' operands cannot be named arguments\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc33105\"\n  - \"vbc33105\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33105\"\nms.assetid: 596baeb6-a44f-4d92-beb7-06624b60c00d","nodes":[{"content":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","nodes":[{"content":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[207,246],"content":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","linkify":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","nodes":[{"content":"'If' operands cannot be named arguments","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"Using named arguments in the operands of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`If`</ph> operator is not valid.","pos":[247,319],"source":"Using named arguments in the operands of the `If` operator is not valid."},{"content":"The following example causes this error:","pos":[320,360]},{"pos":[512,615],"content":"This differs from the <ph id=\"ph1\">`IIf`</ph> function, which does allow named arguments, as shown in the following code:","source":"This differs from the `IIf` function, which does allow named arguments, as shown in the following code:"},{"pos":[710,731],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33105","source":"**Error ID:** BC33105"},{"pos":[740,761],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the name assignments from the operands, as shown in the following code.","pos":[771,849]},{"pos":[934,942],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[946,1023],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>If Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[If Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/if-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1026,1181],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Passing Arguments by Position and by Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-position-and-by-name.md)</ept>","source":"[Passing Arguments by Position and by Name](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/passing-arguments-by-position-and-by-name.md)"}]}
