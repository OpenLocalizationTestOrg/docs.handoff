The order of execution can significantly affect the query result.  \n  \n Operators have the precedence levels shown in the following table. An operator with a higher level is evaluated before an operator with a lower level.  \n  \n|Level|Operation type|Operator|  \n|-----------|--------------------|--------------|  \n|1|Primary|`. , [] ()`|  \n|2|Unary|`! not`|  \n|3|Multiplicative|`* / %`|  \n|4|Additive|`+ -`|  \n|5|Ordering|`< > <= >=`|  \n|6|Equality|`= != <>`|  \n|7|Conditional AND|`and &&`|  \n|8|Conditional OR|`or &#124;&#124;`|  \n  \n When two operators in an expression have the same operator precedence level, they are evaluated left to right, based on their position in the query. For example, `x+y-z` is evaluated as `(x+y)-z`.  \n  \n You can use parentheses to override the defined precedence of the operators in a query. Everything within parentheses is evaluated first to yield a single result before that result can be used by any operator outside the parentheses. For example, `x+y*z` multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds `x`, but `(x+y)*z` adds `x` to `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,116],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: e92e4ca5-2889-4266-9625-47f0eb01a948","nodes":[{"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[123,155],"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","linkify":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"Operator Precedence (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"When an <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> query has multiple operators, operator precedence determines the sequence in which the operations are performed.","pos":[156,332],"source":"When an [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] query has multiple operators, operator precedence determines the sequence in which the operations are performed."},{"content":"The order of execution can significantly affect the query result.","pos":[333,398]},{"content":"Operators have the precedence levels shown in the following table.","pos":[405,471]},{"content":"An operator with a higher level is evaluated before an operator with a lower level.","pos":[472,555]},{"content":"Level","pos":[562,567]},{"content":"Operation type","pos":[568,582]},{"content":"Operator","pos":[583,591]},{"content":"1","pos":[648,649]},{"content":"Primary","pos":[650,657]},{"content":"2","pos":[674,675]},{"content":"Unary","pos":[676,681]},{"content":"3","pos":[694,695]},{"content":"Multiplicative","pos":[696,710]},{"content":"4","pos":[723,724]},{"content":"Additive","pos":[725,733]},{"content":"5","pos":[744,745]},{"content":"Ordering","pos":[746,754]},{"content":"6","pos":[771,772]},{"content":"Equality","pos":[773,781]},{"content":"7","pos":[796,797]},{"content":"Conditional AND","pos":[798,813]},{"content":"8","pos":[827,828]},{"content":"Conditional OR","pos":[829,843]},{"content":"When two operators in an expression have the same operator precedence level, they are evaluated left to right, based on their position in the query.","pos":[869,1017]},{"content":"For example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`x+y-z`</ph> is evaluated as <ph id=\"ph2\">`(x+y)-z`</ph>.","pos":[1018,1065],"source":" For example, `x+y-z` is evaluated as `(x+y)-z`."},{"content":"You can use parentheses to override the defined precedence of the operators in a query.","pos":[1072,1159]},{"content":"Everything within parentheses is evaluated first to yield a single result before that result can be used by any operator outside the parentheses.","pos":[1160,1305]},{"content":"For example, <ph id=\"ph1\">`x+y*z`</ph> multiplies <ph id=\"ph2\">`y`</ph> by <ph id=\"ph3\">`z`</ph> and then adds <ph id=\"ph4\">`x`</ph>, but <ph id=\"ph5\">`(x+y)*z`</ph> adds <ph id=\"ph6\">`x`</ph> to <ph id=\"ph7\">`y`</ph> and then multiplies the result by <ph id=\"ph8\">`z`</ph>.","pos":[1306,1436],"source":" For example, `x+y*z` multiplies `y` by `z` and then adds `x`, but `(x+y)*z` adds `x` to `y` and then multiplies the result by `z`."},{"pos":[1445,1453],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1457,1569],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)</ept>","source":"[Entity SQL Overview](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-overview.md)"}]}
