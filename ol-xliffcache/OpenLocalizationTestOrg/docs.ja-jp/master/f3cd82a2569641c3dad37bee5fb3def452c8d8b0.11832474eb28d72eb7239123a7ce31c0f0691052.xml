If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`. If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error. If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31075  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the element name correctly.","nodes":[{"pos":[4,209],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31075\"\n  - \"bc31075\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31075\"\nms.assetid: 614d36a1-2fba-4d03-963c-1565e88b08a6","nodes":[{"content":"'<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;elementname&gt;</ph>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","source":"'<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[216,265],"content":"'\\<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","linkify":"'\\<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","nodes":[{"content":"'<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>elementname&gt;' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)","pos":[0,49],"source":"'\\<elementname>' is obsolete (Visual Basic Error)"}]},{"pos":[266,434],"content":"A statement attempts to access a programming element which has been marked with the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error.","source":"A statement attempts to access a programming element which has been marked with the <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> attribute and the directive to treat it as an error."},{"content":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute&gt;</ph> to it.","pos":[441,554],"source":"You can mark any programming element as being no longer in use by applying <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute> to it."},{"content":"If you do this, you can set the attribute's <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A&gt;</ph> property to either <ph id=\"ph2\">`True`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`False`</ph>.","pos":[555,679],"source":" If you do this, you can set the attribute's <xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute.IsError%2A> property to either `True` or `False`."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`True`</ph>, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error.","pos":[680,767],"source":" If you set it to `True`, the compiler treats an attempt to use the element as an error."},{"content":"If you set it to <ph id=\"ph1\">`False`</ph>, or let it default to <ph id=\"ph2\">`False`</ph>, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element.","pos":[768,896],"source":" If you set it to `False`, or let it default to `False`, the compiler issues a warning if there is an attempt to use the element."},{"pos":[903,924],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31075","source":"**Error ID:** BC31075"},{"pos":[933,954],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the source-code reference is spelling the element name correctly.","pos":[964,1041]}]}
