Use Visual Studio Code with the C# extension to get a powerful editing experience with full support for C# IntelliSense (smart code completion) and debugging.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n2. Install the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core).\n3. Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.\n\n## Hello World\n\nLet's get started with a simple \"Hello World\" program on .NET Core:\n\n1. Open a project:\n\n    * Open VS Code.\n    * Click on the Explorer icon on the left menu and then click **Open Folder**.\n    * Select the folder you want your C# project to be in and click **Select Folder**. For our example, we'll create a folder for our project named 'HelloWorld'. \n\n  ![VSCodeOpenFolder](media/with-visual-studio-code/vscodeopenfolder.png)\n\n    * Alternatively, you can select **File** > **Open Folder** from the main menu to open your project folder.\n\n2. Initialize a C# project:\n    * Open the Integrated Terminal from VS Code by typing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>\\`</kbd> (backtick).\n    * In the terminal window, type `dotnet new console`.\n    * This creates a `Program.cs` file in your folder with a simple \"Hello World\" program already written, along with a C# project file named `HelloWorld.csproj`.\n\n  ![The dotnet new command](media/with-visual-studio-code/dotnetnew.png)\n\n3. Resolve the build assets:\n\n    * Type `dotnet restore`. Running `dotnet restore` gives you access to the  required .NET Core packages that are needed to build your project.\n\n  ![The dotnet restore command](media/with-visual-studio-code/dotnetrestore.png)\n\n4. Run the \"Hello World\" program:\n\n    * Type `dotnet run`. \n\n  ![The dotnet run command](media/with-visual-studio-code/dotnetrun.png)\n\nYou can also watch a short video tutorial for further setup help on [Windows](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core), [macOS](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core-on-MacOS), or [Linux](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-Csharp-dotnet-Core-Ubuntu).\n\n## Debug\n1. Open *Program.cs* by clicking on it. The first time you open a C# file in VS Code, [OmniSharp](http://www.omnisharp.net/) will load in the editor.\n\n  ![Open the Program.cs file](media/with-visual-studio-code/opencs.png)\n\n2. VS Code will prompt you to add the missing assets to build and debug your app. Select **Yes**. \n\n  ![Prompt for missing assets](media/with-visual-studio-code/missing-assets.png)\n\n3. To open the Debug view, click on the Debugging icon on the left side menu.\n\n  ![Open the Debug tab](media/with-visual-studio-code/opendebug.png)\n\n4. Locate the green arrow at the top of the pane. Make sure the drop-down next to it has `.NET Core Launch (console)` selected.\n\n  ![Selecting .NET Core](media/with-visual-studio-code/selectcore.png)\n\n5. Add a breakpoint to your project by clicking on the **editor margin** (the space on the left of the line numbers in the editor) next to line 9.\n\n  ![Setting a Breakpoint](media/with-visual-studio-code/setbreakpoint.png)\n\n6. Select <kbd>F5</kbd> or the green arrow to start debugging. The debugger stops execution of your program when it reaches the breakpoint you set in the previous step.\n    * While debugging you can view your local variables in the top left pane or use the debug console.\n\n  ![Run and Debug](media/with-visual-studio-code/rundebug.png)\n\n7. Select the green arrow at the top to continue debugging, or press the red square to stop.\n\n> [!TIP] \n> For more information and troubleshooting tips on .NET Core debugging with OmniSharp in VS
