It describes the control's [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tlasharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] tree structure and provides the properties and control patterns for specific control scenarios.  \n  \n A menu control allows hierarchal organization of elements associated with commands and event handlers. In a typical [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win](../../../includes/tlasharptla-win-md.md)] application, a menu bar contains several menu buttons (such as **File**, **Edit**, and **Window**), and each menu button displays a menu. A menu contains a collection of menu items (such as **New**, **Open**, and **Close**), which can be expanded to display additional menu items or to perform a specific action when clicked.  \n  \n The following sections define the required [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] tree structure, properties, control patterns, and events for the Menu control type. The [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] requirements apply to all list controls, whether [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winclient](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winclient-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_win32](../../../includes/tlasharptla-win32-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winforms](../../../includes/tlasharptla-winforms-md.md)].  \n  \n<a name=\"Required_UI_Automation_Tree_Structure\"></a>   \n## Required UI Automation Tree Structure  \n The following table depicts the control view and the content view of the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uiautomation](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-uiautomation-md.md)] tree that pertains to menu controls and describes what can be contained in each view.

Menu control types should appear under the control that their information is referring to.
