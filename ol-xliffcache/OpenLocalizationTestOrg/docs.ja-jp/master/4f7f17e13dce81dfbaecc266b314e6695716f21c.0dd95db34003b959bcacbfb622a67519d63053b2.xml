This topic shows how to define mapping attributes for the entity types in a data model that is defined by using the reflection provider. For more information, see [Feed Customization](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/feed-customization-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The data model for this example is defined in the topic [How to: Create a Data Service Using the Reflection Provider](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-rp-wcf-data-services.md)  \n  \n## Example  \n In the following example, both properties of the `Order` type are mapped to existing Atom elements. The `Product` property of the `Item` type is mapped to a custom feed attribute in a separate namespace.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Custom Feeds#CustomIQueryableFeeds](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria custom feeds/cs/orderitems.svc.cs#customiqueryablefeeds)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Custom Feeds#CustomIQueryableFeeds](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria custom feeds/vb/orderitems.svc.vb#customiqueryablefeeds)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The previous example returns the following result for the URI `http://myservice/OrderItems.svc/Orders(0)?$expand=Items`.  \n  \n [!code-xml[Astoria Custom Feeds#IQueryableFeedResultInline](../../../../samples/snippets/xml/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria custom feeds/xml/iqueryablefeedresultinline.xml#iqueryablefeedresultinline)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Reflection Provider](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/reflection-provider-wcf-data-services.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,292],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"WCF Data Services, customizing\"\n  - \"WCF Data Services, customizing feeds\"\nms.assetid: 00c23dcf-9bb8-459a-a012-6c4d9bcad7e9","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,72],"content":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","pos":[0,72]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[299,371],"content":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","linkify":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Customize Feeds with the Reflection Provider (WCF Data Services)","pos":[0,72]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)]</ph> enables you to customize the Atom serialization in a data service response so that properties of an entity may be mapped to unused elements that are defined in the AtomPub protocol.","pos":[372,613],"source":"[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] enables you to customize the Atom serialization in a data service response so that properties of an entity may be mapped to unused elements that are defined in the AtomPub protocol."},{"content":"This topic shows how to define mapping attributes for the entity types in a data model that is defined by using the reflection provider.","pos":[614,750]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Feed Customization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/feed-customization-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>.","pos":[751,875],"source":" For more information, see [Feed Customization](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/feed-customization-wcf-data-services.md)."},{"pos":[882,1088],"content":"The data model for this example is defined in the topic <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Create a Data Service Using the Reflection Provider<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-rp-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>","source":"The data model for this example is defined in the topic [How to: Create a Data Service Using the Reflection Provider](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/create-a-data-service-using-rp-wcf-data-services.md)"},{"pos":[1097,1104],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"In the following example, both properties of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Order`</ph> type are mapped to existing Atom elements.","pos":[1108,1207],"source":"In the following example, both properties of the `Order` type are mapped to existing Atom elements."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`Product`</ph> property of the <ph id=\"ph2\">`Item`</ph> type is mapped to a custom feed attribute in a separate namespace.","pos":[1208,1311],"source":" The `Product` property of the `Item` type is mapped to a custom feed attribute in a separate namespace."},{"pos":[1682,1689],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1693,1813],"content":"The previous example returns the following result for the URI <ph id=\"ph1\">`http://myservice/OrderItems.svc/Orders(0)?$expand=Items`</ph>.","source":"The previous example returns the following result for the URI `http://myservice/OrderItems.svc/Orders(0)?$expand=Items`."},{"pos":[2023,2031],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2035,2134],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Reflection Provider<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/reflection-provider-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>","source":"[Reflection Provider](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/reflection-provider-wcf-data-services.md)"}]}
