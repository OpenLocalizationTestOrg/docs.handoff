Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.  \n  \n A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class. However, the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword was not used. This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS0108:  \n\n```csharp\n// CS0108.cs  \n// compile with: /W:2  \nusing System;  \n  \nnamespace x  \n{  \n   public class clx  \n   {  \n      public int i = 1;  \n   }  \n  \n   public class cly : clx  \n   {  \n      public static int i = 2;   // CS0108, use the new keyword  \n      // Use the following line instead:  \n      // public static new int i = 2;  \n  \n      public static void Main()  \n      {  \n         Console.WriteLine(i);  \n      }  \n   }  \n}  \n```\n\n## See also\n\n- [new Modifier](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md)\n- [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,177],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0108\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0108\"\nms.assetid: 04330ed2-80d5-4bf2-b0c1-a0c2bec03074","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[184,217],"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","linkify":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Warning (level 2) CS0108","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'.","pos":[219,262]},{"content":"Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.","pos":[263,306]},{"content":"A variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class.","pos":[313,386]},{"content":"However, the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)</ept> keyword was not used.","pos":[387,479],"source":" However, the [new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md) keyword was not used."},{"content":"This warning informs you that you should use <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>; the variable is declared as if <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>new<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> had been used in the declaration.","pos":[480,606],"source":" This warning informs you that you should use **new**; the variable is declared as if **new** had been used in the declaration."},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0108:","pos":[613,651]},{"pos":[1099,1107],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1111,1186],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new Modifier<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md)</ept>","source":"[new Modifier](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new-modifier.md)"},{"pos":[1189,1246],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>new<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)</ept>","source":"[new](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/new.md)"}]}
