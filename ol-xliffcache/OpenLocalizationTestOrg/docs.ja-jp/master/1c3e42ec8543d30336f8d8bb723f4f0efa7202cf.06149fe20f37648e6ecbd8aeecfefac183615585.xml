The CLR makes no guarantee that the task will be put in a state where it can yield processing time.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n An `ICLRTask` is the representation of a task for the CLR. At any point during code execution, a task can be described either as running or waiting to run. The host calls the `ICLRTask::SwitchIn` method to notify the CLR that the task that the current `ICLRTask` instance represents is now in an operable state. After a call to `ICLRTask::SwitchIn`, the host can schedule the task on any operating system thread, except in cases where the runtime requires thread-affinity, as specified by calls to the [IHostTaskManager::BeginThreadAffinity](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-beginthreadaffinity-method.md) and [IHostTaskManager::EndThreadAffinity](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-endthreadaffinity-method.md) methods. Some time later, the operating system might decide to remove the task from the thread and place it in a non-running state. For example, this might happen whenever the task blocks on synchronization primitives, or waits for I/O operations to complete. The host calls [SwitchOut](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-switchout-method.md) to notify the CLR that the task represented by the current `ICLRTask` instance is no longer in an operable state.  \n  \n A task typically terminates at the end of code execution. At that time, the host calls `ICLRTask::ExitTask` to destroy the associated `ICLRTask`. However, tasks can also be recycled by using a call to `ICLRTask::Reset`, which allows the `ICLRTask` instance to be used again. This approach prevents the overhead of repeatedly creating and destroying instances.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System
