The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property is a property of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> base element, and is thus inherited by a variety of controls and other elements.  \n  \n This example is written in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], with a code-behind file that the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] refers to. The code-behind is shown in both a C# and a Microsoft Visual Basic version.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-xaml[FEMarginProgrammatic#XAML](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FEMarginProgrammatic/CSharp/default.xaml#xaml)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[FEMarginProgrammatic#Handler](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FEMarginProgrammatic/CSharp/default.xaml.cs#handler)]\n [!code-vb[FEMarginProgrammatic#Handler](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/FEMarginProgrammatic/VisualBasic/default.xaml.vb#handler)]\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,298],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"setting [WPF], Margin property\"\n  - \"properties [WPF], Margin property\"\n  - \"Margin property [WPF], setting\"\nms.assetid: 70ebee01-6f87-4352-8dd4-402c65eaaed6","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[305,349],"content":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","linkify":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set Margins of Elements and Controls","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"This example describes how to set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A&gt;</ph> property, by changing any existing property value for the margin in code-behind.","pos":[350,517],"source":"This example describes how to set the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property, by changing any existing property value for the margin in code-behind."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A&gt;</ph> property is a property of the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement&gt;</ph> base element, and is thus inherited by a variety of controls and other elements.","pos":[518,720],"source":" The <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Margin%2A> property is a property of the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> base element, and is thus inherited by a variety of controls and other elements."},{"content":"This example is written in <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph>, with a code-behind file that the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> refers to.","pos":[727,940],"source":"This example is written in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)], with a code-behind file that the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] refers to."},{"content":"The code-behind is shown in both a C# and a Microsoft Visual Basic version.","pos":[941,1016]},{"pos":[1025,1032],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]}]}
