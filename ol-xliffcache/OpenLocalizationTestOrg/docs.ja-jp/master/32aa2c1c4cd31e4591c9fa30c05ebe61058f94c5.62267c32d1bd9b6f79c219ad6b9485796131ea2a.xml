This type of application is called a Windows service. With framework features, you can create services, install them, and start, stop, and otherwise control their behavior.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In Visual Studio you can create a service in managed code in Visual C# or Visual Basic, which can interoperate with existing C++ code if required. Or, you can create a Windows service in native C++ by using the [ATL Project Wizard](/cpp/atl/reference/atl-project-wizard).\n\n## In this section\n\n[Introduction to Windows Service Applications](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/introduction-to-windows-service-applications.md)\n\nProvides an overview of Windows service applications, the lifetime of a service, and how service applications differ from other common project types.\n\n[Walkthrough: Creating a Windows Service Application in the Component Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/walkthrough-creating-a-windows-service-application-in-the-component-designer.md)\n\nProvides an example of creating a service in Visual Basic and Visual C#.\n\n[Service Application Programming Architecture](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/service-application-programming-architecture.md)\n\nExplains the language elements used in service programming.\n\n[How to: Create Windows Services](../../../docs/framework/windows-services/how-to-create-windows-services.md)\n\nDescribes the process of creating and configuring Windows services using the Windows service project template.\n\n## Related sections\n\n<xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> - Describes the major features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase> class, which is used to create services.\n\n<xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> - Describes the features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> class, which is used along with the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> class to install and uninstall your services.\n\n<xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> - Describes the features of the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceInstaller> class, which is used along with the <xref:System.ServiceProcess.ServiceProcessInstaller> class to install and uninstall your service.\n\n[Create Projects from Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2013/0fyc0azh(v=vs.120)) -  Describes the projects types used in this chapter and how to choose between them.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,459],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Developing Windows Service Applications\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"ServiceInstaller class, Windows Service applications\"\n  - \"Service class, Windows Service applications\"\n  - \"Windows Service applications\"\n  - \"Windows NT services\"\n  - \"ServiceProcessInstaller class, Windows Service applications\"\n  - \"services\"\n  - \".NET applications, Windows applications\"\nms.assetid: ba72d648-9553-4849-b829-069ad5ea014b\nauthor: \"ghogen\"","nodes":[{"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications","nodes":[{"pos":[0,39],"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications","nodes":[{"content":"Developing Windows Service Applications","pos":[0,39]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[466,494],"content":"Develop Windows service apps","linkify":"Develop Windows service apps","nodes":[{"content":"Develop Windows service apps","pos":[0,28]}]},{"content":"Using Visual Studio or the .NET Framework SDK, you can easily create services by creating an application that is installed as a service.","pos":[496,632]},{"content":"This type of application is called a Windows service.","pos":[633,686]},{"content":"With framework features, you can create services, install them, and start, stop, and otherwise control their behavior.","pos":[687,805]},{"pos":[809,1090],"content":"[!NOTE]\nIn Visual Studio you can create a service in managed code in Visual C# or Visual Basic, which can interoperate with existing C++ code if required.
