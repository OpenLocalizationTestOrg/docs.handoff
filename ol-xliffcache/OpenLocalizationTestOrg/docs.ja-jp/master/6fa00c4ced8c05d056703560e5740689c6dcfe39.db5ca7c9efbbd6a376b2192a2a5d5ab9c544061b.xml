By default, [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis70](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis70-md.md)] is configured with these [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types, but [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] are not.\n\nThis topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] to deploy [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winclient](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winclient-md.md)] applications.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You can check the *UserAgent* string in the registry to determine whether a system has .NET Framework installed. For details and a script that examines the *UserAgent* string to determine whether .NET Framework is installed on a system, see [Detect Whether the .NET Framework 3.0 Is Installed](how-to-detect-whether-the-net-framework-3-0-is-installed.md).\n\n<a name=\"content_expiration\"></a>\n\n## Adjust the Content Expiration Setting\n\nYou should adjust the content expiration setting to 1 minute. The following procedure outlines how to do this with [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)].\n\n1. Click the **Start** menu, point to **Administrative Tools**, and click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**. You can also launch this application from the command line with \"%SystemRoot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\iis.msc\".\n\n2. Expand the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)] tree until you find the **Default Web site** node.\n\n3. Right-click **Default Web site** and select **Properties** from the context menu.\n\n4. Select the **HTTP Headers** tab and click \"Enable Content Expiration\".\n\n5. Set the content to expire after 1 minute.\n\n<a name=\"register_mime_types\"></a>\n\n## Register MIME Types and File Extensions\n\nYou must register several [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types and file extensions so that the browser on the client's system can load the correct handler. You need to add the following types:\n\n|Extension|MIME Type|\n|---------------|---------------|\n|.manifest|application/manifest|\n|.xaml|application/xaml+xml|\n|.application|application/x-ms-application|\n|.xbap|application/x-ms-xbap|\n|.deploy|application/octet-stream|\n|.xps|application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument|\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You do not need to register [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types or file extensions on client systems. They are registered automatically when you install Microsoft .NET Framework.\n\nThe following Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) sample automatically adds the necessary [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types to [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_iis5](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-iis5-md.md)]. To use the script, copy the code to a .vbs file on your server. Then, run the script by running the file from the command line or double-clicking the file in [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_winexpl](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-winexpl-md.md)].\n\n```vb\n' This script adds the necessary Windows Presentation Foundation MIME types\n' to an IIS Server.\n' To use this script, just double-click or execute it from a command line.\n' Running this script multiple times results in multiple entries in the IIS MimeMap.\n\nDim MimeMapObj, MimeMapArray, MimeTypesToAddArray, WshShell, oExec\nConst ADS_PROPERTY_UPDATE = 2\n\n' Set the MIME types to be added\nMimeTypesToAddArray = Array(\".manifest\", \"application/manifest\", \".xaml\", _\n    \"application/xaml+xml\", \".application\", \"application/x-ms-application\", _\n    \".deploy\", \"application/octet-stream\", \".xbap\", \"application/x-ms-xbap\", _\n    \".xps\", \"application/vnd.ms-xpsdocument\")\n\n' Get the MimeMap object\nSet MimeMapObj = GetObject(\"IIS://LocalHost/MimeMap\")\n\n' Call AddMimeType for every pair of extension/MIME type\nFor counter = 0 to UBound(MimeTypesToAddArray) Step 2\n    AddMimeType MimeTypesToAddArray(counter), MimeTypesToAddArray(counter+1)\nNext\n\n' Create a Shell object\nSet WshShell = CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\")\n\n' Stop and Start the IIS Service\nSet oExec = WshShell.Exec(\"net stop w3svc\")\nDo While oExec.Status = 0\n    WScript.Sleep 100\nLoop\n\nSet oExec = WshShell.Exec(\"net start w3svc\")\nDo While oExec.Status = 0\n    WScript.Sleep 100\nLoop\n\nSet oExec = Nothing\n\n' Report status to user\nWScript.Echo \"Windows Presentation Foundation MIME types have been registered.\"\n\n' AddMimeType Sub\nSub AddMimeType (Ext, MType)\n\n    ' Get the mappings from the MimeMap property.\n    MimeMapArray = MimeMapObj.GetEx(\"MimeMap\")\n\n    ' Add a new mapping.\n    i = UBound(MimeMapArray) + 1\n    ReDim Preserve MimeMapArray(i)\n    Set MimeMapArray(i) = CreateObject(\"MimeMap\")\n    MimeMapArray(i).Extension = Ext\n    MimeMapArray(i).MimeType = MType\n    MimeMapObj.PutEx ADS_PROPERTY_UPDATE, \"MimeMap\", MimeMapArray\n    MimeMapObj.SetInfo\n\nEnd Sub\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Running this script multiple times creates multiple [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] map entries in the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] metabase.\n\nAfter you have run this script, you may not see additional [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_mime](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-mime-md.md)] types from the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis50](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis50-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_iis60](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-iis60-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_mmc](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-mmc-md.md)].
