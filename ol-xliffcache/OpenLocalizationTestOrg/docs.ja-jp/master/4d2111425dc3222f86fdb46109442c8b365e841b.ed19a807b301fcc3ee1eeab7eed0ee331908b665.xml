All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \nexpression INTERSECT expression  \n```  \n  \n## Arguments  \n `expression`  \n Any valid query expression that returns a collection to compare with the collection returned from another query expression.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n INTERSECT is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators. All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right. For precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators, see [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following Entity SQL query uses the INTERSECT operator to return a collection of any distinct values that are returned by both the query expressions on the left and right sides of the INTERSECT operand. The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model. To compile and run this query, follow these steps:  \n  \n1.  Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md).  \n  \n2.  Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[DP EntityServices Concepts 2#INTERSECT](../../../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Data/dp entityservices concepts 2/cs/entitysql.cs#intersect)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,106],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 93c6fe33-f341-4b52-911e-adf503891951","nodes":[{"content":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[113,135],"content":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","linkify":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","nodes":[{"content":"INTERSECT (Entity SQL)","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Returns a collection of any distinct values that are returned by both the query expressions on the left and right sides of the INTERSECT operand.","pos":[136,281]},{"content":"All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as <ph id=\"ph1\">`expression`</ph>.","pos":[282,375],"source":" All expressions must be of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`."},{"pos":[384,390],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[448,457],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Any valid query expression that returns a collection to compare with the collection returned from another query expression.","pos":[477,600]},{"pos":[609,621],"content":"Return Value","linkify":"Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Return Value","pos":[0,12]}]},{"pos":[625,707],"content":"A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as <ph id=\"ph1\">`expression`</ph>.","source":"A collection of the same type or of a common base or derived type as `expression`."},{"pos":[716,723],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"INTERSECT is one of the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators.","pos":[727,821],"source":"INTERSECT is one of the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators."},{"content":"All <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators are evaluated from left to right.","pos":[822,929],"source":" All [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators are evaluated from left to right."},{"content":"For precedence information for the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)]</ph> set operators, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>EXCEPT<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md)</ept>.","pos":[930,1138],"source":" For precedence information for the [!INCLUDE[esql](../../../../../../includes/esql-md.md)] set operators, see [EXCEPT](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/except-entity-sql.md)."},{"pos":[1147,1154],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following Entity SQL query uses the INTERSECT operator to return a collection of any distinct values that are returned by both the query expressions on the left and right sides of the INTERSECT operand.","pos":[1158,1364]},{"content":"The query is based on the AdventureWorks Sales Model.","pos":[1365,1418]},{"content":"To compile and run this query, follow these steps:","pos":[1419,1469]},{"pos":[1479,1676],"content":"Follow the procedure in <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md)</ept>.","source":"Follow the procedure in [How to: Execute a Query that Returns StructuralType Results](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/how-to-execute-a-query-that-returns-structuraltype-results.md)."},{"pos":[1686,1769],"content":"Pass the following query as an argument to the <ph id=\"ph1\">`ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery`</ph> method:","source":"Pass the following query as an argument to the `ExecuteStructuralTypeQuery` method:"},{"pos":[1954,1962],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1966,2080],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Entity SQL Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)</ept>","source":"[Entity SQL Reference](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/entity-sql-reference.md)"}]}
