If the declaration is a `Const` statement, check to make sure the constant is initialized with a literal, a previously declared constant, an enumeration member, or a combination of literals, constants, and enumeration members combined with operators.  \n  \n2.  If the declaration specifies an array, check to see if a variable is being used to specify the number of elements.
