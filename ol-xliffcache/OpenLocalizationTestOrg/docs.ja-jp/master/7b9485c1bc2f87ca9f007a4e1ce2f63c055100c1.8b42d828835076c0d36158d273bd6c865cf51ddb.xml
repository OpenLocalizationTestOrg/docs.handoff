Language functionality that is present only in the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] is disabled.  \n  \n The `-netcf` option is designed to be used with [-sdkpath](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sdkpath.md). The language features disabled by `-netcf` are the same language features not present in the files targeted with `-sdkpath`.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The `-netcf` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line. The `-netcf` option is set when a Visual Basic device project is loaded.  \n  \n The `-netcf` option changes the following language features:  \n  \n-   The [End \\<keyword> Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/end-keyword-statement.md) keyword, which terminates execution of a program, is disabled. The following program compiles and runs without `-netcf` but fails at compile time with `-netcf`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#34](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/netcf.vb#34)]  \n  \n-   Late binding, in all forms, is disabled. Compile-time errors are generated when recognized late-binding scenarios are encountered. The following program compiles and runs without `-netcf` but fails at compile time with `-netcf`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#35](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/OptionStrictOff.vb#35)]  \n  \n-   The [Auto](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/auto.md), [Ansi](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/ansi.md), and [Unicode](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/unicode.md) modifiers are disabled. The syntax of the [Declare Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/declare-statement.md) statement is also modified to `Declare Sub|Function name Lib \"library\" [Alias \"alias\"] [([arglist])]`. The following code shows the effect of `-netcf` on a compilation.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrCompiler#36](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrCompiler/VB/OptionStrictOff.vb#36)]  \n  \n-   Using Visual Basic 6.0 keywords that were removed from Visual Basic generates a different error when `-netcf` is used. This affects the error messages for the following keywords:  \n  \n    -   `Open`  \n  \n    -   `Close`  \n  \n    -   `Put`  \n  \n    -   `Print`  \n  \n    -   `Write`  \n  \n    -   `Input`  \n  \n    -   `Lock`  \n  \n    -   `Unlock`  \n  \n    -   `Seek`  \n  \n    -   `Width`  \n  \n    -   `Name`  \n  \n    -   `FreeFile`  \n  \n    -   `EOF`  \n  \n    -   `Loc`  \n  \n    -   `LOF`  \n  \n    -   `Line`  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code compiles `Myfile.vb` with the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)], using the versions of mscorlib.dll and Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll found in the default installation directory of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)] on the C drive. Typically, you would use the most recent version of the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)].  \n  \n```console  \nvbc -netcf -sdkpath:\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\\CompactFrameworkSDK\\v1.0.5000\\Windows CE \" myfile.vb  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/index.md)\n- [Sample Compilation Command Lines](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sample-compilation-command-lines.md)\n- [-sdkpath](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sdkpath.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,281],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"-netcf\"\nms.date: 03/13/2018\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"/netcf\"\n  - \"-netcf\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"-netcf compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"netcf compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\n  - \"/netcf compiler option [Visual Basic]\"\nms.assetid: db7cfa59-c315-401c-a59b-0daf355343d6","nodes":[{"content":"-netcf","nodes":[{"pos":[0,6],"content":"-netcf","nodes":[{"content":"-netcf","pos":[0,6]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[288,294],"content":"-netcf","linkify":"-netcf","nodes":[{"content":"-netcf","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[295,373],"content":"Sets the compiler to target the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)]</ph>.","source":"Sets the compiler to target the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)]."},{"pos":[382,388],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[421,428],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-netcf`</ph> option causes the Visual Basic compiler to target the <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)]</ph> rather than the full <ph id=\"ph3\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph>.","pos":[432,620],"source":"The `-netcf` option causes the Visual Basic compiler to target the [!INCLUDE[Compact](~/includes/compact-md.md)] rather than the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]."},{"content":"Language functionality that is present only in the full <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]</ph> is disabled.","pos":[621,743],"source":" Language functionality that is present only in the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](~/includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] is disabled."},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`-netcf`</ph> option is designed to be used with <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>-sdkpath<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sdkpath.md)</ept>.","pos":[750,875],"source":"The `-netcf` option is designed to be used with [-sdkpath](../../../visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/sdkpath.md)."},{"content":"The language features disabled by <ph id=\"ph1\">`-netcf`</ph> are the same language features not present in the files targeted with <ph id=\"ph2\">`-sdkpath`</ph>.","pos":[876,1000],"source":" The language features disabled by `-netcf` are the same language features not present in the files targeted with `-sdkpath`."},{"pos":[1008,1242],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The `-netcf` option is not available from within the Visual Studio development environment; it is available only when compiling from the command line.
