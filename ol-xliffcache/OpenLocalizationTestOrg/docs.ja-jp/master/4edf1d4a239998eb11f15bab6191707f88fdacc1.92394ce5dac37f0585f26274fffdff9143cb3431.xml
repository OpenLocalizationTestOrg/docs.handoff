background information that will help you understand and use Visual Basic and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Writing Your First LINQ Query](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/writing-your-first-linq-query.md)  \n Describes the three stages in writing a basic LINQ query: obtaining the data source, writing the query, and executing the query.  \n  \n [Basic Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/basic-query-operations.md)  \n Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in Visual Basic.  \n  \n [Visual Basic Features That Support LINQ](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/features-that-support-linq.md)  \n Describes the Visual Basic language features that support LINQ, such as anonymous types and type inference.  \n  \n [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/type-relationships-in-query-operations.md)  \n Describes how data types are preserved or transformed when queries are written and executed.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/walkthrough-writing-queries.md)  \n Step-by-step instructions for creating a Visual Basic LINQ project, adding a simple data source, and performing some basic query operations.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)  \n Includes an overview of queries in LINQ and provides links to additional resources.  \n  \n [Overview of LINQ to XML in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/xml/overview-of-linq-to-xml.md)  \n Describes how Visual Basic supports LINQ to XML.  \n  \n [LINQ to DataSet Overview](../../../../framework/data/adonet/linq-to-dataset-overview.md)  \n Provides a conceptual overview of LINQ to DataSet.  \n  \n [LINQ to SQL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb386976)  \n Explains the LINQ to SQL technology and provides links to topics that help you use LINQ to SQL.  \n  \n [Visual Studio IDE and Tools Support for LINQ (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/visual-studio-ide-and-tools-support-for-linq.md)  \n Describes tools that are available in the Visual Studio environment for designing, coding, and debugging LINQ-enabled applications.  \n  \n [LINQ to Objects (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-objects.md)  \n Includes a selection of How-to topics for using LINQ with in-memory collections.  \n  \n [LINQ to XML (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-xml.md)  \n Includes links to topics that explain how to use LINQ to XML, which provides the in-memory document modification capabilities of the Document Object Model (DOM), and supports LINQ query expressions.  \n  \n [Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)  \n Provides links to topics that explain the LINQ technologies.  \n  \n [Getting Started with LINQ in
