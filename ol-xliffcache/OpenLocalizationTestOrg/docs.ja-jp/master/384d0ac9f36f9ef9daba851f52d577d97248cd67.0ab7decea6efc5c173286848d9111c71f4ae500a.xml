If you prefer to follow the tutorial using a pre-built solution, [view or download the sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-with-fsharp-nunit/) before you begin. For download instructions, see [Samples and Tutorials](../../samples-and-tutorials/index.md#viewing-and-downloading-samples).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) or later versions.\n- A text editor or code editor of your choice.\n\n## Creating the source project\n\nOpen a shell window. Create a directory called *unit-testing-with-fsharp* to hold the solution.\nInside this new directory, run the following command to create a new solution file for the class library and the test project:\n\n```console\ndotnet new sln\n```\n\nNext, create a *MathService* directory. The following outline shows the directory and file structure so far:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-with-fsharp\n    unit-testing-with-fsharp.sln\n    /MathService\n```\n\nMake *MathService* the current directory and run the following command to create the source project:\n\n```console\ndotnet new classlib -lang F#\n```\n\nYou create a failing implementation of the math service:\n\n```fsharp\nmodule MyMath =\n    let squaresOfOdds xs = raise (System.NotImplementedException(\"You haven't written a test yet!\"))\n```\n\nChange the directory back to the *unit-testing-with-fsharp* directory. Run the following command to add the class library project to the solution:\n\n```console\ndotnet sln add .\\MathService\\MathService.fsproj\n```\n\n## Creating the test project\n\nNext, create the *MathService.Tests* directory. The following outline shows the directory structure:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-with-fsharp\n    unit-testing-with-fsharp.sln\n    /MathService\n        Source Files\n        MathService.fsproj\n    /MathService.Tests\n```\n\nMake the *MathService.Tests* directory the current directory and create a new project using the following command:\n\n```console\ndotnet new nunit -lang F#\n```\n\nThis creates a test project that uses NUnit as the test framework. The generated template configures the test runner in the *MathServiceTests.fsproj*:\n\n```xml\n<ItemGroup>\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"15.5.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit\" Version=\"3.9.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit3TestAdapter\" Version=\"3.9.0\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nThe test project requires other packages to create and run unit tests. `dotnet new` in the previous step added NUnit and the NUnit test adapter. Now, add the `MathService` class library as another dependency to the project. Use the [`dotnet add reference`](../tools/dotnet-add-reference.md) command:\n\n```console\ndotnet add reference ../MathService/MathService.fsproj\n```\n\nYou can see the entire file in the [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/master/core/getting-started/unit-testing-with-fsharp/MathService.Tests/MathService.Tests.fsproj) on GitHub.\n\nYou have the following final solution layout:\n\n```\n/unit-testing-with-fsharp\n    unit-testing-with-fsharp.sln\n    /MathService\n        Source Files\n        MathService.fsproj\n    /MathService.Tests\n        Test Source Files\n        MathService.Tests.fsproj\n```\n\nExecute the following command in the *unit-testing-with-fsharp* directory:\n\n```console\ndotnet sln add .\\MathService.Tests\\MathService.Tests.fsproj\n```\n\n## Creating the first test\n\nYou write one failing test, make it pass, then repeat the process. Open *UnitTest1.fs* and add the following code:\n\n```fsharp\nnamespace MathService.Tests\n\nopen System\nopen NUnit.Framework\nopen MathService\n\n[<TestFixture>]\ntype TestClass () =\n\n    [<Test>]\n    member this.TestMethodPassing() =\n        Assert.True(true)\n\n    [<Test>]\n     member this.FailEveryTime() = Assert.True(false)\n```\n\nThe `[<TestFixture>]` attribute denotes a class that contains tests. The `[<Test>]` attribute denotes a test method that is run by the test runner. From the *unit-testing-with-fsharp* directory, execute [`dotnet test`](../tools/dotnet-test.md) to build the tests and the class library and then run the tests. The NUnit test runner contains the program entry point to run your tests. `dotnet test` starts the test runner using the unit test project you've created.\n\nThese two tests show the most basic passing and failing tests. `My test` passes, and `Fail every time` fails. Now, create a test for the `squaresOfOdds` method. The `squaresOfOdds` method returns a sequence of the squares of all odd integer values that are part of the input sequence. Rather than trying to write all of those functions at once, you can iteratively create tests that validate the functionality. Making each test pass means creating the necessary functionality for the method.\n\nThe simplest test we can write is to call `squaresOfOdds` with all even numbers, where the result should be an empty sequence of integers.  Here's that test:\n\n```fsharp\n[<Test>]\nmember this.TestEvenSequence() =\n    let expected = Seq.empty<int>\n    let actual = MyMath.squaresOfOdds [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]\n    Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))\n```\n\nNotice that the `expected` sequence has been converted to a list. The NUnit framework relies on many standard .NET types. That dependency means that your public interface and expected results support <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> rather than <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable>.\n\nWhen you run the test, you see that your test fails. You haven't created the implementation yet. Make this test pass by writing the simplest code in the *Library.fs* class in your MathService project that works:\n\n```csharp\nlet squaresOfOdds xs =\n    Seq.empty<int>\n```\n\nIn the *unit-testing-with-fsharp* directory, run `dotnet test` again. The `dotnet test` command runs a build for the `MathService` project and then for the `MathService.Tests` project. After building both projects, it runs your tests. Two tests pass now.\n\n## Completing the requirements\n\nNow that you've made one test pass, it's time to write more. The next simple case works with a sequence whose only odd number is `1`. The number 1 is easier because the square of 1 is 1. Here's that next test:\n\n```fsharp\n[<Test>]\nmember public this.TestOnesAndEvens() =\n    let expected = [1; 1; 1; 1]\n    let actual = MyMath.squaresOfOdds [2; 1; 4; 1; 6; 1; 8; 1; 10]\n    Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))\n```\n\nExecuting `dotnet test` fails the new test. You must update the `squaresOfOdds` method to handle this new test. You must filter all the even numbers out of the sequence to make this test pass. You can do that by writing a small filter function and using `Seq.filter`:\n\n```fsharp\nlet private isOdd x = x % 2 <> 0\n\nlet squaresOfOdds xs =\n    xs\n    |> Seq.filter isOdd\n```\n\nNotice the call to `Seq.toList`. That creates a list, which implements the <xref:System.Collections.ICollection> interface.\n\nThere's one more step to go: square each of the odd numbers. Start by writing a new test:\n\n```fsharp\n[<Test>]\nmember public this.TestSquaresOfOdds() =\n    let expected = [1; 9; 25; 49; 81]\n    let actual = MyMath.squaresOfOdds [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]\n    Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected))\n```\n\nYou can fix the test by piping the filtered sequence through a map operation to compute the square of each odd number:\n\n```fsharp\nlet private square x = x * x\nlet private isOdd x = x % 2 <> 0\n\nlet squaresOfOdds xs =\n    xs\n    |> Seq.filter isOdd\n    |> Seq.map square\n```\n\nYou've built a small library and a set of unit tests for that library. You've structured the solution so that adding new packages and tests is part of the normal workflow. You've concentrated most of your time and effort on solving the goals of the application.","nodes":[{"pos":[4,310],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: Unit testing F# in .NET Core
