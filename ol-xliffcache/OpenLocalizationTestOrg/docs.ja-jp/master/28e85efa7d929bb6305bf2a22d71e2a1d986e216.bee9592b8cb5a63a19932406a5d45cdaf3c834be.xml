This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the `PrintPreviewControl` only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface. If you want the standard user interface, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PrintPreviewControl Control Overview](printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintPreviewControl`, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewControl>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [PrintPreviewDialog Control](printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)  \n Describes an alternate way to create print preview functionality.  \n  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,361],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"printing [Windows Forms], print preview\"\n  - \"PrintPreviewControl control (using designer)\"\n  - \"PrintPreview control (using designer)\"\n  - \"print preview [Windows Forms], custom interface (using designer)\"\nms.assetid: 3fdb2e46-92a3-4e26-bb8d-63a89087b337","nodes":[{"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[368,411],"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintPreviewControl Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph> is used to display a document as it will appear when printed.","pos":[412,513],"source":"The Windows Forms `PrintPreviewControl` is used to display a document as it will appear when printed."},{"content":"This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph> only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface.","pos":[514,687],"source":" This control has no buttons or other user interface elements, so typically you use the `PrintPreviewControl` only if you wish to write your own print-preview user interface."},{"content":"If you want the standard user interface, use a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[688,790],"source":" If you want the standard user interface, use a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintPreviewDialog> control."},{"pos":[799,814],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintPreviewControl Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[818,911],"source":"[PrintPreviewControl Control Overview](printpreviewcontrol-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Introduces the general concepts of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintPreviewControl`</ph>, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component.","pos":[915,1048],"source":"Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintPreviewControl`, which you can use to design your own print preview dialog or component."},{"pos":[1057,1066],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Provides reference information on the class and its members.","pos":[1121,1181]},{"pos":[1190,1206],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintPreviewDialog Control<ept id=\"p1\">](printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1210,1283],"source":"[PrintPreviewDialog Control](printpreviewdialog-control-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Describes an alternate way to create print preview functionality.","pos":[1287,1352]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1359,1430],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1434,1525]}]}
