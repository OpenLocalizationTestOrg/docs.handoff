become a proficient Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) programmer.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Designing Workflows](designing-workflows.md)  \n Topics that describe the flow-control paradigms used in workflow development.  \n  \n [Using and Creating Activities](using-and-creating-activities.md)  \n Topics that describes the system-provided activities available in Windows Workflow Foundation (WF).  \n  \n [Windows Workflow Foundation Data Model](data-model.md)  \n Topics that describe variables, arguments and expressions in [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../includes/wf1-md.md)].  \n  \n [Waiting for Input in a Workflow](waiting-for-input-in-a-workflow.md)  \n Topics that describes how to use bookmarks and messaging activities.  \n  \n [Exceptions, Transactions, and Compensation](exceptions-transactions-and-compensation.md)  \n Topics that describe how to use exception handlers, transactions, and compensation to handle run-time errors.  \n  \n [Hosting Workflows](hosting-workflows.md)  \n Topics that describe the details for writing workflow host applications.  \n  \n [Dynamic Update](dynamic-update.md)  \n Describes how to use dynamic update to update the workflow definition of a persisted workflow instance.  \n  \n [Workflow Services](../wcf/feature-details/workflow-services.md)  \n Topics that describe the programming model that supports writing services declaratively.  \n  \n [Workflow Persistence](workflow-persistence.md)  \n Topics that describe the options for automatically or manually persisting workflow data and unloading workflows from memory.  \n  \n [Migration Guidance](migration-guidance.md)  \n Topics that describe how to migrate workflows from previous versions of Windows Workflow Foundation (WF).  \n  \n [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)  \n Topics that describe workflow tracking and tracing and how these features are used for monitoring workflow applications.  \n  \n [Workflow Security](workflow-security.md)  \n Discusses how to keep your workflow secure when using SQL and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).  \n  \n [Windows Workflow Foundation 4 Performance](performance.md)  \n Discusses Windows Workflow Foundation 4 performance and compares it to the previous version of WF.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,247],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Windows Workflow Foundation Programming\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Windows Workflow
