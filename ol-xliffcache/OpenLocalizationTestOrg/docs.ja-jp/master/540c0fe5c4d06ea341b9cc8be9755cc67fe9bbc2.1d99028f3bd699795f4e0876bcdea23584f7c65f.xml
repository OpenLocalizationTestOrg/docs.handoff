Security is not required because the data is of low importance, the network is expected to be inherently secure, or security is provided by a layer below the WCF infrastructure.  \n  \n ![Intranet unsecured client and service scenario.](./media/intranet-unsecured-client-and-service/unsecured-web-client-service.gif)  \n  \n|Characteristic|Description|  \n|--------------------|-----------------|  \n|Security Mode|None|  \n|Transport|TCP|  \n|Binding|<xref:System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding>|  \n|Interoperability|WCF only|  \n|Authentication|None|  \n|Integrity|None|  \n|Confidentiality|None|  \n  \n## Service  \n The following code and configuration are meant to run independently.

Do one of the following:  \n  \n-   Create a stand-alone client using the code (and client code).  \n  \n-   Create a client that does not define any endpoint addresses. Instead, use the client constructor that takes the configuration name as an argument.
