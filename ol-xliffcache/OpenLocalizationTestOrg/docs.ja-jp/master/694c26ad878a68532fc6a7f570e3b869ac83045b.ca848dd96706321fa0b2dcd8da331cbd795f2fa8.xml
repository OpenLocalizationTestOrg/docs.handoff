If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times. Both issues can drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)   \n [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)   \n [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,89],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,77]}]},{"pos":[387,447],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","linkify":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.PrepareMessageRetry","pos":[0,60]}]},{"content":"A prepare message retry was sent to an unresponsive participant.","pos":[448,512]},{"pos":[521,532],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Traced if the local Transaction Manager needed to resend a Prepare message to a subordinate participant because it did not receive a response in a given amount of time.","pos":[536,704]},{"pos":[713,728],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Investigate potential network or product issues that prevent the response from being delivered on time.","pos":[732,835]},{"content":"If many of these messages are seen, it can indicate infrastructure problems or abnormally long response times.","pos":[837,947]},{"content":"Both issues can drastically reduce the throughput of transactions within the system.","pos":[948,1032]},{"pos":[1041,1049],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1053,1127],"source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1130,1285],"source":" [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","pos":[1288,1377],"source":" [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
