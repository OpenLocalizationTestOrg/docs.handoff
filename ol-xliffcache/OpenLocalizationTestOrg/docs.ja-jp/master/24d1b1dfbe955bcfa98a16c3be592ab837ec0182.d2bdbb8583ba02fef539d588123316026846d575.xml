With the managed [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes, you can render high quality antialiased text, as well as lower quality text. Typically, higher quality rendering takes more processing time than lower quality rendering. To set the text quality level, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.TextRenderingHint%2A> property of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> to one of the elements of the <xref:System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint> enumeration  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example draws text with two different quality settings.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.FontsAndText#21](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.FontsAndText/CS/Class1.cs#21)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.FontsAndText#21](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.FontsAndText/VB/Class1.vb#21)]  \n \n The following illustration shows the output of the example code:  \n  \n ![Screenshot that shows text with two different quality settings.](./media/how-to-use-antialiasing-with-text/antialiasing-text-quality-settings.png)  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding code example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,409],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"strings [Windows Forms], smoothing drawn\"\n  - \"antialiasing [Windows Forms], using with text\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], smoothing\"\n  - \"text [Windows Forms], antialiasing\"\n  - \"strings [Windows Forms], antialiasing when drawing\"\nms.assetid: 48fc34f3-f236-4b01-a0cb-f0752e6d22ae","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","nodes":[{"pos":[0,34],"content":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","pos":[0,34]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[416,450],"content":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","linkify":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Antialiasing with Text","pos":[0,34]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Antialiasing<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept> refers to the smoothing of jagged edges of drawn graphics and text to improve their appearance or readability.","pos":[451,576],"source":"*Antialiasing* refers to the smoothing of jagged edges of drawn graphics and text to improve their appearance or readability."},{"content":"With the managed <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)]</ph> classes, you can render high quality antialiased text, as well as lower quality text.","pos":[577,747],"source":" With the managed [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] classes, you can render high quality antialiased text, as well as lower quality text."},{"content":"Typically, higher quality rendering takes more processing time than lower quality rendering.","pos":[748,840]},{"content":"To set the text quality level, set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.TextRenderingHint%2A&gt;</ph> property of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> to one of the elements of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint&gt;</ph> enumeration","pos":[841,1063],"source":" To set the text quality level, set the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.TextRenderingHint%2A> property of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> to one of the elements of the <xref:System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint> enumeration"},{"pos":[1072,1079],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following code example draws text with two different quality settings.","pos":[1083,1157]},{"content":"The following illustration shows the output of the example code:","pos":[1449,1513]},{"content":"Screenshot that shows text with two different quality settings.","pos":[1522,1585]},{"pos":[1677,1695],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1699,1900],"content":"The preceding code example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`e`</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"The preceding code example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1909,1917],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1921,1968],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Fonts and Text<ept id=\"p1\">](using-fonts-and-text.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Fonts and Text](using-fonts-and-text.md)"}]}
