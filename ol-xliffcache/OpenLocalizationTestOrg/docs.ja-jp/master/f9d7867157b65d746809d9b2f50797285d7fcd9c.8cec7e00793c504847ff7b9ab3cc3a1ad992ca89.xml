The linker has reported an error in the pre-emission stage of creating the assembly.  \n  \n This can occur if there are problems with the key file or the key container specified. To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys. To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information. The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed. For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30140  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic [Al.exe](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md). for error AL1019 further explanation and advice  \n  \n2.  If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)\n- [Signing Page, Project Designer](/visualstudio/ide/reference/signing-page-project-designer)\n- [Al.exe](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md)\n- [Talk to Us](/visualstudio/ide/talk-to-us)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,210],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Error creating assembly manifest: <error message>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc30140\"\n  - \"vbc30140\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30140\"\nms.assetid: 1beb5aa0-7b79-4c85-946b-5c2d0a41d1d2","nodes":[{"content":"Error creating assembly manifest: <error message>","nodes":[{"pos":[0,49],"content":"Error creating assembly manifest: <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;error message&gt;</ph>","source":"Error creating assembly manifest: <error message>"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[217,267],"content":"Error creating assembly manifest: \\<error message>","linkify":"Error creating assembly manifest: \\<error message>","nodes":[{"content":"Error creating assembly manifest: <ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>error message&gt;","pos":[0,50],"source":"Error creating assembly manifest: \\<error message>"}]},{"content":"The Visual Basic compiler calls the Assembly Linker (Al.exe, also known as Alink) to generate an assembly with a manifest.","pos":[268,390]},{"content":"The linker has reported an error in the pre-emission stage of creating the assembly.","pos":[391,475]},{"content":"This can occur if there are problems with the key file or the key container specified.","pos":[482,568]},{"content":"To fully sign an assembly, you must provide a valid key file that contains information about the public and private keys.","pos":[569,690]},{"content":"To delay sign an assembly, you must select the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Delay sign only<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information.","pos":[691,856],"source":" To delay sign an assembly, you must select the **Delay sign only** check box and provide a valid key file that contains information about the public key information."},{"content":"The private key is not necessary when an assembly is delay-signed.","pos":[857,923]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>.","pos":[924,1074],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)."},{"pos":[1081,1102],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30140","source":"**Error ID:** BC30140"},{"pos":[1111,1132],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Al.exe<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md)</ept>.","pos":[1142,1258],"source":"Examine the quoted error message and consult the topic [Al.exe](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md)."},{"content":"for error AL1019 further explanation and advice","pos":[1259,1306]},{"content":"If the error persists, gather information about the circumstances and notify Microsoft Product Support Services.","pos":[1316,1428]},{"pos":[1437,1445],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1449,1572],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Sign an Assembly with a Strong Name](../../../framework/app-domains/how-to-sign-an-assembly-with-a-strong-name.md)"},{"pos":[1575,1666],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Signing Page, Project Designer<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/reference/signing-page-project-designer)</ept>","source":"[Signing Page, Project Designer](/visualstudio/ide/reference/signing-page-project-designer)"},{"pos":[1669,1729],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Al.exe<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md)</ept>","source":"[Al.exe](../../../framework/tools/al-exe-assembly-linker.md)"},{"pos":[1732,1774],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Talk to Us<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/ide/talk-to-us)</ept>","source":"[Talk to Us](/visualstudio/ide/talk-to-us)"}]}
