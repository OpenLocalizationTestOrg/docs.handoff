By setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A> property, you can provide context-sensitive operations to the user when they right-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control. By associating a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> component with individual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> items, you can add a customized level of shortcut menu functionality to your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> controls.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.

Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control to your form, and then add nodes to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> as needed. For more information, see [How to: Add and Remove Nodes with the Windows Forms TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-and-remove-nodes-with-the-windows-forms-treeview-control.md).  \n  \n2.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> component to your form, and then add menu items to the shortcut menu that represent node-level operations you wish to make available at run time. For more information, see [How to: Add Menu Items to a ContextMenuStrip](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-menu-items-to-a-contextmenustrip.md).  \n  \n3.  Reopen the **TreeNodeEditor** dialog box for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control, select the node to edit, and set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> property to the shortcut menu that you added.  \n  \n4.  When this property is set, the shortcut menu will be displayed when you right-click the node.  \n  \n     Additionally, you will want to write code to handle the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStripItem.Click> events for these menu items.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [TreeView Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [TreeView Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/treeview-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [ContextMenuStrip Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/contextmenustrip-control.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,546],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,80],"content":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,80]}]}],"pos":[6,89],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"shortcut menus, attaching to TreeNodes\"\n  - \"TreeNode, attaching a shortcut menu using Designer\"\nms.assetid: 8e45e184-1313-4f8f-90ff-2cd5789b2268\ncaps.latest.revision: 9\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","yamlblock":true},{"pos":[553,616],"content":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Attach a Shortcut Menu to a TreeNode Using the Designer","pos":[0,63]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control displays a hierarchy of nodes, similar to the files and folders displayed in the left pane of the Windows Explorer feature in Windows operating systems.","pos":[617,832],"source":"The Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control displays a hierarchy of nodes, similar to the files and folders displayed in the left pane of the Windows Explorer feature in Windows operating systems."},{"content":"By setting the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A&gt;</ph> property, you can provide context-sensitive operations to the user when they right-click the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> control.","pos":[833,1042],"source":" By setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ContextMenuStrip%2A> property, you can provide context-sensitive operations to the user when they right-click the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> control."},{"content":"By associating a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip&gt;</ph> component with individual <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode&gt;</ph> items, you can add a customized level of shortcut menu functionality to your <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView&gt;</ph> controls.","pos":[1043,1291],"source":" By associating a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip> component with individual <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeNode> items, you can add a customized level of shortcut menu functionality to your <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TreeView> controls."},{"pos":[1299,1675],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
