Since ref parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed. To resolve this error, remove the **readonly** keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the readonly field to the function. For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modifed and passing the temporary as a ref argument, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n The following sample generates CS1651:  \n  \n```  \n// CS1651.cs  \npublic struct Inner  \n  {  \n    public int i;  \n  }  \n  \nclass Outer  \n{    \n  public static readonly Inner inner = new Inner();  \n}  \n  \nclass D  \n{  \n   static void f(ref int iref)  \n   {  \n   }  \n  \n   static void Main()  \n   {  \n      f(ref Outer.inner.i);  // CS1651  \n      // Try this instead:  \n      // int tmp = Outer.inner.i;  \n      // f(ref tmp);  \n   }  \n}  \n```","nodes":[{"pos":[12,50],"content":"Compiler Error CS1651 | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1651 | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,38]}]},{"pos":[565,586],"content":"Compiler Error CS1651","linkify":"Compiler Error CS1651","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS1651","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Fields of static readonly field 'identifier' cannot be passed ref or out (except in a static constructor)","pos":[587,692]},{"content":"This error occurs if you pass a variable to a function that is a member of a static readonly field as a ref argument.","pos":[699,816]},{"content":"Since ref parameters may be modified by the function, this is not allowed.","pos":[817,891]},{"content":"To resolve this error, remove the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>readonly<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the readonly field to the function.","pos":[892,1026],"source":" To resolve this error, remove the **readonly** keyword on the field, or do not pass the members of the readonly field to the function."},{"content":"For example, you might try creating a temporary variable which can be modifed and passing the temporary as a ref argument, as shown in the following example.","pos":[1027,1184]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS1651:","pos":[1191,1229]}]}
