Such an interface is called a *derived interface*, and the interface it inherits from is called the *base interface*.  \n  \n It is meaningless for an interface to inherit from itself, because it already possesses all its own members.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30296  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Check the spelling of the interface name in the `Inherits` statement.  \n  \n2.  If you do not intend to inherit from a different interface, remove the `Inherits` statement entirely.  \n  \n3.  Examine the cited message for suggestions.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n- [Interfaces](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,226],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Interface '<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30296\"\n  - \"BC30296\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30296\"\nms.assetid: a5bc1ae2-2083-4e26-b8a4-3c4dd951fd27","nodes":[{"content":"Interface '<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>","nodes":[{"pos":[0,65],"content":"Interface '<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;interfacename&gt;</ph>' cannot inherit from itself: <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;message&gt;</ph>","source":"Interface '<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: <message>"}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[233,300],"content":"Interface '\\<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>","linkify":"Interface '\\<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>","nodes":[{"content":"Interface '<ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>interfacename&gt;' cannot inherit from itself: <ph id=\"ph2\">\\&lt;</ph>message&gt;","pos":[0,67],"source":"Interface '\\<interfacename>' cannot inherit from itself: \\<message>"}]},{"pos":[301,452],"content":"An <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inherits Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md)</ept> in an interface definition specifies its own interface.","source":"An [Inherits Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/inherits-statement.md) in an interface definition specifies its own interface."},{"content":"An interface can inherit from another interface, which provides it with all the members of the interface it inherits from, so it does not have to define those members again.","pos":[459,632]},{"content":"Such an interface is called a <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>derived interface<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>, and the interface it inherits from is called the <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>base interface<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept>.","pos":[633,750],"source":" Such an interface is called a *derived interface*, and the interface it inherits from is called the *base interface*."},{"content":"It is meaningless for an interface to inherit from itself, because it already possesses all its own members.","pos":[757,865]},{"pos":[872,893],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30296","source":"**Error ID:** BC30296"},{"pos":[902,923],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[933,1002],"content":"Check the spelling of the interface name in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Inherits`</ph> statement.","source":"Check the spelling of the interface name in the `Inherits` statement."},{"pos":[1012,1113],"content":"If you do not intend to inherit from a different interface, remove the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Inherits`</ph> statement entirely.","source":"If you do not intend to inherit from a different interface, remove the `Inherits` statement entirely."},{"content":"Examine the cited message for suggestions.","pos":[1123,1165]},{"pos":[1174,1182],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1186,1320],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)</ept>","source":"[Inheritance basics (Visual Basic)](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)"},{"pos":[1323,1411],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Interfaces<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Interfaces](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/interfaces/index.md)"}]}
