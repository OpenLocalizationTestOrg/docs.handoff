Correlation provides the mechanism for this. The topics in this section provide an overview of correlation and how to use it in different workflow service scenarios.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Correlation Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/correlation-overview.md)  \n Provides an overview of the types of correlation available in [!INCLUDE[netfx_current_long](../../../../includes/netfx-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n [Context Exchange](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/context-exchange-correlation.md)  \n Describes context exchange correlation.  \n  \n [Durable Duplex](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/durable-duplex-correlation.md)  \n Describes durable duplex correlation.  \n  \n [Content Based](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/content-based-correlation.md)  \n Describes content-based correlation.  \n  \n [Request-Reply](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/request-reply-correlation.md)  \n Describes request-reply correlation.  \n  \n [Troubleshooting Correlation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/troubleshooting-correlation.md)  \n Provides methods for troubleshooting correlation.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
