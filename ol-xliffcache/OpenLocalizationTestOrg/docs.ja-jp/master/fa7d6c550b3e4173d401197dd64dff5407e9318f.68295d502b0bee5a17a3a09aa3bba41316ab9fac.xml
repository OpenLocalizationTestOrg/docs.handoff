Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.  \n  \n Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC33025  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove this operator definition entirely. It is already predefined.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)\n- [Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)\n- [How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)\n- [How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,217],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc33025\"\n  - \"bc33025\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC33025\"\nms.assetid: 7e13dfa3-2b70-4ca6-a8ec-159131fd2c4c","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","nodes":[{"pos":[0,56],"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","pos":[0,56]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[224,280],"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","linkify":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","nodes":[{"content":"Conversion operators cannot convert to an interface type","pos":[0,56]}]},{"content":"A conversion operator is declared with an interface type as a return type.","pos":[281,355]},{"content":"At compile time, Visual Basic considers a predefined conversion to exist from any reference type to any interface.","pos":[362,476]},{"content":"Such a conversion might fail at run time, but the compiler cannot predict run-time results, so it allows any such conversion to compile.","pos":[477,613]},{"content":"Because the compiler considers this conversion to be already defined, it does not allow you to redefine it.","pos":[620,727]},{"pos":[734,755],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC33025","source":"**Error ID:** BC33025"},{"pos":[764,785],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove this operator definition entirely.","pos":[795,836]},{"content":"It is already predefined.","pos":[837,862]},{"pos":[871,879],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[883,994],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/operator-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[997,1089],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Operator Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)</ept>","source":"[Operator Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/operator-statement.md)"},{"pos":[1092,1216],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define an Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define an Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-an-operator.md)"},{"pos":[1219,1363],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define a Conversion Operator<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Define a Conversion Operator](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-define-a-conversion-operator.md)"}]}
