When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n All asynchronous I/O calls to Windows Platform APIs take a Win32 `OVERLAPPED` object, which provides information such as the file pointer position. To maintain state, applications that make asynchronous I/O calls typically add custom data to the structure. `GetHostOverlappedSize` and [IHostIoCompletionManager::InitializeHostOverlapped](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-initializehostoverlapped-method.md) provide an opportunity for the host to include such custom data.  \n  \n The CLR calls the `GetHostOverlappedSize` method to determine the size of the custom data that the host intends to append to the `OVERLAPPED` object.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  `GetHostOverlappedSize` is called only once. The host's custom data must be the same size for every I/O request.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The size of the `OVERLAPPED` object itself is not included in the value of `pcbSize`.  \n  \n For more information about the `OVERLAPPED` structure, see the Windows Platform documentation.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Threading.NativeOverlapped>   \n [ICLRIoCompletionManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclriocompletionmanager-interface.md)   \n [IHostIoCompletionManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihostiocompletionmanager-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,784],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IHostIoCompletionManager::GetHostOverlappedSize Method | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
