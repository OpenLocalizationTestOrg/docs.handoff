These workflows are typically client workflows but could also be workflow services that are hosted in a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>.  \n  \n By default, in a workflow hosted by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, the cache used by <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Send> messaging activities is shared across all workflow instances in the <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost> (host-level caching). For a client workflow that is not hosted by a <xref:System.ServiceModel.WorkflowServiceHost>, the cache is available only to the workflow instance (instance-level caching). Caching is disabled by default for any send activity in your workflow that has endpoints defined in configuration.  \n  \n For more information about how to change the default cache sharing levels and cache settings for the channel factory and channel cache, see [Changing the Cache Sharing Levels for Send Activities](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/changing-the-cache-sharing-levels-for-send-activities.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n In a hosted workflow service, you can specify the factory cache and channel cache settings in the application configuration file. To do so, add a service behavior that contains the cache settings for the factory and channel cache and add this service behavior to your service. The following example shows the contents of a configuration file that contains the **MyChannelCacheBehavior**  service behavior with the custom factory cache and channel cache settings. This service behavior is added to the service through the **behaviorConfiguarion** attribute.  \n  \n```xml  \n<configuration>    \n  <system.serviceModel>  \n    <!-- List of other config sections here -->   \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"MyChannelCacheBehavior\">  \n          <sendMessageChannelCache allowUnsafeCaching =\"false\" >  \n            <!-- Control only the host level settings -->   \n            <factorySettings maxItemsInCache = \"8\" idleTimeout = \"00:05:00\" leaseTimeout=\"10:00:00\" />  \n            <channelSettings maxItemsInCache = \"32\" idleTimeout = \"00:05:00\" leaseTimeout=\"00:06:00\" />  \n          </sendMessageChannelCache>  \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n    <services>  \n      <service name=\"MyService\" behaviorConfiguration=\"MyChannelCacheBehavior\" />  \n    </services>  \n  </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
