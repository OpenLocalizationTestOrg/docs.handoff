For example, a group of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls may display a choice of package carriers for an order, but only one of the carriers will be used. Therefore only one <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> at a time can be selected, even if it is a part of a functional group.  \n  \n You group radio buttons by drawing them inside a container such as a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> control, or a form. All radio buttons that are added directly to a form become one group. To add separate groups, you must place them inside panels or group boxes. For more information about panels or group boxes, see [Panel Control Overview](panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md) or [GroupBox Control Overview](groupbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md).  \n  \n### To group RadioButton controls as a set to function independently of other sets  \n  \n1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control from the **Windows Forms** tab on the **Toolbox** onto the form.  \n  \n2.  Draw <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> controls on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GroupBox> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control.  \n  \n## See also\n\n-
