Alternatively, you can use <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer> for drawing text on a form. For more information, see [How to: Draw Text with GDI](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cpp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/cpp/form1.cpp#7)]\n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/CS/form1.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos#7](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.ConceptualHowTos/VB/form1.vb#7)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n You cannot call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A> method in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event handler. The drawn content will not be redrawn if the form is resized or obscured by another form. To make your content automatically repaint, you should override the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A> method.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The Arial font is not installed.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawString%2A>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextRenderer.DrawText%2A>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormat.FormatFlags%2A>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.StringFormatFlags>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextFormatFlags>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.OnPaint%2A>   \n [Getting Started with Graphics Programming](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/getting-started-with-graphics-programming.md)   \n [How to: Draw Text with GDI](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-draw-text-with-gdi.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,463],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Text on a Windows Form | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  -
