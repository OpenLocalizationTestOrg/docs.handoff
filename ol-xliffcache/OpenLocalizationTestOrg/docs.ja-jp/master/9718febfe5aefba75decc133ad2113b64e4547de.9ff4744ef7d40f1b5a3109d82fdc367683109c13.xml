If you want to supply a custom manifest, for example to specify a requested execution level of \"highestAvailable\" or \"requireAdministrator,\" use this option to specify the name of the file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This option and the [-win32res (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/win32res-compiler-option.md) option are mutually exclusive. If you try to use both options in the same command line you will get a build error.  \n  \n An application that has no application manifest that specifies a requested execution level will be subject to file/registry virtualization under the User Account Control feature in Windows. For more information, see [User Account Control](/windows/access-protection/user-account-control/user-account-control-overview).  \n  \n Your application will be subject to virtualization if either of these conditions is true:  \n  \n-   You use the **-nowin32manifest** option and you do not provide a manifest in a later build step or as part of a Windows Resource (.res) file by using the **-win32res** option.  \n  \n-   You provide a custom manifest that does not specify a requested execution level.  \n  \n Visual Studio creates a default .manifest file and stores it in the debug and release directories alongside the executable file. You can add a custom manifest by creating one in any text editor and then adding the file to the project. Alternatively, you can right-click the **Project** icon in **Solution Explorer**, click **Add New Item**, and then click **Application Manifest File**. After you have added your new or existing manifest file, it will appear in the **Manifest** drop down list. For more information, see [Application Page, Project Designer (C#)](/visualstudio/ide/reference/application-page-project-designer-csharp).  \n  \n You can provide the application manifest as a custom post-build step or as part of a Win32 resource file by using the [-nowin32manifest (C# Compiler Options)](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/nowin32manifest-compiler-option.md) option. Use that same option if you want your application to be subject to file or registry virtualization on Windows Vista. This will prevent the compiler from creating and embedding a default manifest in the portable executable (PE) file.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows the default manifest that the Visual C# compiler inserts into a PE.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The compiler inserts a standard application name \" MyApplication.app \" into the xml.
