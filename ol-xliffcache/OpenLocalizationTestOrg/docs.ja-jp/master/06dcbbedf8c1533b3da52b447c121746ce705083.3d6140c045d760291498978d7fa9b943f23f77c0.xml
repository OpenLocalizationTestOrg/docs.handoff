To load **DataSet** schema information from an XML document, you can use either the **ReadXmlSchema** or the **InferXmlSchema** method of the **DataSet**. **ReadXmlSchema** allows you to load or infer **DataSet** schema information from the document containing XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema, or an XML document with inline XML Schema. **InferXmlSchema** allows you to infer the schema from the XML document while ignoring certain XML namespaces that you specify.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Table ordering in a **DataSet** might not be preserved when you use Web services or XML serialization to transfer a **DataSet** that was created in-memory by using XSD constructs (such as nested relations). Therefore, the recipient of the **DataSet** should not depend on table ordering in this case. However, table ordering is always preserved if the schema of the **DataSet** being transferred was read from XSD files, instead of being created in-memory.  \n  \n## ReadXmlSchema  \n To load the schema of a **DataSet** from an XML document without loading any data, you can use the **ReadXmlSchema** method of the **DataSet**. **ReadXmlSchema** creates **DataSet** schema defined using XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema.  \n  \n The **ReadXmlSchema** method takes a single argument of a file name, a stream, or an **XmlReader** containing the XML document to be loaded. The XML document can contain only schema, or can contain schema inline with XML elements containing data. For details about writing inline schema as XML Schema, see [Deriving DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema (XSD)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/deriving-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml-schema-xsd.md).  \n  \n If the XML document passed to **ReadXmlSchema** contains no inline schema information, **ReadXmlSchema** will infer the schema from the elements in the XML document. If the **DataSet** already contains a schema, the current schema will be extended by adding new tables if they do not already exist. New columns will not be added to added to existing tables. If a column being added already exists in the **DataSet** but has an incompatible type with the column found in the XML, an exception is thrown. For details about how **ReadXmlSchema** infers a schema from an XML document, see [Inferring DataSet Relational Structure from XML](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/inferring-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml.md).  \n  \n Although **ReadXmlSchema** loads or infers only the schema of a **DataSet**, the **ReadXml** method of the **DataSet** loads or infers both the schema and the data contained in the XML document. For more information, see [Loading a DataSet from XML](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/loading-a-dataset-from-xml.md).  \n  \n The following code examples show how to load a **DataSet** schema from an XML document or stream. The first example shows an XML Schema file name being passed to the **ReadXmlSchema** method. The second example shows a **System.IO.StreamReader**.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \ndataSet.ReadXmlSchema(\"schema.xsd\")  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \ndataSet.ReadXmlSchema(\"schema.xsd\");  \n```  \n  \n```vb  \nDim xmlStream As System.IO.StreamReader = New System.IO.StreamReader (\"schema.xsd\");  \nDim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \ndataSet.ReadXmlSchema(xmlStream)  \nxmlStream.Close()  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nSystem.IO.StreamReader xmlStream = new System.IO.StreamReader(\"schema.xsd\");  \nDataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \ndataSet.ReadXmlSchema(xmlStream);  \nxmlStream.Close();  \n```  \n  \n## InferXmlSchema  \n You can also instruct the **DataSet** to infer its schema from an XML document using the **InferXmlSchema** method of the **DataSet**. **InferXmlSchema** functions the same as do both **ReadXml** with an **XmlReadMode** of **InferSchema** (loads data as well as infers schema), and **ReadXmlSchema** if the document being read contains no inline schema. However, **InferXmlSchema** provides the additional capability of allowing you to specify particular XML namespaces to be ignored when the schema is inferred. **InferXmlSchema** takes two required arguments: the location of the XML document, specified by a file name, a stream, or an **XmlReader**; and a string array of XML namespaces to be ignored by the operation.  \n  \n For example, consider the following XML:  \n  \n```xml  \n<NewDataSet xmlns:od=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:officedata\">  \n<Categories>  \n  <CategoryID od:adotype=\"3\">1</CategoryID>   \n  <CategoryName od:maxLength=\"15\" od:adotype=\"130\">Beverages</CategoryName>   \n  <Description od:adotype=\"203\">Soft drinks and teas</Description>   \n</Categories>  \n<Products>  \n  <ProductID od:adotype=\"20\">1</ProductID>   \n  <ReorderLevel od:adotype=\"3\">10</ReorderLevel>   \n  <Discontinued od:adotype=\"11\">0</Discontinued>   \n</Products>  \n</NewDataSet>  \n```  \n  \n Because of the attributes specified for the elements in the preceding XML document, both the **ReadXmlSchema** method and the **ReadXml** method with an **XmlReadMode** of **InferSchema** would create tables for every element in the document: **Categories**, **CategoryID**, **CategoryName**, **Description**, **Products**, **ProductID**, **ReorderLevel**, and **Discontinued**. (For more information, see [Inferring DataSet Relational Structure from XML](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/inferring-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml.md).) However, a more appropriate structure would be to create only the **Categories** and **Products** tables, and then to create **CategoryID**, **CategoryName**, and **Description** columns in the **Categories** table, and **ProductID**, **ReorderLevel**, and **Discontinued** columns in the **Products** table. To ensure that the inferred schema ignores the attributes specified in the XML elements, use the **InferXmlSchema** method and specify the XML namespace for **officedata** to be ignored, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n```vb  \nDim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \ndataSet.InferXmlSchema(\"input_od.xml\", New String() {\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:officedata\"})  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nDataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \ndataSet.InferXmlSchema(\"input_od.xml\", new string[] \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:officedata\");  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Using XML in a DataSet](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/using-xml-in-a-dataset.md)\n- [Deriving DataSet Relational Structure from XML Schema (XSD)](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/deriving-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml-schema-xsd.md)\n- [Inferring DataSet Relational Structure from XML](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/inferring-dataset-relational-structure-from-xml.md)\n- [Loading a DataSet from XML](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/loading-a-dataset-from-xml.md)\n- [DataSets, DataTables, and DataViews](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/index.md)\n- [ADO.NET Managed Providers and DataSet Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=217917)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,161],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: 43dfb23b-5cef-46f2-8d87-78f0fba1eb8c","nodes":[{"content":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","nodes":[{"pos":[0,43],"content":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","nodes":[{"content":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","pos":[0,43]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[168,211],"content":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","linkify":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","nodes":[{"content":"Loading DataSet Schema Information from XML","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"The schema of a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Data.DataSet&gt;</ph> (its tables, columns, relations, and constraints) can be defined programmatically, created by the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fill<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> or <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>FillSchema<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> methods of a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter&gt;</ph>, or loaded from an XML document.","pos":[212,463],"source":"The schema of a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> (its tables, columns, relations, and constraints) can be defined programmatically, created by the **Fill** or **FillSchema** methods of a <xref:System.Data.Common.DataAdapter>, or loaded from an XML document."},{"content":"To load <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>DataSet<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> schema information from an XML document, you can use either the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>ReadXmlSchema<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> or the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>InferXmlSchema<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> method of the <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>DataSet<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept>.","pos":[464,618],"source":" To load **DataSet** schema information from an XML document, you can use either the **ReadXmlSchema** or the **InferXmlSchema** method of the **DataSet**."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ReadXmlSchema<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> allows you to load or infer <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>DataSet<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> schema information from the document containing XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema, or an XML document with inline XML Schema.","pos":[619,812],"source":"**ReadXmlSchema** allows you to load or infer **DataSet** schema information from the document containing XML Schema definition language (XSD) schema, or an XML document with inline XML Schema."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>InferXmlSchema<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> allows you to infer the schema from the XML document while ignoring certain XML namespaces that you specify.","pos":[813,940],"source":"**InferXmlSchema** allows you to infer the schema from the XML document while ignoring certain XML namespaces that you specify."},{"pos":[948,1415],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Table ordering in a **DataSet** might not be preserved when you use Web services or XML serialization to transfer a **DataSet** that was created in-memory by using XSD constructs (such as nested relations).
