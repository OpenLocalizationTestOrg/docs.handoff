Although these are two different view technologies, they interoperate smoothly.  \n  \n The Windows Forms Designer provides a visual design environment for hosting Windows Presentation Foundation controls. A WPF control is hosted by a special Windows Forms control that is named <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>. This control enables the WPF control to participate in the form's layout and to receive keyboard and mouse messages. At design time, you can arrange the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control just as you would any Windows Forms control.  \n  \n You can also use Windows Forms controls in your WPF-based applications. For more information, see [Design XAML in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/designers/designing-xaml-in-visual-studio).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time](how-to-copy-and-paste-an-elementhost-control-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to copy a Windows Presentation Foundation control on a Windows Form.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](walkthrough-arranging-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to use the Windows Forms layout features, such as anchoring and snaplines, to arrange Windows Presentation Foundation controls.\n  \n [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to create a Windows Presentation Foundation control for use in your Windows Forms-based applications.\n  \n [Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](walkthrough-assigning-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to select the Windows Presentation Foundation control types you want to display on your form.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Styling WPF Content](walkthrough-styling-wpf-content.md)  \n Shows the workflow between the Windows Forms Designer and the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)] for applying styles to Windows Presentation Foundation controls.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
