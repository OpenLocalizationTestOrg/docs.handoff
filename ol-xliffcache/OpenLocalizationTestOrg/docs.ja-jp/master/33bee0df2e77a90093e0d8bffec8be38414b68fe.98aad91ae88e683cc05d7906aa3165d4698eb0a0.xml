For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing. For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md). For workflow services, you can also use [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] configuration elements. For more details about [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md).  \n  \n Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor. Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute. This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [\\<system.serviceModel>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)  \n Describes the **ServiceModel** element.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,77],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,65]}]},{"pos":[344,392],"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","linkify":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","nodes":[{"content":"Windows Workflow Foundation Configuration Schema","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../../includes/wf-md.md)]</ph> configuration elements enable you to configure workflow applications.","pos":[393,511],"source":"[!INCLUDE[wf](../../../../../includes/wf-md.md)] configuration elements enable you to configure workflow applications."},{"content":"For a workflow application, you can configure among other things, tracking and tracing.","pos":[512,599]},{"content":"For more information about tracking and tracing, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Workflow Tracking and Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)</ept>.","pos":[600,777],"source":" For more information about tracking and tracing, see [Workflow Tracking and Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/workflow-tracking-and-tracing.md)."},{"content":"For workflow services, you can also use <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)]</ph> configuration elements.","pos":[778,900],"source":" For workflow services, you can also use [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] configuration elements."},{"content":"For more details about <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)]</ph>, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>WCF Configuration Schema<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md)</ept>.","pos":[901,1086],"source":" For more details about [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], see [WCF Configuration Schema](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/wcf/index.md)."},{"content":"Because configuration files are formatted as XML, you must be familiar with XML if you want to manually edit them using a text editor.","pos":[1093,1227]},{"content":"Otherwise, you may run into issues such as an unfound XML element tag or attribute.","pos":[1228,1311]},{"content":"This is because XML element tags and attributes are case-sensitive.","pos":[1312,1379]},{"pos":[1388,1403],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">\\&lt;</ph>system.serviceModel&gt;<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)</ept>","pos":[1407,1552],"source":"[\\<system.serviceModel>](../../../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/windows-workflow-foundation/system-servicemodel-of-workflow.md)"},{"content":"Describes the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>ServiceModel<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> element.","pos":[1556,1595],"source":" Describes the **ServiceModel** element."}]}
