This topic explores the support for calendars in .NET and discusses the use of the calendar classes when working with date values.\n\n## Calendars in .NET\n\nAll calendars in .NET derive from the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar?displayProperty=fullName> class, which provides the base calendar implementation. One of the classes that inherits from the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> class is the <xref:System.Globalization.EastAsianLunisolarCalendar> class, which is the base class for all lunisolar calendars. .NET includes the following calendar implementations:\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.ChineseLunisolarCalendar>, which represents the Chinese lunisolar calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar>, which represents the Gregorian calendar. This calendar is further divided into subtypes (such as Arabic and Middle East French) that are defined by the <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendarTypes?displayProperty=fullName> enumeration. The <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar.CalendarType%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property specifies the subtype of the Gregorian calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.HebrewCalendar>, which represents the Hebrew calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.HijriCalendar>, which represents the Hijri calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar>, which represents the Japanese calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar>, which represents the Japanese lunisolar calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar>, which represents the Julian calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanCalendar>, which represents the Korean calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanLunisolarCalendar>, which represents the Korean lunisolar calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.PersianCalendar>, which represents the Persian calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanCalendar>, which represents the Taiwan calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanLunisolarCalendar>, which represents the Taiwan lunisolar calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.ThaiBuddhistCalendar>, which represents the Thai Buddhist calendar.\n\n* <xref:System.Globalization.UmAlQuraCalendar>, which represents the Um Al Qura calendar.\n\nA calendar can be used in one of two ways:\n\n* As the calendar used by a specific culture. Each <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object has a current calendar, which is the calendar that the object is currently using. The string representations of all date and time values automatically reflect the current culture and its current calendar. Typically, the current calendar is the culture's default calendar. <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects also have optional calendars, which include additional calendars that that culture can use.\n\n* As a standalone calendar independent of a specific culture. In this case, <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> methods are used to express dates as values that reflect the calendar.\n\nNote that six calendar classes – <xref:System.Globalization.ChineseLunisolarCalendar>, <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar>, <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar>, <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanLunisolarCalendar>, <xref:System.Globalization.PersianCalendar>, and <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanLunisolarCalendar> – can be used only as standalone calendars. They are not used by any culture as either the default calendar or as an optional calendar.\n\n## Calendars and cultures\n\nEach culture has a default calendar, which is defined by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. The <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns an array of <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> objects that specifies all the calendars supported by a particular culture, including that culture's default calendar.\n\nThe following example illustrates the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> properties. It creates `CultureInfo` objects for the Thai (Thailand) and Japanese (Japan) cultures and displays their default and optional calendars. Note that in both cases, the culture's default calendar is also included in the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> collection.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/calendarinfo1.cs#1)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/calendarinfo1.vb#1)]\n\nThe calendar currently in use by a particular <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object is defined by the culture's <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. A culture's <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object is returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.DateTimeFormat%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. When a culture is created, its default value is the same as the value of the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.Calendar%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. However, you can change the culture's current calendar to any calendar contained in the array returned by the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. If you try to set the current calendar to a calendar that is not included in the <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo.OptionalCalendars%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property value, an <xref:System.ArgumentException> is thrown.\n\nThe following example changes the calendar used by the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) culture. It first instantiates a <xref:System.DateTime> value and displays it using the current culture - which, in this case, is English (United States) - and the current culture's calendar (which, in this case, is the Gregorian calendar). Next, it changes the current culture to Arabic (Saudi Arabia) and displays the date using its default Um Al-Qura calendar. It then calls the `CalendarExists` method to determine whether the Hijri calendar is supported by the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) culture. Because the calendar is supported, it changes the current calendar to Hijri and again displays the date. Note that in each case, the date is displayed using the current culture's current calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/changecalendar2.cs#2)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/changecalendar2.vb#2)]\n\n## Dates and calendars\n\nWith the exception of the constructors that include a parameter of type <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> and allow the elements of a date (that is, the month, the day, and the year) to reflect values in a designated calendar, both <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values are always based on the Gregorian calendar. This means, for example, that the <xref:System.DateTime.Year%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the <xref:System.DateTime.Day%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property returns the day of the month in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> It is important to remember that there is a difference between a date value and its string representation. The former is based on the Gregorian calendar; the latter is based on the current calendar of a specific culture.\n\nThe following example illustrates this difference between <xref:System.DateTime> properties and their corresponding <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> methods. In the example, the current culture is Arabic (Egypt), and the current calendar is Um Al Qura. A <xref:System.DateTime> value is set to the fifteenth day of the seventh month of 2011. It is clear that this is interpreted as a Gregorian date, because these same values are returned by the <xref:System.DateTime.ToString%28System.String%2CSystem.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> method when it uses the conventions of the invariant culture. The string representation of the date that is formatted using the conventions of the current culture is 14/08/32, which is the equivalent date in the Um Al Qura calendar. Next, members of `DateTime` and `Calendar` are used to return the day, the month, and the year of the <xref:System.DateTime> value. In each case, the values returned by <xref:System.DateTime> members reflect values in the Gregorian calendar, whereas values returned by <xref:System.Globalization.UmAlQuraCalendar> members reflect values in the Uum al-Qura calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/datesandcalendars2.cs#3)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/datesandcalendars2.vb#3)]\n\n### Instantiating dates based on a calendar\n\nBecause <xref:System.DateTime> and <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> values are based on the Gregorian calendar, you must call an overloaded constructor that includes a parameter of type <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> to instantiate a date value if you want to use the day, month, or year values from a different calendar. You can also call one of the overloads of a specific calendar's <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.ToDateTime%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method to instantiate a <xref:System.DateTime> object based on the values of a particular calendar.\n\nThe following example instantiates one <xref:System.DateTime> value by passing a <xref:System.Globalization.HebrewCalendar> object to a <xref:System.DateTime> constructor, and instantiates a second <xref:System.DateTime> value by calling the <xref:System.Globalization.HebrewCalendar.ToDateTime%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. Because the two values are created with identical values from the Hebrew calendar, the call to the <xref:System.DateTime.Equals%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method shows that the two <xref:System.DateTime> values are equal.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/instantiatehcdate1.cs#4)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/instantiatehcdate1.vb#4)]\n\n### Representing dates in the current calendar\n\nDate and time formatting methods always use the current calendar when converting dates to strings. This means that the string representation of the year, the month, and the day of the month reflect the current calendar, and do not necessarily reflect the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe following example shows how the current calendar affects the string representation of a date. It changes the current culture to Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan), and instantiates a date value. It then displays the current calendar and the date, changes the current calendar to <xref:System.Globalization.TaiwanCalendar>, and displays the current calendar and date once again. The first time the date is displayed, it is represented as a date in the Gregorian calendar. The second time it is displayed, it is represented as a date in the Taiwan calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/currentcalendar1.cs#5)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/currentcalendar1.vb#5)]\n\n### Representing dates in a non-current calendar\n\nTo represent a date using a calendar that is not the current calendar of a particular culture, you must call methods of that <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> object. For example, the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetYear%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetMonth%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetDayOfMonth%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods convert the year, month, and day to values that reflect a particular calendar.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Because some calendars are not optional calendars of any culture, representing dates in these calendars always requires that you call calendar methods. This is true of all calendars that derive from the <xref:System.Globalization.EastAsianLunisolarCalendar>, <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar>, and <xref:System.Globalization.PersianCalendar> classes.\n\nThe following example uses a <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar> object to instantiate a date, January 9, 1905, in the Julian calendar. When this date is displayed using the default (Gregorian) calendar, it is represented as January 22, 1905. Calls to individual <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar> methods enable the date to be represented in the Julian calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/noncurrentcalendar1.cs#6)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/noncurrentcalendar1.vb#6)]\n\n### Calendars and date ranges\n\nThe earliest date supported by a calendar is indicated by that calendar's <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.MinSupportedDateTime%2A?displayProperty=fullName> property. For the <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar> class, that date is January 1, 0001 C.E. Most of the other calendars in .NET support a later date. Trying to work with a date and time value that precedes a calendar's earliest supported date throws an <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> exception.\n\nHowever, there is one important exception. The default (uninitialized) value of a <xref:System.DateTime> object and a <xref:System.DateTimeOffset> object is equal to the <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar.MinSupportedDateTime%2A?displayProperty=fullName> value. If you try to format this date in a calendar that does not support January 1, 0001 C.E. and you do not provide a format specifier, the formatting method uses the \"s\" (sortable date/time pattern) format specifier instead of the \"G\" (general date/time pattern) format specifier. As a result, the formatting operation does not throw an <xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> exception. Instead, it returns the unsupported date. This is illustrated in the following example, which displays the value of <xref:System.DateTime.MinValue?displayProperty=fullName> when the current culture is set to Japanese (Japan) with the Japanese calendar, and to Arabic (Egypt) with the Um Al Qura calendar. It also sets the current culture to English (United States) and calls the <xref:System.DateTime.ToString%28System.IFormatProvider%29?displayProperty=fullName> method with each of these <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects. In each case, the date is displayed by using the sortable date/time pattern.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#11](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/minsupporteddatetime1.cs#11)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#11](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/minsupporteddatetime1.vb#11)]\n\n## Working with eras\n\nCalendars typically divide dates into eras. However, the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> classes in .NET do not support every era defined by a calendar, and most of the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> classes support only a single era. Only the <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> and <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar> classes support multiple eras.\n\n### Eras and era names\n\nIn .NET, integers that represent the eras supported by a particular calendar implementation are stored in reverse order in the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.Eras%2A?displayProperty=fullName> array. The current era is at index zero, and for <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> classes that support multiple eras, each successive index reflects the previous era. The static <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.CurrentEra?displayProperty=fullName> property defines the index of the current era in the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.Eras%2A?displayProperty=fullName> array; it is a constant whose value is always zero. Individual <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> classes also include static fields that return the value of the current era. They are listed in the following table.\n\n| Calendar class                                        | Current era field                                                 |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.ChineseLunisolarCalendar>  | <xref:System.Globalization.ChineseLunisolarCalendar.ChineseEra>   |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar>         | <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar.ADEra>               |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.HebrewCalendar>            | <xref:System.Globalization.HebrewCalendar.HebrewEra>              |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.HijriCalendar>             | <xref:System.Globalization.HijriCalendar.HijriEra>                |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar> | <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar.JapaneseEra> |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar>            | <xref:System.Globalization.JulianCalendar.JulianEra>              |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanCalendar>            | <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanCalendar.KoreanEra>              |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanLunisolarCalendar>   | <xref:System.Globalization.KoreanLunisolarCalendar.GregorianEra>  |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.PersianCalendar>           | <xref:System.Globalization.PersianCalendar.PersianEra>            |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.ThaiBuddhistCalendar>      | <xref:System.Globalization.ThaiBuddhistCalendar.ThaiBuddhistEra>  |\n| <xref:System.Globalization.UmAlQuraCalendar>          | <xref:System.Globalization.UmAlQuraCalendar.UmAlQuraEra>          |\n\nThe name that corresponds to a particular era number can be retrieved by passing the era number to the <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> or <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo.GetAbbreviatedEraName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. The following example calls these methods to retrieve information about era support in the <xref:System.Globalization.GregorianCalendar> class.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/instantiatewithera1.cs#7)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/instantiatewithera1.vb#7)]\n\nIn addition, the \"g\" custom date and time format string includes a calendar's era name in the string representation of a date and time. For more information, see [Custom date and time format strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings.md).\n\n### Instantiating a date with an era\n\nFor the two <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> classes that support multiple eras, a date that consists of a particular year, month, and day of the month value can be ambiguous, For example, all four eras of the <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> have years numbered from 1 to 15. Ordinarily, if an era is not specified, both date and time and calendar methods assume that values belong to the current era. To explicitly specify the era when instantiating a date for a <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> class that supports multiple eras, you can call the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.ToDateTime%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method. This method enables you to explicitly specify an era along with the calendar's year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond.\n\nThe following example uses the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.ToDateTime%28System.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName> method to instantiate the same date, the first month of the first day of the second year, in each era supported by the <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> class. It then displays the date in both the Japanese and Gregorian calendars. It also calls a <xref:System.DateTime> constructor to illustrate that methods that create date values without specifying an era create dates in the current era.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/instantiatewithera1.cs#7)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/instantiatewithera1.vb#7)]\n\n### Representing dates in calendars with eras\n\nIf a <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> object supports eras and is the current calendar of a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object, the era is included in the string representation of a date and time value for the full date and time, long date, and short date patterns. The following example displays these date patterns when the current culture is Japan (Japanese) and the current calendar is the Japanese calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#8](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/formatstrings1.cs#8)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#8](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/formatstrings1.vb#8)]\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> class is the only calendar class in .NET that both supports dates in more than one era and that can be the current calendar of a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object - specifically, of a <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> object that represents the Japanese (Japan) culture.\n\nFor all calendars, the \"g\" custom format specifier includes the era in the result string. The following example uses the \"MM-dd-yyyy g\" custom format string to include the era in the result string when the current calendar is the Gregorian calendar.\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#9](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/formatstrings2.cs#9)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#9](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/formatstrings2.vb#9)]\n\nIn cases where the string representation of a date is expressed in a calendar that is not the current calendar, the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar> class includes a <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetEra%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method that can be used along with the <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetYear%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetMonth%2A?displayProperty=fullName>, and <xref:System.Globalization.Calendar.GetDayOfMonth%2A?displayProperty=fullName> methods to unambiguously indicate a date as well as the era to which it belongs. The following example uses the <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar> class to provide an illustration. However, note that including a meaningful name or abbreviation instead of an integer for the era in the result string requires that you instantiate a <xref:System.Globalization.DateTimeFormatInfo> object and make <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseCalendar> its current calendar. (The <xref:System.Globalization.JapaneseLunisolarCalendar> calendar cannot be the current calendar of any culture, but in this case the two calendars share the same eras.)\n\n[!code-csharp[Conceptual.Calendars#10](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/cs/formatstrings3.cs#10)]\n[!code-vb[Conceptual.Calendars#10](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CLR/conceptual.calendars/vb/formatstrings3.vb#10)]\n\n##
