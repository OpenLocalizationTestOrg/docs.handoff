This section includes both conceptual content and a [quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md) tutorial.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n The following topics describe how to create data services by using [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)].  \n  \n [Exposing Your Data as a Service](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/exposing-your-data-as-a-service-wcf-data-services.md)  \n Describes the steps that are required to create a data service by using [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)].  \n  \n [Accessing Data Service Resources](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/accessing-data-service-resources-wcf-data-services.md)  \n Describes how to work with [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feeds.  \n  \n [Using a Data Service in a Client Application](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/using-a-data-service-in-a-client-application-wcf-data-services.md)  \n Describes how to work with an [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] feed in a .NET Framework client application.  \n  \n [Quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md)  \n Shows how to create and access a simple [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)]-based service that exposes a feed based on the Northwind sample database.  \n  \n [Application Scenarios](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/application-scenarios-wcf-data-services.md)  \n Highlights a core set of [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] scenarios that are supported by [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)].  \n  \n [Resources](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-resources.md)  \n Provides links to [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssODataShort](../../../../includes/ssodatashort-md.md)] resources.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [WCF Data Services
