For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  \n  \n## Properties  \n The properties of the `My.Settings` object provide access to your application's settings. To add or remove settings, use the **Settings Designer**.  \n  \n Each setting has a **Name**, **Type**, **Scope**, and **Value**, and these settings determine how the property to access each setting appears in the `My.Settings` object:  \n  \n-   **Name** determines the name of the property.  \n  \n-   **Type** determines the type of the property.  \n  \n-   **Scope** indicates if the property is read-only. If the value is **Application**, the property is read-only; if the value is **User**, the property is read-write.  \n  \n-   **Value** is the default value of the property.  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method|Description|  \n|---|---|  \n|`Reload`|Reloads the user settings from the last saved values.|  \n|`Save`|Saves the current user settings.|  \n  \n The `My.Settings` object also provides advanced properties and methods, inherited from the <xref:System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase> class.  \n  \n## Tasks  \n The following table lists examples of tasks involving the `My.Settings` object.  \n  \n|To|See|  \n|---|---|  \n|Read an application setting|[How to: Read Application Settings in Visual
