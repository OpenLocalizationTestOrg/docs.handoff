Pass the name of a file (or a stream) to a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> constructor. After you have created a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object, pass that <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawImage%2A> method of a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object.  \n  \n The example creates a <xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.Metafile> object from an EMF (enhanced metafile) file and then draws the image with its upper-left corner at (60, 10).  \n  \n The following illustration shows the metafile drawn at the specified location.  \n  \n ![Image Position](./media/imageposition2.png \"imageposition2\")  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#41](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages#41](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.WorkingWithImages/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Working with Images, Bitmaps, Icons, and Metafiles](working-with-images-bitmaps-icons-and-metafiles.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,260],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Load and Display Metafiles\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  -
