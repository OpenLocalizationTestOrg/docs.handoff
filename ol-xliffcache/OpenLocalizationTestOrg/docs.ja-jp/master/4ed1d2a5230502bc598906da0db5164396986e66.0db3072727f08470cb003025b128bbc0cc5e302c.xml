However, there will be times when you will want to programmatically control the splitter—where it is positioned and to what degree it can be moved.  \n  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property and the other properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs. These properties are listed in the following table.  \n  \n|Name|Description|  \n|----------|-----------------|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A> property|Determines if the splitter is movable by means of the keyboard or mouse.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A> property|Determines the distance in pixels from the left or upper edge to the movable splitter bar.|  \n|<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property|Determines the minimum distance, in pixels, that the splitter can be moved by the user.|  \n  \n The example below modifies the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to create a \"snapping splitter\" effect; when the user drags the splitter, it increments in units of 10 pixels rather than the default 1.  \n  \n### To define SplitContainer resize behavior  \n  \n1.  In a procedure, set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property to the desired size, so that the 'snapping' behavior of the splitter is achieved.  \n  \n     In the following code example, within the form's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event, the splitter within the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control is set to jump 10 pixels when dragged.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, _  \n        ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load  \n        Dim splitSnapper as new SplitContainer()  \n        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10  \n        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill  \n        splitSnapper.Parent = me  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void Form1_Load(System.Object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n        SplitContainer splitSnapper = new SplitContainer();  \n        splitSnapper.SplitterIncrement = 10;  \n        splitSnapper.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;  \n        splitSnapper.Parent = this;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n     (Visual C#) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Form1_Load);  \n    ```  \n  \n     Moving the splitter slightly to the left or right will have no discernible effect; however, when the mouse pointer goes 10 pixels in either direction, the splitter will snap to the new position.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer>\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,354],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"split windows [Windows Forms], resizing\"\n  - \"splitter windows [Windows Forms], resizing\"\n  - \"SplitContainer control [Windows Forms], resizing\"\nms.assetid: 9bf73f36-ed2d-4a02-b15a-0770eff4fdfa","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","nodes":[{"pos":[0,64],"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","pos":[0,64]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[361,425],"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","linkify":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Define Resize and Positioning Behavior in a Split Window","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"The panels of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer&gt;</ph> control lend themselves well to being resized and manipulated by users.","pos":[426,558],"source":"The panels of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control lend themselves well to being resized and manipulated by users."},{"content":"However, there will be times when you will want to programmatically control the splitter—where it is positioned and to what degree it can be moved.","pos":[559,706]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property and the other properties on the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer&gt;</ph> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs.","pos":[713,958],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property and the other properties on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer> control give you precise control over the behavior of your user interface to suit your needs."},{"content":"These properties are listed in the following table.","pos":[959,1010]},{"content":"Name","pos":[1017,1021]},{"content":"Description","pos":[1022,1033]},{"pos":[1071,1141],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A&gt;</ph> property","source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.IsSplitterFixed%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines if the splitter is movable by means of the keyboard or mouse.","pos":[1142,1214]},{"pos":[1219,1290],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A&gt;</ph> property","source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterDistance%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines the distance in pixels from the left or upper edge to the movable splitter bar.","pos":[1291,1381]},{"pos":[1386,1458],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property","source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A> property"},{"content":"Determines the minimum distance, in pixels, that the splitter can be moved by the user.","pos":[1459,1546]},{"pos":[1554,1794],"content":"The example below modifies the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.SplitContainer.SplitterIncrement%2A&gt;</ph> property to create a \"snapping splitter\" effect;
