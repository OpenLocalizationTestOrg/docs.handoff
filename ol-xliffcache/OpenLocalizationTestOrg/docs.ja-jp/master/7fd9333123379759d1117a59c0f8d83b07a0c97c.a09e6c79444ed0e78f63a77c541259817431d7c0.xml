It is not possible to map different MSMQ messages to operation contracts automatically. Therefore, there can be only one operation contract. To overcome this limitation, the service implements the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IDispatchOperationSelector.SelectOperation%2A> method of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IDispatchOperationSelector> interface. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.IDispatchOperationSelector.SelectOperation%2A> method enables the service to map a given header of the message to a particular service operation. In this sample, the message's label header is mapped to the service operations. The `Name` parameter of the operation contract determines which service operation must be dispatched for a given message label. For example, if the message's label header contains \"SubmitPurchaseOrder\", the \"SubmitPurchaseOrder\" service operation is invoked.  \n  \n```  \npublic class OperationSelector : IDispatchOperationSelector  \n{  \n    public string SelectOperation(ref System.ServiceModel.Channels.Message message)  \n    {  \n        MsmqIntegrationMessageProperty property = MsmqIntegrationMessageProperty.Get(message);  \n        return property.Label;  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The service must implement the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IContractBehavior.ApplyDispatchBehavior%28System.ServiceModel.Description.ContractDescription%2CSystem.ServiceModel.Description.ServiceEndpoint%2CSystem.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.DispatchRuntime%29> method of the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IContractBehavior> interface as shown in the following sample code. This applies the custom `OperationSelector` to the service framework dispatch runtime.  \n  \n```  \nvoid IContractBehavior.ApplyDispatchBehavior(ContractDescription description, ServiceEndpoint endpoint, DispatchRuntime dispatch)  \n{  \n    dispatch.OperationSelector = new OperationSelector();  \n}  \n```  \n  \n A message must pass through the dispatcher's <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.EndpointDispatcher.ContractFilter%2A> before getting to the OperationSelector. By default a message is rejected if its action cannot be found on any contract implemented by the service. To avoid this check, we implement an <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.IEndpointBehavior> named `MatchAllFilterBehavior`, which allows any message to pass through the `ContractFilter` by applying the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Dispatcher.MatchAllMessageFilter> as follows.  \n  \n```  \npublic void ApplyDispatchBehavior(ServiceEndpoint serviceEndpoint, EndpointDispatcher endpointDispatcher)  \n{  \n    endpointDispatcher.ContractFilter = new MatchAllMessageFilter();  \n}  \n```  \n  \n When a message is received by the service, the appropriate service operation is dispatched using the information provided by the label header. The body of the message is deserialized into a `PurchaseOrder` object, as shown in the following sample code.  \n  \n```  \n[OperationBehavior(TransactionScopeRequired = true, TransactionAutoComplete = true)]  \npublic void SubmitPurchaseOrder(MsmqMessage<PurchaseOrder> msg)  \n{  \n    PurchaseOrder po = (PurchaseOrder)msg.Body;  \n    Random statusIndexer = new Random();  \n    po.Status = (OrderStates)statusIndexer.Next(3);  \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Processing {0} \", po);  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The service is self-hosted. When using the MSMQ, the queue that is used must be created in advance. This can be done manually or through code. In this sample, the service contains code to check for the existence of the queue and creates it if the queue does not exist. The queue name is read from the configuration file.  \n  \n```  \npublic static void Main()  \n{  \n    // Get MSMQ queue name from app settings in configuration  \n    string queueName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"orderQueueName\"];  \n  \n    // Create the transacted MSMQ queue if necessary.  \n    if (!MessageQueue.Exists(queueName))  \n        MessageQueue.Create(queueName, true);  \n  \n    // Create a ServiceHost for the CalculatorService type.  \n    using (ServiceHost serviceHost = new ServiceHost(typeof(OrderProcessorService)))  \n    {                 \n        ServiceEndpoint endpoint = serviceHost.Description.Endpoints[0];  \n        endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new MatchAllFilterBehavior());  \n  \n        //Open the ServiceHost to create listeners and start listening for messages.  \n        serviceHost.Open();  \n  \n        // The service can now be accessed.  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The service is ready.\");  \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press <ENTER> to terminate service.\");  \n        Console.ReadLine();  \n  \n        // Close the ServiceHost to shutdown the service.  \n        serviceHost.Close();  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n The MSMQ queue name is specified in an appSettings section of the configuration file.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The queue name uses a dot (.) for the local computer and backslash separators in its path. The [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] endpoint address specifies a msmq.formatname scheme, and uses localhost for the local computer. What follows the scheme is a properly formatted queue address according to the MSMQ Format name addressing guidelines.  \n  \n```  \n<appSettings>  \n    <!-- Use appSetting to configure the MSMQ queue name. -->  \n    <add key=\"queueName\" value=\".\\private$\\Orders\" />  \n</appSettings>  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This sample requires the installation of [Message Queuing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=95143).  \n  \n Start the service and run the client.  \n  \n The following output is seen on the client.  \n  \n```  \nPlaced the order:Purchase Order: 28fc457a-1a56-4fe0-9dde-156965c21ed6  \n        Customer: somecustomer.com  \n        OrderDetails  \n                Order LineItem: 54 of Blue Widget @unit price: $29.99  \n                Order LineItem: 890 of Red Widget @unit price: $45.89  \n        Total cost of this order: $42461.56  \n        Order status: Pending  \nCanceled the Order: 28fc457a-1a56-4fe0-9dde-156965c21ed6  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate client.  \n```  \n  \n The following output must be seen on the service.  \n  \n```  \nThe service is ready.  \nPress <ENTER> to terminate service.  \nProcessing Purchase Order: 28fc457a-1a56-4fe0-9dde-156965c21ed6  \n        Customer: somecustomer.com  \n        OrderDetails  \n                Order LineItem: 54 of Blue Widget @unit price: $29.99  \n                Order LineItem: 890 of Red Widget @unit price: $45.89  \n        Total cost of this order: $42461.56  \n        Order status: Shipped  \nPurchase Order 28fc457a-1a56-4fe0-9dde-156965c21ed6 is canceled  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  If the service is run first, it will check to ensure that the queue is present. If the queue is not present, the service will create one. You can run the service first to create the queue, or you can create one via the MSMQ Queue Manager. Follow these steps to create a queue in Windows 2008.  \n  \n    1.  Open Server Manager in [!INCLUDE[vs_current_long](../../../../includes/vs-current-long-md.md)].  \n  \n    2.  Expand the **Features** tab.  \n  \n    3.  Right-click **Private Message Queues**, and select **New**, **Private Queue**.  \n  \n    4.  Check the **Transactional** box.  \n  \n    5.  Enter `ServiceModelSamplesTransacted` as the name of the new queue.  \n  \n3.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n4.  To run the sample in a single- or cross- computer configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n### To run the sample across computers  \n  \n1.  Copy the service program files from the \\service\\bin\\ folder, under the language-specific folder, to the service computer.  \n  \n2.  Copy the client program files from the \\client\\bin\\ folder, under the language-specific folder, to the client computer.  \n  \n3.  In the Client.exe.config file, change the orderQueueName to specify the service computer name instead of \".\".  \n  \n4.  On the service computer, launch Service.exe from a command prompt.  \n  \n5.  On the client computer, launch Client.exe from a command prompt.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer.
