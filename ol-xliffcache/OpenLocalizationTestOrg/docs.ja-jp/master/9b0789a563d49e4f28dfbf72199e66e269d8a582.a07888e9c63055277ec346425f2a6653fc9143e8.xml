This same meaning of the attribute persists in XAML; however, some additional considerations apply.  \n  \n## XAML Attribute Usage  \n  \n```  \n<object xml:lang=\"rfc3066lang\" />  \n```  \n  \n## XAML Values  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|*rfc3066lang*|A string that is derived from the [RFC 3066](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=132454) standard and identifies either a language or a language-region. When it is the latter, the language and region are separated by a single hyphen. See <xref:System.Windows.Markup.XmlLanguage> for more information about the values and format.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n The definition for the `xml:lang` attribute in [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] is derived from `xml:lang` as defined as a \"special attribute\" by the [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_w3c](../../../includes/tlasharptla-w3c-md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)]. Language and culture information is potentially processed in different ways by elements, depending on their implementations; however, there is no default [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] processing of the `xml:lang` attribute.  \n  \n The default value of the `xml:lang` attribute is an empty string at the attribute level.  \n  \n The `xml:lang` attribute effects and the value of the attribute are generally perpetuated to child elements, when interpreted by systems that act on `xml:lang` values.  \n  \n When interpreted by XAML writers of .NET Framework XAML Services, an `xml:lang` value can create <xref:System.Windows.Markup.XmlLanguage> or <xref:System.Globalization.CultureInfo> objects in the underlying object representation; however, that behavior depends on whether the value specified for `xml:lang` is a valid construction for those classes.  \n  \n Frameworks can create associations between framework-defined properties and the meaning of `xml:lang` in XML by applying <xref:System.Windows.Markup.XmlLangPropertyAttribute> to the property.  \n  \n## WPF Usage Nodes  \n For elements that are derived classes of <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement> or <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkContentElement>, you can use the equivalent <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Language%2A> dependency property instead of the `xml:lang` attribute. By default, the <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Language%2A> property uses \"en-US\" if it is not otherwise set, either through the property or through processing the `xml:lang` attribute.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Globalization for WPF](../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/globalization-for-wpf.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[12,54],"content":"xml:lang Handling in XAML | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"xml:lang Handling in XAML | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[554,579],"content":"xml:lang Handling in XAML","linkify":"xml:lang Handling in XAML","nodes":[{"content":"xml:lang Handling in XAML","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`xml:lang`</ph> attribute is an <ph id=\"ph2\">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)]</ph>-defined attribute that declares the language and culture information for an element in XML.","pos":[580,769],"source":"The `xml:lang` attribute is an [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)]-defined attribute that declares the language and culture information for an element in XML."},{"content":"This same meaning of the attribute persists in XAML;
