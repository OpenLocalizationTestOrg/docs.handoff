Use these classes to manipulate HTML pages hosted in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser> control, or to build new pages from the beginning.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Access the Managed HTML Document Object Model](how-to-access-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  \n Describes how to obtain a valid instance of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlDocument> from either a Windows Forms application or a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.UserControl> hosted in Internet Explorer.  \n  \n [How to: Access the HTML Source in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](how-to-access-the-html-source-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  \n Describes how to obtain the original, unmodified HTML source, and how to obtain the \"live\" source that reflects the current state of the DOM.  \n  \n [How to: Change Styles on an Element in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](how-to-change-styles-on-an-element-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  \n Describes how to manipulate styles, which are used to control the visual display of elements.  \n  \n [Accessing Frames in the Managed HTML Document Object Model](accessing-frames-in-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  \n Describes what frames and framesets are, and how to access the DOM of a frame.  \n  \n [Accessing Unexposed Members on the Managed HTML Document Object Model](accessing-unexposed-members-on-the-managed-html-document-object-model.md)  \n Describes how to access members of the underlying DOM that do not have a managed equivalent.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlDocument>  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlElement>  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.HtmlWindow>  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [WebBrowser Control](webbrowser-control-windows-forms.md)  \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,173],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Using the Managed HTML Document Object Model\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
