For more information about vsvars32.bat, see [Knowledge Base article Q248802](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225042).  \n  \n If the current version of Visual Studio is installed on a computer that also has an earlier version of Visual Studio, you should not run vsvars32.bat or vcvars32.bat from different versions in the same Command Prompt window.  \n  \n### To run VSVARS32.BAT  \n  \n1.  From the **Start** menu, open the **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012**.  \n  \n2.  Change to the Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\\Common7\\Tools or Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\\Common7\\Tools subdirectory of your installation.  \n  \n3.  Run VSVARS32.bat by typing **VSVARS32**.  \n  \n    > [!CAUTION]\n    >  VSVARS32.bat can vary from computer to computer. Do not replace a missing or damaged VSVARS32.bat file with a VSVARS32.bat from another computer. Instead, rerun setup to replace the missing file.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Command-line Building With csc.exe](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,97],"content":"How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,85]}]},{"pos":[935,1003],"content":"How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line","linkify":"How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Set Environment Variables for the Visual Studio Command Line","pos":[0,68]}]},{"content":"The vsvars32.bat file sets the appropriate environment variables to enable command-line builds.","pos":[1004,1099]},{"content":"For more information about vsvars32.bat, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Knowledge Base article Q248802<ept id=\"p1\">](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225042)</ept>.","pos":[1100,1225],"source":" For more information about vsvars32.bat, see [Knowledge Base article Q248802](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=225042)."},{"content":"If the current version of Visual Studio is installed on a computer that also has an earlier version of Visual Studio, you should not run vsvars32.bat or vcvars32.bat from different versions in the same Command Prompt window.","pos":[1232,1456]},{"pos":[1466,1485],"content":"To run VSVARS32.BAT","linkify":"To run VSVARS32.BAT","nodes":[{"content":"To run VSVARS32.BAT","pos":[0,19]}]},{"pos":[1495,1569],"content":"From the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Start<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> menu, open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Developer Command Prompt for VS2012<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"From the **Start** menu, open the **Developer Command Prompt for VS2012**."},{"pos":[1579,1760],"content":"Change to the Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>Version<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>\\Common7\\Tools or Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio <bpt id=\"p2\">*</bpt>Version<ept id=\"p2\">*</ept>\\Common7\\Tools subdirectory of your installation.","source":"Change to the Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\\Common7\\Tools or Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio *Version*\\Common7\\Tools subdirectory of your installation."},{"pos":[1770,1810],"content":"Run VSVARS32.bat by typing <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>VSVARS32<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","source":"Run VSVARS32.bat by typing **VSVARS32**."},{"pos":[1822,2035],"content":"[!CAUTION]\nVSVARS32.bat can vary from computer to computer.
