Metafiles, which are lists of graphics instructions for drawing images at run time, are better suited for stretching than bitmaps are.  \n  \n### To set the SizeMode property at run time  \n  \n1.  Set <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox.SizeMode%2A> to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode> (the default), <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode>, or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode>. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode> means that the image is placed in the control's upper-left corner; if the image is larger than the control, its lower and right edges are clipped. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode> means that the image is centered within the control; if the image is larger than the control, the picture's outside edges are clipped. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode> means that the size of the control is adjusted to the size of the image. <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBoxSizeMode> is the reverse, and means that the size of the image is adjusted to the size of the control.  \n  \n     In the example below, the path set for the location of the image is the My Documents folder. This is done, because you can assume that most computers running the Windows operating system will include this directory. This also allows users with minimal system access levels to safely run the application. The example below assumes a form with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PictureBox> control already added.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub StretchPic()  \n       ' Stretch the picture to fit the control.  \n       PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage  \n       ' Load the picture into the control.  \n       ' You should replace the bold image   \n       ' in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n       PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile _  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath _  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal) _  \n       & \"\\Image.gif\")  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void StretchPic(){  \n       // Stretch the picture to fit the control.  \n       PictureBox1.SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode.StretchImage;  \n       // Load the picture into the control.  \n       // You should replace the bold image   \n       // in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n       // Note the escape character used (@) when specifying the path.  \n       PictureBox1.Image = Image.FromFile _  \n       (System.Environment.GetFolderPath _  \n       (System.Environment.SpecialFolder.Personal) _  \n       + @\"\\Image.gif\")  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void StretchPic()  \n       {  \n          // Stretch the picture to fit the control.  \n          pictureBox1->SizeMode = PictureBoxSizeMode::StretchImage;  \n          // Load the picture into the control.  \n          // You should replace the bold image   \n          // in the sample below with an icon of your own choosing.  \n          pictureBox1->Image = Image::FromFile(String::Concat(  \n             System::Environment::GetFolderPath(  \n             System::Environment::SpecialFolder::Personal),  \n             \"\\\\Image.gif\"));
