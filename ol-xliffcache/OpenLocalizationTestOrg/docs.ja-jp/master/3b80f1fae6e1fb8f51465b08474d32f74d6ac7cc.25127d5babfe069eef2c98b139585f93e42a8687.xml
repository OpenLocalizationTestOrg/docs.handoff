A safe point for a thread is a point in its execution at which garbage collection can be performed.  \n  \n Once a safe point is reached, the runtime guarantees that the suspended thread will not make any further progress in managed code. A thread executing outside managed code is always safe for garbage collection, and its execution continues until it attempts to resume execution of managed code.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In order to perform a garbage collection, the runtime must suspend all the threads except the thread performing the collection.
