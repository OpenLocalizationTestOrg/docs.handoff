This topic demonstrates setting the cache policy programmatically. For information on setting the policy for an application using the configuration files, see [\\<requestCaching> Element (Network Settings)](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/requestcaching-element-network-settings.md).  \n  \n### To set a location-based cache policy for an application  \n  \n1.  Create a <xref:System.Net.Cache.RequestCachePolicy> or <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCachePolicy> object.  \n  \n2.  Set the policy object as the default for the application domain.  \n  \n### To set a policy that takes requested resources from a cache  \n  \n-   Create a policy that takes requested resources from a cache if available, and otherwise, sends requests to the server, by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheIfAvailable>. A request can be fulfilled by any cache between the client and server, including remote caches.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void UseCacheIfAvailable()  \n    {  \n        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheIfAvailable);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub UseCacheIfAvailable()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n             (HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheIfAvailable)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n### To set a policy that prevents any cache from supplying resources  \n  \n-   Create a policy that prevents any cache from supplying requested resources by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.NoCacheNoStore>. This policy level removes the resource from the local cache if it is present and indicates to remote caches that they should also remove the resource.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void DoNotUseCache()  \n    {  \n    HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy   \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.NoCacheNoStore);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub DoNotUseCache()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.NoCacheNoStore)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n### To set a policy that returns requested resources only if they are in the local cache  \n  \n-   Create a policy that returns requested resources only if they are in the local cache by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheOnly>. If the requested resource is not in the cache, a <xref:System.Net.WebException> exception is thrown.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void OnlyUseCache()  \n    {  \n        HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy   \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheOnly);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub OnlyUseCache()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.CacheOnly)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n### To set a policy that prevents the local cache from supplying resources  \n  \n-   Create a policy that prevents the local cache from supplying requested resources by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.Refresh>. If the requested resource is in an intermediate cache and is successfully revalidated, the intermediate cache can supply the requested resource.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void DoNotUseLocalCache()  \n    {  \n     HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy   \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Refresh);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub DoNotUseLocalCache()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Refresh)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n### To set a policy that prevents any cache from supplying requested resources  \n  \n-   Create a policy that prevents any cache from supplying requested resources by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.Reload>. The resource returned by the server can be stored in the cache.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void SendToServer()  \n    {  \n    HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy   \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Reload);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub SendToServer()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Reload)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n### To set a policy that allows any cache to supply requested resources if the resource on the server is not newer than the cached copy  \n  \n-   Create a policy that allows any cache to supply requested resources if the resource on the server is not newer than the cached copy by setting the cache level to <xref:System.Net.Cache.HttpRequestCacheLevel.Revalidate>.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    public static void CheckServer()  \n    {  \n    HttpRequestCachePolicy policy = new HttpRequestCachePolicy  \n             (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Revalidate);  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy;  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Public Shared Sub CheckServer()  \n        Dim policy As New HttpRequestCachePolicy _  \n            (HttpRequestCacheLevel.Revalidate)  \n        HttpWebRequest.DefaultCachePolicy = policy  \n    End Sub  \n    ```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Cache Management for Network
