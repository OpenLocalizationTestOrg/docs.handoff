This list contains all of the analyzers available, although only a subset will apply to any specific migration. The analyzers will determine which issues are applicable for the planned migration and will only surface those. For issues split up by versions impacted, please see: [Application Compatibility](../../../docs/framework/migration-guide/application-compatibility.md).  \n  \n Each issue includes the following information:  \n  \n-   The description of what has changed from a previous version.  \n  \n-   The suggestion is a description of how the change affects customers and whether any workarounds are available to preserve compatibility across versions.  \n  \n-   An assessment of how important the change is. Application compatibility issue are categorized as follows:  \n  \n    |||  \n    |-|-|  \n    |Major|A significant change that affects a large number of apps or requires substantial modification of code.|  \n    |Minor|A change that affects a small number of apps or that requires minor modification of code.|  \n    |Edge case|A change that affects apps under very specific, uncommon scenarios.|  \n    |Transparent|A change with no noticeable effect on the applicationâ€™s developer or user.|  \n  \n-   Version indicates when the change first appears in the framework. Some of the changes are reverted and that is indicated as well.  \n  \n-   The type of change:  \n  \n    |||  \n    |-|-|  \n    |Retargeting|The change affects apps that are recompiled to target a new version of the .NET Framework.|  \n    |Runtime|The change affects an existing app that targets a previous version of the .NET Framework but runs on a later version.|  \n  \n-   The affected APIS, if any.  \n  \n-   The IDs of the available diagnostics  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic1\"></a>   \n## 1: SoapFormatter cannot deserialize Hashtable and similar ordered collection objects  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|The SoapFormatter does not guarantee that objects serialized under one .NET Framework version will successfully deserialize under a different version. Specifically, some ordered collections (like Hashtable) added members between 4.0 and 4.5 such that objects of these types cannot deserialize with .NET 4.0 if they were serialzied with .NET 4.5. Note that if the serialized data is both serialized and deserialized with the same .NET Framework version, no issue will occur.|  \n|Suggestion|SoapFormatter serialization should be replaced with BinaryFormatter serialization or NetDataContractSerialization to be resilient to .NET Framework changes.|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter.Deserialize%28System.IO.Stream%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter.Deserialize%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.HeaderHandler%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter.Serialize%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter.Serialize%28System.IO.Stream%2CSystem.Object%2CSystem.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.Header%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0001B<br /><br /> CD0001A|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic3\"></a>   \n## 3: WPF DataTemplate elements are now visible to UIA  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|Previously, DataTemplate elements were invisible to UI Automation. Beginning in 4.5, UI Automation will detect these elements. This is useful in many cases, but can break tests that depend on UIA trees not containing DataTemplate elements.|  \n|Suggestion|UI Auomation tests for this app may need updated to account for the UIA tree now including previously invisible DataTemplate elements. For example, tests that expect some elements to be next to each other may now need to expect previously invisible UIA elements in between. Or tests that rely on certain counts or indexes for UIA elements may need updated with new values.|  \n|Scope|Edge|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate.%23ctor?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Windows.DataTemplate.%23ctor%28System.Object%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0003|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic4\"></a>   \n## 4: WPF TextBox selected text appears a different color when the text box is inactive  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|In .NET 4.5, when a WPF text box control is inactive (it doesn't have focus), the selected text inside the box will appear a different color than when the control is active.|  \n|Suggestion|Previous (.NET 4.0) behavior may be restored by setting the [FrameworkCompatibilityPreferences.AreInactiveSelectionHighlightBrushKeysSupported](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.windows.frameworkcompatibilitypreferences.areinactiveselectionhighlightbrushkeyssupported\\(v=vs.110\\).aspx) property to false.|  \n|Scope|Edge|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0004|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic5\"></a>   \n## 5: List\\<T>.ForEach can throw exception when modifying list item  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|Beginning in .NET 4.5, a `List<T>.ForEach` enumerator will throw an InvalidOperationException exception if an element in the calling collection is modified. Previously, this would not throw an exception but could lead to race conditions.|  \n|Suggestion|Ideally, code should be fixed to not modify lists while enumerating their elements because that is never a safe operation. To revert to the previous behavior, though, an app may target .NET 4.0.|  \n|Scope|Edge|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Retargeting|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601.ForEach%28System.Action%7B%600%7D%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0005|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic6\"></a>   \n## 6: System.Uri parsing adheres to RFC 3987  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|URI parsing has changed in several ways in .NET 4.5. Note, however, that these changes only affect code targeting .NET 4.5. If a binary targets .NET 4.0, the old behavior will be observed. Changes to URI parsing in .NET 4.5 include:<br /><br /> URI parsing will perform normalization and character checking according to the latest IRI rules in RFC 3987<br /><br /> Unicode normalization form C will only be performed on the host portion of the URI<br /><br /> Invalid mailto: URIs will now cause an exception<br /><br /> Trailing dots at the end of a path segment are now preserved<br /><br /> `file://` URIs do not escape the `?` character<br /><br /> Unicode control characters `U+0080` through `U+009F` are not supported<br /><br /> Comma characters `,` or `%2c` are not automatically unescaped|  \n|Suggestion|If the old .NET 4.0 URI parsing semantics are necessary (they often aren't), they can be used by targeting .NET 4.0. This can be accomplished by using a TargetFrameworkAttribute on the assembly, or through Visual Studio's project system UI in the 'project properties' page.|  \n|Scope|Major|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Retargeting|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Uri.%23ctor%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.Boolean%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.%23ctor%28System.String%2CSystem.UriKind%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.%23ctor%28System.Uri%2CSystem.String%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.TryCreate%28System.String%2CSystem.UriKind%2CSystem.Uri%40%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.TryCreate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.String%2CSystem.Uri%40%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.TryCreate%28System.Uri%2CSystem.Uri%2CSystem.Uri%40%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0006D<br /><br /> CD0006C<br /><br /> CD0006F<br /><br /> CD0006E<br /><br /> CD0006A<br /><br /> CD0006G<br /><br /> CD0006B|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic10\"></a>   \n## 10: System.Uri escaping now supports RFC 3986 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986)  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|URI escaping has changed in .NET 4.5 to support [RFC 3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986). Specific changes include:<br /><br /> `EscapeDataString` escapes reserved characters based on RFC 3986.<br /><br /> `EscapeUriString` does not escape reserved characters.<br /><br /> `UnescapeDataString` does not throw an exception if it encounters an invalid escape sequence.<br /><br /> Unreserved escaped characters are un-escaped.|  \n|Suggestion|Update applications to not rely on UnescapeDataString to throw in the case of an invalid escape sequence. Such sequences must be detected directly now.<br /><br /> Similarly, expect that Escaped and Unescaped URI and Data strings may vary from .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5 and should not be compared across .NET versions directly. Instead, they should be parsed and normalized in a single .NET version before any comparisons are made.|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Uri.EscapeDataString%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.EscapeUriString%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Uri.UnescapeDataString%28System.String%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0010A<br /><br /> CD0010B<br /><br /> CD0010C|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic11\"></a>   \n## 11: System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration unavailable on Windows 8  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|The System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration namespace is unavailable on Windows 8 or above.|  \n|Suggestion|Apps that support Windows 8 or above must be updated to not depend on this namespace or its members.|  \n|Scope|Major|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Collaboration?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0011|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic12\"></a>   \n## 12: MEF catalogs implement IEnumerable and therefore can no longer be used to create a serializer  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|Starting with the .NET Framework 4.5, MEF catalogs implement IEnumerable and therefore can no longer be used to create a serializer (XmlSerializer object).

To ensure high quality, it is recommended that all binaries be explicitly attributed with a TargetFrameworkAttribute indicating the version of the .NET Framework they were built with. Note that using a target framework moniker in a project file will caues MSBuild to automatically apply a TargetFrameworkAttribute.|  \n|Suggestion|A [target framework attribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.versioning.targetframeworkattribute\\(v=vs.110\\).aspx) should be supplied, either through adding the attribute directly to the assembly or by specifying a target framework in the [project file or through Visual Studio's project properties GUI](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2010/05/19/visual-studio-managed-multi-targeting-part-1-concepts-target-framework-moniker-target-framework.aspx).|  \n|Scope|Major|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Analyzers|CD0013|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic14\"></a>   \n## 14: No longer able to set EnableViewStateMac to false  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|ASP.NET no longer allows developers to specify `<pages enableViewStateMac=\"false\"/>` or `<@Page EnableViewStateMac=\"false\" %>`. The view state message authentication code (MAC) is now enforced for all requests with embedded view state. Only apps that explicitly set the EnableViewStateMac property to false are affected.|  \n|Suggestion|EnableViewStateMac must be assumed to be true, and any resulting MAC errors must be resolved (as explained in [this](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2915218) guidance, which contains multiple resolutions depending on the specifics of what is causing MAC errors).|  \n|Scope|Major|  \n|Version|4.5.2|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Analyzers|CD0014|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic18\"></a>   \n## 18: BlockingCollection\\<T>.TryTakeFromAny does not throw anymore  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|If one of the input collections is marked completed, `BlockingCollection<T>.TryTakeFromAny(BlockingCollection<T>[], T)` no longer returns -1 and `BlockingCollection<T>.TakeFromAny` no longer throws an exception. This change makes it possible to work with collections when one of the collections is either empty or completed, but the other collection still has items that can be retrieved.|  \n|Suggestion|If TryTakeFromAny returning -1 or TakeFromAny throwing were used for control-flow purposes in cases of a blocking collection being completed, such code should now be changed to use `.Any(b => b.IsCompleted)` to detect that condition.|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TakeFromAny%28System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%7B%600%7D%5B%5D%2C%600%40%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TakeFromAny%28System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%7B%600%7D%5B%5D%2C%600%40%2CSystem.Threading.CancellationToken%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryTakeFromAny%28System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%7B%600%7D%5B%5D%2C%600%40%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryTakeFromAny%28System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%7B%600%7D%5B%5D%2C%600%40%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%601.TryTakeFromAny%28System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection%7B%600%7D%5B%5D%2C%600%40%2CSystem.TimeSpan%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0018A<br /><br /> CD0018B|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic19\"></a>   \n## 19: XmlSchemaException now sets line positions properly  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|If the LoadOptions.SetLineInfo value is passed to the Load method and a validation error occurs, the XmlSchemaException.LineNumber and XmlSchemaException.LinePosition properties now contain line information.|  \n|Suggestion|Exception-handling code that assumes XmlSchemaException.LineNumber and XmlSchemaException.LinePosition will not be set should be updated since these properties will now be set properly when SetLineInfo is used while loading XML.|  \n|Scope|Edge|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Xml.Linq.LoadOptions?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0019|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic20\"></a>   \n## 20: System.Activities is now APTCA  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|The assembly is marked with the AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute attribute.|  \n|Suggestion|Derived classes cannot be marked with the SecurityCriticalAttribute.

When existing code is recompiled, compilers may resolve calls to Dispatcher.Invoke methods that have a Delegate parameter as calls to Dispatcher.Invoke methods with an System.Action parameter. If a call to a Dispatcher.Invoke overload with a Delegate parameter is resolved as a call to a Dispatcher.Invoke overload with an System.Action parameter, the following differences in behavior may occur:<br /><br /> If an exception occurs, the Dispatcher.UnhandledExceptionFilter and Dispatcher.UnhandledException events are not raised. Instead, exceptions are handled by the UnobservedTaskException event.<br /><br /> Calls to some members, such as DispatcherOperation.Result, block until the operation has completed.|  \n|Suggestion|To avoid ambiguity (and potential differences in exception handling or blocking behaviors), code calling Dispatcher.Invoke can pass an empty object[] as a second parameter to the Invoke call to be sure of resolving to the .NET 4.0 method overload.|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Retargeting|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%28System.Delegate%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%28System.Delegate%2CSystem.TimeSpan%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%28System.Delegate%2CSystem.TimeSpan%2CSystem.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Windows.Threading.Dispatcher.Invoke%28System.Delegate%2CSystem.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority%2CSystem.Object%5B%5D%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0023|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic24\"></a>   \n## 24: EncoderParameter ctor is obsolete  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|The `EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, Int32, Int32)` constructor is obsolete now and will introduce build warnings if used.|  \n|Suggestion|Although the `EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, Int32, Int32)` constructor will continue to work, the following constructor should be used instead to avoid the obsolete build warning when re-compiling code with .NET 4.5 tools: [EncoderParameter.EncoderParameter(Encoder, Int32, EncoderParameterValueType, IntPtr)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh875096\\(v=vs.110\\).aspx).|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Retargeting|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Drawing.Imaging.EncoderParameter.%23ctor%28System.Drawing.Imaging.Encoder%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0024|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic26\"></a>   \n## 26: Change in behavior for Task.WaitAll methods with time-out arguments  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|Task.WaitAll behavior was made more consistent in .NET 4.5.<br /><br /> In the .NET Framework 4, these methods behaved inconsistently. When the time-out expired, if one or more tasks were completed or canceled before the method call, the method threw an AggregateException exception. When the time-out expired, if no tasks were completed or canceled before the method call, but one or more tasks entered these states after the method call, the method returned false.<br />In the .NET Framework 4.5, these method overloads now return false if any tasks are still running when the time-out interval expired, and they throw an AggregateException exception only if an input task was cancelled (regardless of whether it was before or after the method call) and no other tasks are still running.|  \n|Suggestion|If an AggregateException was being caught as a means of detecting a task that was cancelled prior to the WaitAll call being invoked, that code should instead do the same detection via the IsCanceled property (for example: .Any(t => t.IsCanceled)) since .NET 4.6 will only throw in that case if all awaited tasks are completed prior to the timeout.|  \n|Scope|Minor|  \n|Version|4.5|  \n|Type|Runtime|  \n|Affected APIs|<xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WaitAll%28System.Threading.Tasks.Task%5B%5D%2CSystem.Int32%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WaitAll%28System.Threading.Tasks.Task%5B%5D%2CSystem.Int32%2CSystem.Threading.CancellationToken%29?displayProperty=fullName><br /><br /> <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Task.WaitAll%28System.Threading.Tasks.Task%5B%5D%2CSystem.TimeSpan%29?displayProperty=fullName>|  \n|Analyzers|CD0026|  \n  \n<a name=\"diagnostic27\"></a>   \n## 27: Change in behavior in Data Definition Language (DDL) APIs  \n  \n|||  \n|-|-|  \n|Details|The behavior of DDL APIs when AttachDBFilename is specified has changed as follows:<br /><br /> Connection strings need not specify an Initial Catalog value. Previously, both AttatchDBFilename and Initial Catalog were required.<br /><br /> If both AttatchDBFilename and Initial Catalog are specified and the given MDF file exists, the ObjectContext.DatabaseExists method returns true.

Previously, it threw a SqlException exception.|  \n|Suggestion|These changes make it easier to build tools and applications that use the DDL APIs. These changes can affect application compatibility in the following scenarios:<br /><br /> The user writes code that executes a DROP DATABASE command directly instead of calling ObjectContext.DeleteDatabase if ObjectContext.DatabaseExists returns true.
