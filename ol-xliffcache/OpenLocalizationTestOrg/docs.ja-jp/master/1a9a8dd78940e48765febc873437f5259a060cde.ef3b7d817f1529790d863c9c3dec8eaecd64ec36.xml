In this example, the execution property determines the console's foreground color. An example workflow shows how different logical paths of execution (branches of a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity) can maintain different console colors despite interleaved execution of activities (across the branches of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Parallel> activity).  \n  \n#### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Open the ExecutionProperties.sln sample solution in [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  Viewing ThreeColors.xaml before building the solution displays an error, because the custom activities used must be built at the same time as the solution.  \n  \n2.  Build and run the solution.  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your machine. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
