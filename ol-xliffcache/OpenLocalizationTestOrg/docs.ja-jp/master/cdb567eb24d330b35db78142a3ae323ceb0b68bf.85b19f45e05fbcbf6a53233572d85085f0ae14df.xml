Because there is no direct conversion from `RomanNumeral` to `BinaryNumeral`, a cast is used to convert from a `RomanNumeral` to an `int`, and another cast to convert from an `int` to a `BinaryNumeral`.  \n  \n-   Also the statement  \n  \n     [!code-cs[csProgGuideStatements#15](../../../csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to-implement-user-defined-conversions-between-structs_3.cs)]  \n  \n     performs a conversion from a `BinaryNumeral` to a `RomanNumeral`. Because `RomanNumeral` defines an implicit conversion from `BinaryNumeral`, no cast is required.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Reference](../../../csharp/language-reference/index.md)   \n [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)   \n [Conversion Operators](../../../csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/conversion-operators.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,589],"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement User-Defined Conversions Between Structs (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,98],"content":"How to: Implement User-Defined Conversions Between Structs (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Implement User-Defined Conversions Between Structs (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,98]}]}],"pos":[6,107],"yaml":true}],"content":"title: \"How to: Implement User-Defined Conversions Between Structs (C# Programming Guide) | Microsoft Docs\"\n\nms.date: \"2015-07-20\"\nms.prod: .net\n\n\nms.technology: \n  -
