You use it only to access a member of the current instance as if it were `NotOverridable` in the base class.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32028  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  If you intend to access a class member, specify the member access operator (`.`) and a member of the current instance after `MyClass`.  \n  \n2.  If you do not intend to access a class member, use the `Me` keyword.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [MyClass](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#myclass)\n- [Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)\n- [NotOverridable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/notoverridable.md)\n- [Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,212],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"bc32028\"\n  - \"vbc32028\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32028\"\nms.assetid: a7e92b54-32b8-4072-9576-632942f05e0f","nodes":[{"content":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","nodes":[{"pos":[0,51],"content":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","nodes":[{"content":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","pos":[0,51]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[219,270],"content":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","linkify":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","nodes":[{"content":"'MyClass' must be followed by '.' and an identifier","pos":[0,51]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`MyClass`</ph> is not a true object variable, and it cannot appear alone.","pos":[271,339],"source":"`MyClass` is not a true object variable, and it cannot appear alone."},{"content":"You use it only to access a member of the current instance as if it were <ph id=\"ph1\">`NotOverridable`</ph> in the base class.","pos":[340,448],"source":" You use it only to access a member of the current instance as if it were `NotOverridable` in the base class."},{"pos":[455,476],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32028","source":"**Error ID:** BC32028"},{"pos":[485,506],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[516,650],"content":"If you intend to access a class member, specify the member access operator (<ph id=\"ph1\">`.`</ph>) and a member of the current instance after <ph id=\"ph2\">`MyClass`</ph>.","source":"If you intend to access a class member, specify the member access operator (`.`) and a member of the current instance after `MyClass`."},{"pos":[660,728],"content":"If you do not intend to access a class member, use the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Me`</ph> keyword.","source":"If you do not intend to access a class member, use the `Me` keyword."},{"pos":[737,745],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[749,851],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>MyClass<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#myclass)</ept>","source":"[MyClass](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#myclass)"},{"pos":[854,946],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Me<ept id=\"p1\">](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)</ept>","source":"[Me](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/me-my-mybase-and-myclass.md#me)"},{"pos":[949,1032],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>NotOverridable<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/notoverridable.md)</ept>","source":"[NotOverridable](../../visual-basic/language-reference/modifiers/notoverridable.md)"},{"pos":[1035,1153],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Inheritance Basics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)</ept>","source":"[Inheritance Basics](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/objects-and-classes/inheritance-basics.md)"}]}
