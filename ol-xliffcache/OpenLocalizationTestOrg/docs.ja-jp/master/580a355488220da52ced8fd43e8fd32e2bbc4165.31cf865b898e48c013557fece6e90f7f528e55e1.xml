You can enable users to choose a printer from among those currently installed by using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component. Through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult> of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> component is captured and used to select the printer.  \n  \n In the following procedure, a text file is selected to be printed to the default printer. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog> class is then instantiated.  \n  \n### To choose a printer and then print a file  \n  \n1.  Select the printer to be used using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>component.  \n  \n     In the following code example, there are two events being handled. In the first, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button> control's <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Click> event, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>class is instantiated and the printer selected by the user is captured in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DialogResult>property.  \n  \n     In the second event, the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument.PrintPage> event of the <xref:System.Drawing.Printing.PrintDocument>component, a sample document is printed to the printer specified.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click  \n       Dim PrintDialog1 As New PrintDialog()  \n       PrintDialog1.Document = PrintDocument1  \n       Dim result As DialogResult = PrintDialog1.ShowDialog()  \n  \n       If (result = DialogResult.OK) Then  \n         PrintDocument1.Print()  \n       End If   \n  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Private Sub PrintDocument1_PrintPage(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs) Handles PrintDocument1.PrintPage  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red, New Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500))          \n    End Sub  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    private void button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       PrintDialog printDialog1 = new PrintDialog();  \n       printDialog1.Document = printDocument1;  \n       DialogResult result = printDialog1.ShowDialog();  \n       if (result == DialogResult.OK)  \n       {  \n          printDocument1.Print();  \n       }  \n    }  \n  \n    private void printDocument1_PrintPage(object sender,   \n    System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventArgs e)  \n    {  \n       e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Red,   \n         new Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n    }  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    private:  \n       void button1_Click(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::EventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          PrintDialog ^ printDialog1 = gcnew PrintDialog();  \n          printDialog1->Document = printDocument1;  \n          System::Windows::Forms::DialogResult result =   \n             printDialog1->ShowDialog();  \n          if (result == DialogResult::OK)  \n          {  \n             printDocument1->Print();  \n          }  \n       }  \n    private:  \n       void printDocument1_PrintPage(System::Object ^ sender,  \n          System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventArgs ^ e)  \n       {  \n          e->Graphics->FillRectangle(Brushes::Red,  \n             Rectangle(500, 500, 500, 500));  \n       }  \n    ```  \n  \n     ([!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../../../../includes/vcprvc-md.md)]) Place the following code in the form's constructor to register the event handler.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    this.printDocument1.PrintPage += new  \n       System.Drawing.Printing.PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this.printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    this.button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.button1_Click);  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```cpp  \n    this->printDocument1->PrintPage += gcnew  \n       System::Drawing::Printing::PrintPageEventHandler  \n       (this, &Form1::printDocument1_PrintPage);  \n    this->button1->Click += gcnew  \n       System::EventHandler(this, &Form1::button1_Click);
