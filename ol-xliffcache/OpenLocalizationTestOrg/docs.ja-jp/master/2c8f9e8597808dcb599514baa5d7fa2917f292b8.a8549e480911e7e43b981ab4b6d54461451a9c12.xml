You specified an operation or property that is exclusive to collections, but the object is not a collection.  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a `Collection` object.  \n  \n2.  Look at the `Add`method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any identifiers were spelled correctly.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Collection>","nodes":[{"pos":[12,115],"content":"Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,103]}]},{"pos":[629,715],"content":"Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object","linkify":"Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object","nodes":[{"content":"Property let procedure not defined and property get procedure did not return an object","pos":[0,86]}]},{"content":"Certain properties, methods, and operations can only apply to <ph id=\"ph1\">`Collection`</ph> objects.","pos":[716,799],"source":"Certain properties, methods, and operations can only apply to `Collection` objects."},{"content":"You specified an operation or property that is exclusive to collections, but the object is not a collection.","pos":[800,908]},{"pos":[917,938],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[948,1050],"content":"Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a <ph id=\"ph1\">`Collection`</ph> object.","source":"Check the spelling of the object or property name, or verify that the object is a `Collection` object."},{"pos":[1060,1206],"content":"Look at the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Add`</ph>method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any identifiers were spelled correctly.","source":"Look at the `Add`method used to add the object to the collection to be sure the syntax is correct and that any identifiers were spelled correctly."},{"pos":[1215,1223],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
