Development and deployment are now both easier and more flexible. The key infrastructural change is that the new activity designer programming model is built upon [!INCLUDE[avalon1](../../../includes/avalon1-md.md)]. This gives you the ability to define activity designers declaratively and to rehost the [!INCLUDE[wfd2](../../../includes/wfd2-md.md)] in other applications with comparative easy. When rehosting, a custom expression editor can be developed to support IntelliSense or a simplified expression domain. The integration with [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] has become more seamless with use of workflow services. Custom activity designers and the Model Item Tree can be used to enhance design time experiences in rehosted workflow designers.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Using Custom Activity Designers and Templates](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-custom-activity-designers-and-templates.md)  \n Describes how to create new custom activity designers and templates.  \n  \n [Rehosting the Workflow Designer](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/rehosting-the-workflow-designer.md)  \n Describes how to re-host the [!INCLUDE[wfd1](../../../includes/wfd1-md.md)] outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] and how to display validation errors.  \n  \n [Using a Custom Expression Editor](../../../docs/framework/windows-workflow-foundation/using-a-custom-expression-editor.md)  \n Describes how to implement a custom expression editor to use with workflow designers rehosted outside of [!INCLUDE[vs2010](../../../includes/vs2010-md.md)].  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Activities.Presentation.ActivityDesigner>  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Extending Windows Workflow
