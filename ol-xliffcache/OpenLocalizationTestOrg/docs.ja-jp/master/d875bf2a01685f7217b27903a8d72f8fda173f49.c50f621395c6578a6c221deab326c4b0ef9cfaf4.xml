World with the Routing Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/hello-world-with-the-routing-service.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Router.  \n  \n [Bridging and Error Handling](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/bridging-and-error-handling.md)  \n Demonstrates how the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] routing service is used for bridging communication between a client and a service that use different bindings.  \n  \n [Advanced Filters](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/advanced-filters.md)  \n Demonstrates how to adapt the standard [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] Calculator sample to communicate using the routing service.  \n  \n [Dynamic Reconfiguration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/dynamic-reconfiguration.md)  \n Demonstrates how the routing service can be dynamically reconfigured during runtime.  \n  \n [Advanced Error Handling](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/advanced-error-handling.md)  \n Demonstrates how the routing service intelligently recovers from errors, using transactions and other more complex messaging concepts such as multicasting.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,45],"content":"Routing Services | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Routing Services | Microsoft
