Implementations of .NET include the .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Mono. There is an API specification common to all implementations of .NET that's called the .NET Standard. This article gives a brief introduction to each of these concepts.\n\n## .NET Standard\n\nThe .NET Standard is a set of APIs that are implemented by the Base Class Library of a .NET implementation. More formally, it's a specification of .NET APIs that make up a uniform set of contracts that you compile your code against. These contracts are implemented in each .NET implementation. This enables portability across different .NET implementations, effectively allowing your code to run everywhere.\n\nThe .NET Standard is also a [target framework](glossary.md#target-framework). If your code targets a version of the .NET Standard, it can run on any .NET implementation which supports that version of the .NET Standard.\n\nTo learn more about the .NET Standard and how to target it, see the [.NET Standard](net-standard.md) topic.\n\n## .NET implementations\n\nEach implementation of .NET includes the following components:\n\n- One or more runtimes. Examples: CLR for .NET Framework, CoreCLR and CoreRT for .NET Core.\n- A class library that implements the .NET Standard and may implement additional APIs. Examples: .NET Framework Base Class Library, .NET Core Base Class Library.\n- Optionally, one or more application frameworks. Examples: [ASP.NET](https://www.asp.net/), [Windows Forms](../framework/winforms/windows-forms-overview.md), and [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](../framework/wpf/index.md) are included in the .NET Framework.\n- Optionally, development tools. Some development tools are shared among multiple implementations.\n\nThere are four primary .NET implementations that Microsoft actively develops and maintains: .NET Core, .NET Framework, Mono, and UWP.\n\n### .NET Core\n\n.NET Core is a cross-platform implementation of .NET and designed to handle server and cloud workloads at scale. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It implements the .NET Standard, so code that targets the .NET Standard can run on .NET Core. ASP.NET Core runs on .NET Core. \n\nTo learn more about .NET Core, see the [.NET Core Guide](../core/index.md) and [Choosing between .NET Core and .NET Framework for server apps](choosing-core-framework-server.md).\n\n### .NET Framework\n\nThe.NET Framework is the original .NET implementation that has existed since 2002. It's the same .NET Framework that existing .NET developers have always used. Versions 4.5 and later implement the .NET Standard, so code that targets the .NET Standard can run on those versions of the .NET Framework. It contains additional Windows-specific APIs, such as APIs for Windows desktop development with Windows Forms and WPF. The .NET Framework is optimized for building Windows desktop applications.\n\nTo learn more about the .NET Framework, see the [.NET Framework Guide](../framework/index.md).\n\n### Mono\n\nMono is a .NET implementation that is mainly used when a small runtime is required. It is the runtime that powers Xamarin applications on Android, Mac, iOS, tvOS and watchOS and is focused primarily on a small footprint. Mono also powers games built using the Unity engine.\n\nIt supports all of the currently published .NET Standard versions.\n\nHistorically, Mono implemented the larger API of the .NET Framework and emulated some of the most popular capabilities on Unix. It is sometimes used to run .NET applications that rely on those capabilities on Unix.\n\nMono is typically used with a just-in-time compiler, but it also features a full static compiler (ahead-of-time compilation) that is used on platforms like iOS.\n\nTo learn more about Mono, see the [Mono documentation](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/).\n\n### Universal Windows Platform (UWP)\n\nUWP is an implementation of .NET that is used for building modern, touch-enabled Windows applications and software for the Internet of Things (IoT). It's designed to unify the different types of devices that you may want to target, including PCs, tablets, phablets, phones, and even the Xbox. UWP provides many services, such as a centralized app store, an execution environment (AppContainer), and a set of Windows APIs to use instead of Win32 (WinRT). Apps can be written in C++, C#, VB.NET, and JavaScript. When using C# and VB.NET, the .NET APIs are provided by .NET Core.\n\nTo learn more about UWP, see [Intro to the Universal Windows Platform](/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide).\n\n## .NET runtimes\n\nA runtime is the execution environment for a managed program. The OS is part of the runtime environment but is not part of the .NET runtime. Here are some examples of .NET runtimes:\n\n- Common Language Runtime (CLR) for the .NET Framework\n- Core Common Language Runtime (CoreCLR) for .NET Core\n- .NET Native for Universal Windows Platform \n- The Mono runtime for Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.Mac, and the Mono desktop framework\n\n## .NET tooling and common infrastructure\n\nYou have access to an extensive set of tools and infrastructure components that work with every implementation of .NET. These include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n- The .NET languages and their compilers\n- The .NET project system (based on *.csproj*, *.vbproj*, and *.fsproj* files)\n- [MSBuild](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild), the build engine used to build projects\n- [NuGet](/nuget/), Microsoft's package manager for .NET\n- Open-source build orchestration tools, such as [CAKE](https://cakebuild.net/) and [FAKE](https://fake.build/)\n\n## See also\n\n- [Choosing between .NET Core and .NET Framework for server apps](choosing-core-framework-server.md)\n- [.NET
