This batching mechanism is useful when you collect data from one or more sources and then process multiple data elements as a batch. For example, consider an application that uses dataflow to insert records into a database. This operation can be more efficient if multiple items are inserted at the same time instead of one at a time sequentially. This document describes how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601> class to improve the efficiency of such database insert operations. It also describes how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602> class to capture both the results and any exceptions that occur when the program reads from a database.\n\n[!INCLUDE [tpl-install-instructions](../../../includes/tpl-install-instructions.md)]\n\n## Prerequisites  \n  \n1.  Read the Join Blocks section in the [Dataflow](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md) document before you start this walkthrough.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that you have a copy of the Northwind database, Northwind.sdf, available on your computer. This file is typically located in the folder %Program Files%\\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\\v3.5\\Samples\\\\.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  In some versions of Windows, you cannot connect to Northwind.sdf if Visual Studio is running in a non-administrator mode. To connect to Northwind.sdf, start Visual Studio or a Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio in the **Run as administrator** mode.  \n  \n This walkthrough contains the following sections:  \n  \n-   [Creating the Console Application](#creating)  \n  \n-   [Defining the Employee Class](#employeeClass)  \n  \n-   [Defining Employee Database Operations](#operations)  \n  \n-   [Adding Employee Data to the Database without Using Buffering](#nonBuffering)  \n  \n-   [Using Buffering to Add Employee Data to the Database](#buffering)  \n  \n-   [Using Buffered Join to Read Employee Data from the Database](#bufferedJoin)  \n  \n-   [The Complete Example](#complete)  \n  \n<a name=\"creating\"></a>   \n## Creating the Console Application  \n  \n<a name=\"consoleApp\"></a>   \n1.  In Visual Studio, create a Visual C# or Visual Basic **Console Application** project. In this document, the project is named `DataflowBatchDatabase`.  \n  \n2.  In your project, add a reference to System.Data.SqlServerCe.dll and a reference to System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.dll.  \n  \n3.  Ensure that Form1.cs (Form1.vb for Visual Basic) contains the following `using` (`Imports` in Visual Basic) statements.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#1](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#1)]\n     [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#1](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#1)]  \n  \n4.  Add the following data members to the `Program` class.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#2](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#2](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#2)]  \n  \n<a name=\"employeeClass\"></a>   \n## Defining the Employee Class  \n Add to the `Program` class the `Employee` class.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#3](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#3)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#3](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#3)]  \n  \n The `Employee` class contains three properties, `EmployeeID`, `LastName`, and `FirstName`. These properties correspond to the `Employee ID`, `Last Name`, and `First Name` columns in the `Employees` table in the Northwind database. For this demonstration, the `Employee` class also defines the `Random` method, which creates an `Employee` object that has random values for its properties.  \n  \n<a name=\"operations\"></a>   \n## Defining Employee Database Operations  \n Add to the `Program` class the `InsertEmployees`, `GetEmployeeCount`, and `GetEmployeeID` methods.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#4](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#4)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#4](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#4)]  \n  \n The `InsertEmployees` method adds new employee records to the database. The `GetEmployeeCount` method retrieves the number of entries in the `Employees` table. The `GetEmployeeID` method retrieves the identifier of the first employee that has the provided name. Each of these methods takes a connection string to the Northwind database and uses functionality in the `System.Data.SqlServerCe` namespace to communicate with the database.  \n  \n<a name=\"nonBuffering\"></a>   \n## Adding Employee Data to the Database Without Using Buffering  \n Add to the `Program` class the `AddEmployees` and `PostRandomEmployees` methods.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#5](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#5)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#5](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#5)]  \n  \n The `AddEmployees` method adds random employee data to the database by using dataflow. It creates an <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601> object that calls the `InsertEmployees` method to add an employee entry to the database. The `AddEmployees` method then calls the `PostRandomEmployees` method to post multiple `Employee` objects to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601> object. The `AddEmployees` method then waits for all insert operations to finish.  \n  \n<a name=\"buffering\"></a>   \n## Using Buffering to Add Employee Data to the Database  \n Add to the `Program` class the `AddEmployeesBatched` method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#6](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#6)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#6](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#6)]  \n  \n This method resembles `AddEmployees`, except that it also uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601> class to buffer multiple `Employee` objects before it sends those objects to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601> object. Because the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601> class propagates out multiple elements as a collection, the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601> object is modified to act on an array of `Employee` objects. As in the `AddEmployees` method, `AddEmployeesBatched` calls the `PostRandomEmployees` method to post multiple `Employee` objects; however, `AddEmployeesBatched` posts these objects to the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601> object. The `AddEmployeesBatched`  method also waits for all insert operations to finish.  \n  \n<a name=\"bufferedJoin\"></a>   \n## Using Buffered Join to Read Employee Data from the Database  \n Add to the `Program` class the `GetRandomEmployees` method.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#7](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#7)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#7](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#7)]  \n  \n This method prints information about random employees to the console. It creates several random `Employee` objects and calls the `GetEmployeeID` method to retrieve the unique identifier for each object. Because the `GetEmployeeID` method throws an exception if there is no matching employee with the given first and last names, the `GetRandomEmployees` method uses the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602> class to store `Employee` objects for successful calls to `GetEmployeeID` and <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=nameWithType> objects for calls that fail. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.ActionBlock%601> object in this example acts on a <xref:System.Tuple%602> object that holds a list of `Employee` objects and a list of <xref:System.Exception> objects. The <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602> object propagates out this data when the sum of the received `Employee` and <xref:System.Exception> object counts equals the batch size.  \n  \n<a name=\"complete\"></a>   \n## The Complete Example  \n The following example shows the complete code. The `Main` method compares the time that is required to perform batched database insertions versus the time to perform non-batched database insertions. It also demonstrates the use of buffered join to read employee data from the database and also report errors.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#100](../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/cs/dataflowbatchdatabase.cs#100)]\n [!code-vb[TPLDataflow_BatchDatabase#100](../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/tpldataflow_batchdatabase/vb/dataflowbatchdatabase.vb#100)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Dataflow](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,371],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.technology: dotnet-standard\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Task Parallel Library, dataflows\"\n  - \"TPL dataflow library, improving efficiency\"\nms.assetid: 5beb4983-80c2-4f60-8c51-a07f9fd94cb3\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","nodes":[{"pos":[0,72],"content":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","pos":[0,72]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[378,450],"content":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","linkify":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","nodes":[{"content":"Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency","pos":[0,72]}]},{"content":"The TPL Dataflow Library provides the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602?displayProperty=nameWithType&gt;</ph> classes so that you can receive and buffer data from one or more sources and then propagate out that buffered data as one collection.","pos":[451,798],"source":"The TPL Dataflow Library provides the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes so that you can receive and buffer data from one or more sources and then propagate out that buffered data as one collection."},{"content":"This batching mechanism is useful when you collect data from one or more sources and then process multiple data elements as a batch.","pos":[799,931]},{"content":"For example, consider an application that uses dataflow to insert records into a database.","pos":[932,1022]},{"content":"This operation can be more efficient if multiple items are inserted at the same time instead of one at a time sequentially.","pos":[1023,1146]},{"content":"This document describes how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601&gt;</ph> class to improve the efficiency of such database insert operations.","pos":[1147,1307],"source":" This document describes how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchBlock%601> class to improve the efficiency of such database insert operations."},{"content":"It also describes how to use the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602&gt;</ph> class to capture both the results and any exceptions that occur when the program reads from a database.","pos":[1308,1504],"source":" It also describes how to use the <xref:System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BatchedJoinBlock%602> class to capture both the results and any exceptions that occur when the program reads from a database."},{"pos":[1595,1608],"content":"Prerequisites","linkify":"Prerequisites","nodes":[{"content":"Prerequisites","pos":[0,13]}]},{"pos":[1618,1787],"content":"Read the Join Blocks section in the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Dataflow<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md)</ept> document before you start this walkthrough.","source":"Read the Join Blocks section in the [Dataflow](../../../docs/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library.md) document before you start this walkthrough."},{"content":"Ensure that you have a copy of the Northwind database, Northwind.sdf, available on your computer.","pos":[1797,1894]},{"content":"This file is typically located in the folder %Program Files%\\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\\v3.5\\Samples<ph id=\"ph1\">\\\\</ph>.","pos":[1895,2008],"source":" This file is typically located in the folder %Program Files%\\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\\v3.5\\Samples\\\\."},{"pos":[2020,2296],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\nIn some versions of Windows, you cannot connect to Northwind.sdf if Visual Studio is running in a non-administrator mode.
