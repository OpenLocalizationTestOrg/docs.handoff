Each handle in the array is not guaranteed to be valid. If valid, the handle is to be used as the continue-startup event for the corresponding runtime located in the same index of `ppStringArrayOut`.  \n  \n `ppStringArrayOut`  \n [out] Pointer to an array of strings that specify full paths to CLRs loaded in the process.  \n  \n `pdwArrayLengthOut`  \n [out] Pointer to a DWORD that contains the length of the equally sized `ppHandleArrayOut` and `pdwArrayLengthOut`.  \n  \n## Return Value  \n S_OK  \n The number of CLRs in the process was successfully determined, and the corresponding handle and path arrays were properly filled.  \n  \n E_INVALIDARG  \n Either `ppHandleArrayOut` or `ppStringArrayOut` is null, or `pdwArrayLengthOut` is null.  \n  \n E_OUTOFMEMORY  \n The function is unable to allocate enough memory for the handle and path arrays.  \n  \n E_FAIL (or other E_ return codes)  \n Unable to enumerate loaded CLRs.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n For a target process that is identified by `debuggeePID`, the function returns an array of paths, `ppStringArrayOut`, to CLRs loaded in the process; an array of event handles, `ppHandleArrayOut`, which may contain a continue-startup event for the CLR at the same index; and the size of the arrays, `pdwArrayLengthOut`, which specifies the number of CLRs that are loaded.  \n  \n On the Windows operating system, `debuggeePID` maps to an OS process identifier.  \n  \n The memory for `ppHandleArrayOut` and `ppStringArrayOut` are allocated by this function. To free the memory allocated, you must call [CloseCLREnumeration Function](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/debugging/closeclrenumeration-function.md).  \n  \n This function can be called with both array parameters set to null in order to return the count of CLRs in the target process. From this count, a caller can infer the size of the buffer that will be created: `(sizeof(HANDLE) * count) + (sizeof(LPWSTR) * count) + (sizeof(WCHAR*) * count * MAX_PATH)`.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** dbgshim.h  \n  \n **Library:** dbgshim.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** 3.5 SP1","nodes":[{"pos":[12,51],"content":"EnumerateCLRs Function | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"EnumerateCLRs Function | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[637,659],"content":"EnumerateCLRs Function","linkify":"EnumerateCLRs Function","nodes":[{"content":"EnumerateCLRs Function","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Provides a mechanism for enumerating the CLRs in a process.","pos":[660,719]},{"pos":[728,734],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[950,960],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] Process identifier of the process from which loaded CLRs will be enumerated.","pos":[981,1062]},{"content":"[out] Pointer to an array containing event handles that are used to continue a CLR startup.","pos":[1091,1182]},{"content":"Each handle in the array is not guaranteed to be valid.","pos":[1183,1238]},{"content":"If valid, the handle is to be used as the continue-startup event for the corresponding runtime located in the same index of <ph id=\"ph1\">`ppStringArrayOut`</ph>.","pos":[1239,1382],"source":" If valid, the handle is to be used as the continue-startup event for the corresponding runtime located in the same index of `ppStringArrayOut`."},{"content":"[out] Pointer to an array of strings that specify full paths to CLRs loaded in the process.","pos":[1411,1502]},{"content":"[out] Pointer to a DWORD that contains the length of the equally sized <ph id=\"ph1\">`ppHandleArrayOut`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`pdwArrayLengthOut`</ph>.","pos":[1532,1646],"source":" [out] Pointer to a DWORD that contains the length of the equally sized `ppHandleArrayOut` and `pdwArrayLengthOut`."},{"pos":[1655,1667],"content":"Return Value","linkify":"Return Value","nodes":[{"content":"Return Value","pos":[0,12]}]},{"content":"S_OK","pos":[1671,1675]},{"content":"The number of CLRs in the process was successfully determined, and the corresponding handle and path arrays were properly filled.","pos":[1679,1808]},{"content":"E_INVALIDARG","pos":[1815,1827]},{"content":"Either <ph id=\"ph1\">`ppHandleArrayOut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`ppStringArrayOut`</ph> is null, or <ph id=\"ph3\">`pdwArrayLengthOut`</ph> is null.","pos":[1831,1919],"source":" Either `ppHandleArrayOut` or `ppStringArrayOut` is null, or `pdwArrayLengthOut` is null."},{"content":"E_OUTOFMEMORY","pos":[1926,1939]},{"content":"The function is unable to allocate enough memory for the handle and path arrays.","pos":[1943,2023]},{"content":"E_FAIL (or other E_ return codes)","pos":[2030,2063]},{"content":"Unable to enumerate loaded CLRs.","pos":[2067,2099]},{"pos":[2108,2115],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[2119,2489],"content":"For a target process that is identified by <ph id=\"ph1\">`debuggeePID`</ph>, the function returns an array of paths, <ph id=\"ph2\">`ppStringArrayOut`</ph>, to CLRs loaded in the process;
