To package content for navigation,              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] provides the              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> class. You can navigate from one              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> to another declaratively, by using a              <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink>, or programmatically, by using the              <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>.              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] uses the journal to remember pages that have been navigated from and to navigate back to them.  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>,              <xref:System.Windows.Documents.Hyperlink>,              <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService>, and the journal form the core of the navigation support offered by              [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)]. This overview explores these features in detail before covering advanced navigation support that includes navigation to loose              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xaml-md.md)] files,              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files, and objects.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In this topic, the term \"browser\" refers only to browsers that can host                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications, which currently includes                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_ie](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-ie-md.md)] and Firefox. Where specific                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] features are supported only by a particular browser, the browser version is referred to.  \n   \n     \n## Navigation in WPF Applications  \n This topic provides an overview of the key navigation capabilities in                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)]. These capabilities are available to both standalone applications and                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)], although this topic presents them within the context of an                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)].  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  This topic doesn't discuss how to build and deploy                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)]. For more information on                      [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)], see                      [WPF XAML Browser Applications Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/wpf-xaml-browser-applications-overview.md).  \n  \n This section explains and demonstrates the following aspects of navigation:  \n  \n-   [Implementing a Page](#CreatingAXAMLPage)  \n  \n-   [Configuring a Start Page](#Configuring_a_Start_Page)  \n  \n-   [Configuring the Host Window's Title, Width, and Height](#ConfiguringAXAMLPage)  \n  \n-   [Hyperlink Navigation](#NavigatingBetweenXAMLPages)  \n  \n-   [Fragment Navigation](#FragmentNavigation)  \n  \n-   [Navigation Service](#NavigationService)  \n  \n-   [Programmatic Navigation with the Navigation Service](#Programmatic_Navigation_with_the_Navigation_Service)  \n  \n-   [Navigation Lifetime](#Navigation_Lifetime)  \n  \n-   [Remembering Navigation with the Journal](#NavigationHistory)  \n  \n-   [Page Lifetime and the Journal](#PageLifetime)  \n  \n-   [Retaining Content State with Navigation History](#RetainingContentStateWithNavigationHistory)  \n  \n-   [Cookies](#Cookies)  \n  \n-   [Structured Navigation](#Structured_Navigation)  \n  \n<a name=\"CreatingAXAMLPage\"></a>   \n### Implementing a Page  \n In                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], you can navigate to several content types that include                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_winfx](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-winfx-md.md)] objects, custom objects, enumeration values, user controls,                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] files, and                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_html](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-html-md.md)] files. However, you'll find that the most common and convenient way to package content is by using                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>. Furthermore,                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> implements navigation-specific features to enhance their appearance and simplify development.  \n  \n Using                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>, you can declaratively implement a navigable page of                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] content by using markup like the following.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigationOverviewSnippets#Page1XAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigationOverviewSnippets/CSharp/Page1.xaml#page1xaml)]  \n  \n A                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that is implemented in                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] markup has                          `Page` as its root element and requires the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)][!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xml-md.md)] namespace declaration. The                          `Page` element contains the content that you want to navigate to and display. You add content by setting the                          `Page.Content` property element, as shown in the following markup.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigationOverviewSnippets#Page2XAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigationOverviewSnippets/CSharp/Page2.xaml#page2xaml)]  \n  \n `Page.Content` can only contain one child element; in the preceding example, the content is a single string, \"Hello, Page!\" In practice, you will usually use a layout control as the child element (see                          [Layout](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/advanced/layout.md)) to contain and compose your content.  \n  \n The child elements of a                          `Page` element are considered to be the content of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> and, consequently, you don't need to use the explicit                          `Page.Content` declaration. The following markup is the declarative equivalent to the preceding sample.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigationOverviewSnippets#Page3XAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigationOverviewSnippets/CSharp/Page3.xaml#page3xaml)]  \n  \n In this case,                          `Page.Content` is automatically set with the child elements of the                          `Page` element. For more information, see                          [WPF Content Model](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/controls/wpf-content-model.md).  \n  \n A markup-only                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is useful for displaying content. However, a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can also display controls that allow users to interact with the page, and it can respond to user interaction by handling events and calling application logic. An interactive                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is implemented by using a combination of markup and code-behind, as shown in the following example.  \n  \n [!code-xml[XBAPAppDefSnippets#HomePageMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XBAPAppDefSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml#homepagemarkup)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[XBAPAppDefSnippets#HomePageCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XBAPAppDefSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml.cs#homepagecodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[XBAPAppDefSnippets#HomePageCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/XBAPAppDefSnippets/VisualBasic/HomePage.xaml.vb#homepagecodebehind)]  \n  \n To allow a markup file and code-behind file to work together, the following configuration is required:  \n  \n-   In markup, the                                  `Page` element must include the                                  `x:Class` attribute. When the application is built, the existence of                                  `x:Class` in the markup file causes                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-msbuild-md.md)] to create a                                  `partial` class that derives from                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> and has the name that is specified by the                                  `x:Class` attribute. This requires the addition of an                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] namespace declaration for the                                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)] schema (                                  `xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"` ). The generated                                  `partial` class implements                                  `InitializeComponent`, which is called to register the events and set the properties that are implemented in markup.  \n  \n-   In code-behind, the class must be a                                  `partial` class with the same name that is specified by the                                  `x:Class` attribute in markup, and it must derive from                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>. This allows the code-behind file to be associated with the                                  `partial` class that is generated for the markup file when the application is built (see                                  [Building a WPF Application](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/building-a-wpf-application-wpf.md)).  \n  \n-   In code-behind, the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> class must implement a constructor that calls the                                  `InitializeComponent` method.                                  `InitializeComponent` is implemented by the markup file's generated                                  `partial` class to register events and set properties that are defined in markup.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  When you add a new                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> to your project using                              [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_visualstu](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-visualstu-md.md)], the                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is implemented using both markup and code-behind, and it includes the necessary configuration to create the association between the markup and code-behind files as described here.  \n  \n Once you have a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>, you can navigate to it. To specify the first                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that an application navigates to, you need to configure the start                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>.  \n  \n<a name=\"Configuring_a_Start_Page\"></a>   \n### Configuring a Start Page  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] require a certain amount of application infrastructure to be hosted in a browser. In                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)], the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class is part of an application definition that establishes the required application infrastructure (see                          [Application Management Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/application-management-overview.md)).  \n  \n An application definition is usually implemented using both markup and code-behind, with the markup file configured as an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_msbuild](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-msbuild-md.md)]`ApplicationDefinition` item.

You do this by setting the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.StartupUri%2A> property with the                          [!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_uri](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-uri-md.md)] for the desired                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In most cases, the                              <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is either compiled into or deployed with an application.

Occurs when a new navigation is requested. Can be used to cancel the navigation.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationProgress>. Occurs periodically during a download to provide navigation progress information.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigated>. Occurs when the page has been located and downloaded.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationStopped>. Occurs when the navigation is stopped (by calling                                  <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.StopLoading%2A>), or when a new navigation is requested while a current navigation is in progress.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.NavigationFailed>. Occurs when an error is raised while navigating to the requested content.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.LoadCompleted>. Occurs when content that was navigated to is loaded and parsed, and has begun rendering.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.FragmentNavigation>. Occurs when navigation to a content fragment begins, which happens:  \n  \n    -   Immediately, if the desired fragment is in the current content.  \n  \n    -   After the source content has been loaded, if the desired fragment is in different content.  \n  \n The navigation events are raised in the order that is illustrated by the following figure.  \n  \n ![Page navigation flow chart](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure11.png \"NavigationOverviewFigure11\")  \n  \n In general, a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> isn't concerned about these events. It is more likely that an application is concerned with them and, for that reason, these events are also raised by the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.Navigating?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.NavigationProgress?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.Navigated?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.NavigationFailed?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.NavigationStopped?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.LoadCompleted?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Application.FragmentNavigation?displayProperty=fullName>  \n  \n Every time                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService> raises an event, the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application> class raises the corresponding event.                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow> offer the same events to detect navigation within their respective scopes.  \n  \n In some cases, a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> might be interested in these events. For example, a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> might handle the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigating?displayProperty=fullName> event to determine whether or not to cancel navigation away from itself.

The memory footprint for pages like these could be quite large, particularly if video and audio media are used. Given that the journal \"remembers\" pages that have been navigated to, such an                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbap-md.md)] could quickly consume a large and noticeable amount of memory.  \n  \n For this reason, the default behavior of the journal is to store                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> metadata in each journal entry rather than a reference to a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> object. When a journal entry is navigated to, its                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> metadata is used to create a new instance of the specified                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>. As a consequence, each                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that is navigated has the lifetime that is illustrated by the following figure.  \n  \n ![Page lifetime](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure10.PNG \"NavigationOverviewFigure10\")  \n  \n Although using the default journaling behavior can save on memory consumption, per-page rendering performance might be reduced; reinstantiating a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can be time-intensive, particularly if it has a lot of content. If you need to retain a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> instance in the journal, you can draw on two techniques for doing so. First, you can programmatically navigate to a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> object by calling the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.Navigate%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method.  \n  \n Second, you can specify that                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] retain an instance of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> in the journal by setting the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.KeepAlive%2A> property to                          `true` (the default is                          `false`). As shown in the following example, you can set                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page.KeepAlive%2A> declaratively in markup.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigationOverviewSnippets#KeepAlivePageXAML](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigationOverviewSnippets/CSharp/KeepAlivePage.xaml#keepalivepagexaml)]  \n  \n The lifetime of a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that is kept alive is subtly different from one that is not. The first time a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that is kept alive is navigated to, it is instantiated just like a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> that is not kept alive. However, because an instance of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is retained in the journal, it is never instantiated again for as long as it remains in the journal. Consequently, if a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> has initialization logic that needs to be called every time the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated to, you should move it from the constructor into a handler for the                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> event. As shown in the following figure, the                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Loaded> and                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkElement.Unloaded> events are still raised each time a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated to and from, respectively.  \n  \n ![When the Loaded and Unloaded events are raised](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure17.png \"NavigationOverviewFigure17\")  \n  \n When a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is not kept alive, you should not do either of the following:  \n  \n-   Store a reference to it, or any part of it.  \n  \n-   Register event handlers with events that are not implemented by it.  \n  \n Doing either of these will create references that force the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> to be retained in memory, even after it has been removed from the journal.  \n  \n In general, you should prefer the default                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> behavior of not keeping a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> alive. However, this has state implications that are discussed in the next section.  \n  \n<a name=\"RetainingContentStateWithNavigationHistory\"></a>   \n### Retaining Content State with Navigation History  \n If a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is not kept alive, and it has controls that collect data from the user, what happens to the data if a user navigates away from and back to the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>? From a user experience perspective, the user should expect to see the data they entered previously. Unfortunately, because a new instance of the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is created with each navigation, the controls that collected the data are reinstantiated and the data is lost.  \n  \n Fortunately, the journal provides support for remembering data across                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> navigations, including control data. Specifically, the journal entry for each                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> acts as a temporary container for the associated                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> state. The following steps outline how this support is used when a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated from:  \n  \n1.  An entry for the current                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is added to the journal.  \n  \n2.  The state of the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is stored with the journal entry for that page, which is added to the back stack.  \n  \n3.  The new                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated to.  \n  \n When the page                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated back to, using the journal, the following steps take place:  \n  \n1.  The                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> (the top journal entry on the back stack) is instantiated.  \n  \n2.  The                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is refreshed with the state that was stored with the journal entry for the                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>.  \n  \n3.  The                                  <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is navigated back to.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] automatically uses this support when the following controls are used on a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>:  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.CheckBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ComboBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Expander>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBoxItem>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.MenuItem>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.ProgressBar>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.RadioButton>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Slider>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TabControl>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TabItem>  \n  \n-   <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBox>  \n  \n If a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> uses these controls, data entered into them is remembered across                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> navigations, as demonstrated by the                          **Favorite Color**<xref:System.Windows.Controls.ListBox> in the following figure.  \n  \n ![Page with controls that remember state](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure13.png \"NavigationOverviewFigure13\")  \n  \n When a                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> has controls other than those in the preceding list, or when state is stored in custom objects, you need to write code to cause the journal to remember state across                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> navigations.  \n  \n If you need to remember small pieces of state across                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> navigations, you can use dependency properties (see                          <xref:System.Windows.DependencyProperty>) that are configured with the                          <xref:System.Windows.FrameworkPropertyMetadata.Journal%2A?displayProperty=fullName> metadata flag.  \n  \n If the state that your                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> needs to remember across navigations comprises multiple pieces of data, you may find it less code intensive to encapsulate your state in a single class and implement the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.IProvideCustomContentState> interface.  \n  \n If you need to navigate through various states of a single                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>, without navigating from the                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> itself, you can use                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.IProvideCustomContentState> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationService.AddBackEntry%2A?displayProperty=fullName>.  \n  \n<a name=\"Cookies\"></a>   \n### Cookies  \n Another way that                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] applications can store data is with cookies, which are created, updated, and deleted by using the                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.SetCookie%2A> and                          <xref:System.Windows.Application.GetCookie%2A> methods.

If you don't need the overhead of creating an entire page just to display the objects, you can navigate directly to them instead.  \n  \n Consider the                          `Person` class that is implemented in the following code.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PersonClassCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/Person.cs#personclasscode)]\n [!code-vb[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PersonClassCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/VisualBasic/Person.vb#personclasscode)]  \n  \n To navigate to it, you call the                          <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow.Navigate%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, as demonstrated by the following code.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PageThatNavsToObject1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml#pagethatnavstoobject1)]  \n[!code-xml[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PageThatNavsToObject2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml#pagethatnavstoobject2)]  \n[!code-xml[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PageThatNavsToObject3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml#pagethatnavstoobject3)]  \n  \n [!code-csharp[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PageThatNavsToObjectCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/HomePage.xaml.cs#pagethatnavstoobjectcodebehind)]\n [!code-vb[NavigateToObjectSnippets#PageThatNavsToObjectCODEBEHIND](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/VisualBasic/HomePage.xaml.vb#pagethatnavstoobjectcodebehind)]  \n  \n The following figure shows the result.  \n  \n ![A page that navigates to a class](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure22.png \"NavigationOverviewFigure22\")  \n  \n From this figure, you can see that nothing useful is displayed. In fact, the value that is displayed is the return value of the                          `ToString` method for the                          **Person** object; by default, this is the only value that                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] can use to represent your object. You could override the                          `ToString` method to return more meaningful information, although it will still only be a string value. One technique you can use that takes advantage of the presentation capabilities of                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] is to use a data template. You can implement a data template that                          [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] can associate with an object of a particular type. The following code shows a data template for the                          `Person` object.  \n  \n [!code-xml[NavigateToObjectSnippets#DataTemplateMARKUP](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/NavigateToObjectSnippets/CSharp/App.xaml#datatemplatemarkup)]  \n  \n Here, the data template is associated with the                          `Person` type by using the                          `x:Type` markup extension in the                          `DataType` attribute. The data template then binds                          `TextBlock` elements (see                          <xref:System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock>) to the properties of the                          `Person` class. The following figure shows the updated appearance of the                          `Person` object.  \n  \n ![Navigating to a class that has a data template](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/app-development/media/navigationoverviewfigure23.png \"NavigationOverviewFigure23\")  \n  \n An advantage of this technique is the consistency you gain by being able to reuse the data template to display your objects consistently anywhere in your application.  \n  \n For more information on data templates, see                          [Data Templating Overview](../../../../docs/framework/wpf/data/data-templating-overview.md).  \n  \n<a name=\"Security\"></a>   \n## Security  \n [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_wpf](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-wpf-md.md)] navigation support allows                  [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xbap#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xbapsharpplural-md.md)] to be navigated to across the Internet, and it allows applications to host third-party content.
