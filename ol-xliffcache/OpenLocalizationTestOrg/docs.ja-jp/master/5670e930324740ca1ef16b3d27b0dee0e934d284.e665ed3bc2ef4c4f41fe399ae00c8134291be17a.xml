For your application to communicate with the modem, it must send commands to the appropriate serial port.  \n  \n### To dial a modem  \n  \n1.  Determine which serial port the modem is connected to. This example assumes the modem is on COM1.  \n  \n2.  Use the `My.Computer.Ports.OpenSerialPort` method to obtain a reference to the port. For more information, see <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports.OpenSerialPort%2A>.  \n  \n     The `Using` block allows the application to close the serial port even if it generates an exception. All code that manipulates the serial port should appear within this block, or within a `Try...Catch...Finally` block.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#28](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-dial-modems-attached-to-serial-ports_1.vb)]  \n  \n3.  Set the `DtrEnable` property to indicate that the computer is ready to accept an incoming transmission from the modem.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#29](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-dial-modems-attached-to-serial-ports_2.vb)]  \n  \n4.  Send the dial command and the phone number to the modem through the serial port by means of the <xref:System.IO.Ports.SerialPort.Write%2A> method.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#30](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-dial-modems-attached-to-serial-ports_3.vb)]  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#27](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to-dial-modems-attached-to-serial-ports_4.vb)]  \n  \n This code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Connectivity and Networking**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires a reference to the <xref:System?displayProperty=fullName> namespace.  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n This example assumes the modem is connected to COM1. We recommend that your code allow the user to select the desired serial port from a list of available ports. For more information, see [How to: Show Available Serial Ports](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/computer-resources/how-to-show-available-serial-ports.md).  \n  \n This example uses a `Using` block to make sure that the application closes the port even if it throws an exception. For more information, see [Using Statement](../../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/using-statement.md).  \n  \n In this example, the application disconnects the serial port after it dials the modem. Realistically, you will want to transfer data to and from the modem.
