This topic assumes you are familiar with IIS and understand how to use the IIS management tool to create and manage IIS applications. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] IIS see [Internet Information Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=132449) A [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service that runs in the IIS environment takes full advantage of IIS features, such as process recycling, idle shutdown, process health monitoring, and message-based activation. This hosting option requires that IIS be properly configured, but it does not require that any hosting code be written as part of the application. You can use IIS hosting only with an HTTP transport.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] how [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] interact, see [WCF Services and ASP.NET](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/wcf-services-and-aspnet.md). [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] configuring security, see [Security](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/security.md).  \n  \n For the source copy of this example, see [IIS Hosting Using Inline Code](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/iis-hosting-using-inline-code.md).  \n  \n### To create a service hosted by IIS  \n  \n1.  Confirm that IIS is installed and running on your computer. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] installing and configuring IIS see [Installing and Configuring IIS 7.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=132128)  \n  \n2.  Create a new folder for your application files called \"IISHostedCalcService\", ensure that [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../../../includes/vstecasp-md.md)] has access to the contents of the folder, and use the IIS management tool to create a new IIS application that is physically located in this application directory. When creating an alias for the application directory use \"IISHostedCalc\".  \n  \n3.  Create a new file named \"service.svc\" in the application directory. Edit this file by adding the following @ServiceHost element.  \n  \n    ```  \n    <%@ServiceHost language=c# Debug=\"true\" Service=\"Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples.CalculatorService\"%>  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  Create an App_Code subdirectory within the application directory.  \n  \n5.  Create a code file named Service.cs in the App_Code subdirectory.  \n  \n6.  Add the following using statements to the top of the Service.cs file.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    using System;  \n    using System.ServiceModel;  \n    ```  \n  \n7.  Add the following namespace declaration after the using statements.  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    namespace Microsoft.ServiceModel.Samples  \n    {  \n    }  \n    ```  \n  \n8.  Define the service contract inside the namespace declaration as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_HostInIIS#11](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/cs/source.cs#11)]\n     [!code-vb[c_HowTo_HostInIIS#11](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/vb/source.vb#11)]  \n  \n9. Implement the service contract after the service contract definition as shown in the following code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_HostInIIS#12](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/cs/source.cs#12)]\n     [!code-vb[c_HowTo_HostInIIS#12](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/vb/source.vb#12)]  \n  \n10. Create a file named \"Web.config\" in the application directory and add the following configuration code into the file. At runtime, the [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] infrastructure uses the information to construct an endpoint that client applications can communicate with.  \n  \n     [!code-xml[c_HowTo_HostInIIS#100](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/common/web.config#100)]      \n  \n     This example explicitly specifies endpoints in the configuration file. If you do not add any endpoints to the service, the runtime adds default endpoints for you. [!INCLUDE[crabout](../../../../includes/crabout-md.md)] default endpoints, bindings, and behaviors see [Simplified Configuration](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/simplified-configuration.md) and [Simplified Configuration for WCF Services](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/simplified-configuration-for-wcf-services.md).  \n  \n11. To make sure the service is hosted correctly, open an instance of Internet Explorer and browse to the service's URL: `http://localhost/IISHostedCalc/Service.svc`  \n  \n## Example  \n The following is a complete listing of the code for the IIS hosted calculator service.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[C_HowTo_HostInIIS#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_hostiniis/cs/source.cs#1)]
