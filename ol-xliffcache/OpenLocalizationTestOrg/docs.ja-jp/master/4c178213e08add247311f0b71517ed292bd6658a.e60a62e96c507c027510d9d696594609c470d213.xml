For instance, an application UI created in XAML can be conceptualized as an object tree. The element tree can be further divided into two discrete yet sometimes parallel trees: the logical tree and the visual tree. Serialization in WPF involves saving the state of these two trees as well as application state and writing it to a file, potentially as XAML.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Trees in WPF](trees-in-wpf.md)  \n [Serialization Limitations of XamlWriter.Save](serialization-limitations-of-xamlwriter-save.md)  \n [Initialization for Object Elements Not in an Object Tree](initialization-for-object-elements-not-in-an-object-tree.md)  \n [How-to Topics](element-tree-and-serialization-how-to-topics.md)  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Markup>  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.LogicalTreeHelper>  \n  \n <xref:System.Windows.Media.VisualTreeHelper>  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [WPF Architecture](wpf-architecture.md)  \n  [XAML in WPF](xaml-in-wpf.md)  \n  [Base Elements](base-elements.md)  \n  [Properties](properties-wpf.md)  \n  [Events](events-wpf.md)  \n  [Input](input-wpf.md)  \n  [Resources](resources-wpf.md)  \n  [Styling and Templating](../controls/styling-and-templating.md)  \n  [Threading Model](threading-model.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,253],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Element Tree and Serialization\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nf1_keywords: \n  -
