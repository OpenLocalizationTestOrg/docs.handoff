One of the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object. To draw an opaque line, set the alpha component of the color to 255. To draw a semitransparent line, set the alpha component to any value from 1 through 254.  \n  \n When you draw a semitransparent line over a background, the color of the line is blended with the colors of the background. The alpha component specifies how the line and background colors are mixed; alpha values near 0 place more weight on the background colors, and alpha values near 255 place more weight on the line color.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example draws a bitmap and then draws three lines that use the bitmap as a background. The first line uses an alpha component of 255, so it is opaque. The second and third lines use an alpha component of 128, so they are semitransparent; you can see the background image through the lines. The statement that sets the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.CompositingQuality%2A> property causes the blending for the third line to be done in conjunction with gamma correction.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.AlphaBlending#11](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlphaBlending/CS/Class1.cs#11)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.AlphaBlending#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.AlphaBlending/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  \n  \n The following illustration shows the output of the following code:  \n  \n ![Illustration that shows opaque and semitransparent output](./media/how-to-draw-opaque-and-semitransparent-lines/opaque-semitransparent-lines.png)  \n\n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs>`e`, which is a parameter of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Paint> event handler.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Alpha Blending Lines and Fills](alpha-blending-lines-and-fills.md)\n- [How to: Give Your Control a Transparent Background](../controls/how-to-give-your-control-a-transparent-background.md)\n- [How to: Draw with Opaque and Semitransparent Brushes](how-to-draw-with-opaque-and-semitransparent-brushes.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,367],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"drawing [Windows Forms], lines\"\n  - \"transparency [Windows Forms], lines\"\n  - \"lines [Windows Forms], drawing alpha blended\"\n  - \"alpha blending [Windows Forms], drawing lines\"\nms.assetid: 8f2508af-f495-4223-b5cc-646cbbb520eb","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","nodes":[{"pos":[0,45],"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","pos":[0,45]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[374,419],"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","linkify":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Draw Opaque and Semitransparent Lines","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"When you draw a line, you must pass a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen&gt;</ph> object to the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A&gt;</ph> method of the <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Graphics&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[420,592],"source":"When you draw a line, you must pass a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class."},{"content":"One of the parameters of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A&gt;</ph> constructor is a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Drawing.Color&gt;</ph> object.","pos":[593,711],"source":" One of the parameters of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.%23ctor%2A> constructor is a <xref:System.Drawing.Color> object."},{"content":"To draw an opaque line, set the alpha component of the color to 255.","pos":[712,780]},{"content":"To draw a semitransparent line, set the alpha component to any value from 1 through 254.","pos":[781,869]},{"content":"When you draw a semitransparent line over a background, the color of the line is blended with the colors of the background.","pos":[876,999]},{"content":"The alpha component specifies how the line and background colors are mixed;
