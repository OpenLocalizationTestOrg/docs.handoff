For hierarchical data access, you can use the XML classes available in the .NET Framework. Historically, these two representations of data have been used separately. However, the .NET Framework enables real-time, synchronous access to both the relational and hierarchical representations of data through the **DataSet** object and the <xref:System.Xml.XmlDataDocument> object, respectively.  \n  \n When a **DataSet** is synchronized with an **XmlDataDocument**, both objects are working with a single set of data. This means that if a change is made to the **DataSet**, the change will be reflected in the **XmlDataDocument**, and vice versa. The relationship between the **DataSet** and the **XmlDataDocument** creates great flexibility by allowing a single application, using a single set of data, to access the entire suite of services built around the **DataSet** (such as Web Forms and Windows Forms controls, and Visual Studio .NET designers), as well as the suite of XML services including Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL), XSL Transformations (XSLT), and XML Path Language (XPath). You do not have to choose which set of services to target with the application; both are available.  \n  \n There are several ways that you can synchronize a **DataSet** with an **XmlDataDocument**. You can:  \n  \n-   Populate a **DataSet** with schema (that is, a relational structure) and data and then synchronize it with a new **XmlDataDocument**. This provides a hierarchical view of existing relational data. For example:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \n  \n    ' Add code here to populate the DataSet with schema and data.  \n  \n    Dim xmlDoc As XmlDataDocument = New XmlDataDocument(dataSet)  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \n  \n    // Add code here to populate the DataSet with schema and data.  \n  \n    XmlDataDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDataDocument(dataSet);  \n    ```  \n  \n-   Populate a **DataSet** with schema only (such as a strongly typed **DataSet**), synchronize it with an **XmlDataDocument**, and then load the **XmlDataDocument** from an XML document. This provides a relational view of existing hierarchical data. The table names and column names in your **DataSet** schema must match the names of the XML elements that you want them synchronized with. This matching is case-sensitive.  \n  \n     Note that the schema of the **DataSet** only needs to match the XML elements that you want to expose in your relational view. This way, you can have a very large XML document and a very small relational \"window\" on that document. The **XmlDataDocument** preserves the entire XML document even though the **DataSet** only exposes a small portion of it. (For a detailed example of this, see [Synchronizing a DataSet with an XmlDataDocument](../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/synchronizing-a-dataset-with-an-xmldatadocument.md).)  \n  \n     The following code example shows the steps for creating a **DataSet** and populating its schema, then synchronizing it with an **XmlDataDocument**. Note that the **DataSet** schema only needs to match the elements from the **XmlDataDocument** that you want to expose using the **DataSet**.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim dataSet As DataSet = New DataSet  \n  \n    ' Add code here to populate the DataSet with schema, but not data.  \n  \n    Dim xmlDoc As XmlDataDocument = New XmlDataDocument(dataSet)  \n    xmlDoc.Load(\"XMLDocument.xml\")  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();  \n  \n    // Add code here to populate the DataSet with schema, but not data.  \n  \n    XmlDataDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDataDocument(dataSet);  \n    xmlDoc.Load(\"XMLDocument.xml\");  \n    ```  \n  \n     You cannot load an **XmlDataDocument** if it is synchronized with a **DataSet** that contains data. An exception will be thrown.  \n  \n-   Create a new **XmlDataDocument** and load it from an XML document, and then access the relational view of the data using the **DataSet** property of the **XmlDataDocument**. You need to set the schema of the **DataSet** before you can view any of the data in the **XmlDataDocument** using the **DataSet**. Again, the table names and column names in your **DataSet** schema must match the names of the XML elements that you want them synchronized with. This matching is case-sensitive.  \n  \n     The following code example shows how to access the relational view of the data in an **XmlDataDocument**.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Dim xmlDoc As XmlDataDocument = New XmlDataDocument  \n    Dim dataSet As DataSet = xmlDoc.DataSet  \n  \n    ' Add code here to create the schema of the DataSet to view the data.  \n  \n    xmlDoc.Load(\"XMLDocument.xml\")  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    XmlDataDocument xmlDoc = new XmlDataDocument();  \n    DataSet dataSet = xmlDoc.DataSet;  \n  \n    // Add code here to create the schema of the DataSet to view the data.  \n  \n    xmlDoc.Load(\"XMLDocument.xml\");  \n    ```  \n  \n Another advantage of synchronizing an **XmlDataDocument** with a **DataSet** is that the fidelity of an XML document is preserved. If the **DataSet** is populated from an XML document using **ReadXml**, when the data is written back as an XML document using **WriteXml** it may differ dramatically from the original XML document. This is because the **DataSet** does not maintain formatting, such as white space, or hierarchical information, such as element order, from the XML document. The **DataSet** also does not contain elements from the XML document that were ignored because they did not match the schema of the **Dataset**. Synchronizing an **XmlDataDocument** with a **DataSet** allows the formatting and hierarchical element structure of the original XML document to be maintained in the **XmlDataDocument**, while the **DataSet** contains only data and schema information appropriate to the **DataSet**.  \n  \n When synchronizing a **DataSet** with an **XmlDataDocument**, results may differ depending on whether or not your <xref:System.Data.DataRelation> objects are nested.
