For more information, see [Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In an application where the callback must be invoked on a specific thread, you must explicitly marshal the execution of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method. For more information, see [Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n The example in this topic uses the Northwind sample data service and autogenerated client data service classes. This service and the client data classes are created when you complete the [WCF Data Services quickstart](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/quickstart-wcf-data-services.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to execute an asynchronous query by calling the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.BeginExecute%2A> method to start the query. The inline delegate calls the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method to display the query results.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[Astoria Northwind Client#ExecuteQueryAsync](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/cs/source.cs#executequeryasync)]\n [!code-vb[Astoria Northwind Client#ExecuteQueryAsync](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Misc/astoria northwind client/vb/source.vb#executequeryasync)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [WCF Data Services Client Library](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/wcf-data-services-client-library.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,98],"content":"How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,86]}]},{"pos":[521,590],"content":"How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services)","linkify":"How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services)","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Execute Asynchronous Data Service Queries (WCF Data Services)","pos":[0,69]}]},{"content":"By using the <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)]</ph> client library, you can asynchronously perform client-server operations, such as executing queries and saving changes.","pos":[591,782],"source":"By using the [!INCLUDE[ssAstoria](../../../../includes/ssastoria-md.md)] client library, you can asynchronously perform client-server operations, such as executing queries and saving changes."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Asynchronous Operations<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md)</ept>.","pos":[783,917],"source":" For more information, see [Asynchronous Operations](../../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/asynchronous-operations-wcf-data-services.md)."},{"pos":[925,1272],"content":"[!NOTE]\n In an application where the callback must be invoked on a specific thread, you must explicitly marshal the execution of the <xref:System.Data.Services.Client.DataServiceQuery%601.EndExecute%2A> method.
