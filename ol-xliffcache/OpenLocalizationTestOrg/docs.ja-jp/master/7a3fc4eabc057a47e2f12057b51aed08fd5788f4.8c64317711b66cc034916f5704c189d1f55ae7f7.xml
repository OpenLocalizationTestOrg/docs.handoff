There are three reasons to group controls. One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To create a group of controls  \n  \n1.  Drag a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control from the **Windows Forms** tab of the Toolbox onto a form.  \n  \n2.  Add other controls to the panel, drawing each inside the panel.  \n  \n     If you have existing controls that you want to enclose in a panel, you can select all the controls, cut them to the Clipboard, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> control, and then paste them into the panel. You can also drag them into the panel.  \n  \n3.  (Optional) If you want to add a border to a panel, set its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle> property. There are three choices: <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BorderStyle>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Panel Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-windows-forms.md)   \n [Panel Control Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/panel-control-overview-windows-forms.md)   \n [How to: Set the Background of a Panel](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-set-the-background-of-a-windows-forms-panel.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,107],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,95]}]},{"pos":[601,679],"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Group Controls with the Windows Forms Panel Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,78]}]},{"content":"Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel&gt;</ph> controls are used to group other controls.","pos":[680,770],"source":"Windows Forms <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel> controls are used to group other controls."},{"content":"There are three reasons to group controls.","pos":[771,813]},{"content":"One is visual grouping of related form elements for a clear user interface; another is programmatic grouping, of radio buttons for example; the last is for moving the controls as a unit at design time.","pos":[814,1015]},{"pos":[1023,1399],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition.
