The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides the methods that actually do the drawing, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as line color, width, and style.  \n  \n## Drawing a Line  \n To draw a line, call the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method. The following example draws a line from the point (4, 2) to the point (12, 6):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#41](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#41)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#41](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#41)]  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> is an overloaded method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, so there are several ways you can supply it with arguments. For example, you can construct two <xref:System.Drawing.Point> objects and pass the <xref:System.Drawing.Point> objects as arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawLine%2A> method:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#42](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#42)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#42](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#42)]  \n  \n## Constructing a Pen  \n You can specify certain attributes when you construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object. For example, one `Pen` constructor allows you to specify color and width. The following example draws a blue line of width 2 from (0, 0) to (60, 30):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#43](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#43)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#43](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#43)]  \n  \n## Dashed Lines and Line Caps  \n The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object also exposes properties, such as <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.DashStyle%2A>, that you can use to specify features of the line. The following example draws a dashed line from (100, 50) to (300, 80):  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#44](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#44)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#44](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#44)]  \n  \n You can use the properties of the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object to set many more attributes of the line. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.StartCap%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.EndCap%2A> properties specify the appearance of the ends of the line; the ends can be flat, square, rounded, triangular, or a custom shape. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen.LineJoin%2A> property lets you specify whether connected lines are mitered (joined with sharp corners), beveled, rounded, or clipped. The following illustration shows lines with various cap and join styles.  \n  \n ![Lines](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/media/aboutgdip02-art04.gif \"Aboutgdip02_art04\")  \n  \n## Drawing a Rectangle  \n Drawing rectangles with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] is similar to drawing lines. To draw a rectangle, you need a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object and a <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object. The <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> object provides a <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawRectangle%2A> method, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object stores attributes, such as line width and color. The <xref:System.Drawing.Pen> object is passed as one of the arguments to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawRectangle%2A> method. The following example draws a rectangle with its upper-left corner at (100, 50), a width of 80, and a height of 40:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#45](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#45)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#45](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#45)]  \n  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawRectangle%2A> is an overloaded method of the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics> class, so there are several ways you can supply it with arguments. For example, you can construct a <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> object and pass the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> object to the <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics.DrawRectangle%2A> method as an argument:  \n  \n [!code-csharp[LinesCurvesAndShapes#46](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/CS/Class1.cs#46)]\n [!code-vb[LinesCurvesAndShapes#46](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/LinesCurvesAndShapes/VB/Class1.vb#46)]  \n  \n A <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle> object has methods and properties for manipulating and gathering information about the rectangle. For example, the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle.Inflate%2A> and <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle.Offset%2A> methods change the size and position of the rectangle. The <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle.IntersectsWith%2A> method tells you whether the rectangle intersects another given rectangle, and the <xref:System.Drawing.Rectangle.Contains%2A> method tells you whether a given point is inside the rectangle.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.Drawing.Pen?displayProperty=fullName>   \n
