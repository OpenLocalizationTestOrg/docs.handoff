The meaning of the [+ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md) depends on the types of `x` and `y` (addition for numeric operands, concatenation for string operands, and so forth).  \n  \n The `+=` operator cannot be overloaded directly, but user-defined types can overload the [+ operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator.md) (see [operator](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/operator.md)).  \n  \n The `+=` operator is also used to specify a method that will be called in response to an event; such methods are called event handlers. The use of the `+=` operator in this context is referred to as *subscribing to an event*.
