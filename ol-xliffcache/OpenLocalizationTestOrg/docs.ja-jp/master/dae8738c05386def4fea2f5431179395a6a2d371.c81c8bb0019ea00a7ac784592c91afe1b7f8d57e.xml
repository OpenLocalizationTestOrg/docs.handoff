The two most important reasons are to persist the state of an object to a storage medium so an exact copy can be re-created at a later stage, and to send the object by value from one application domain to another. For example, serialization is used to save session state in ASP.NET and to copy objects to the Clipboard in Windows Forms. It is also used by remoting to pass objects by value from one application domain to another.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Persistent Storage](../../../docs/framework/serialization/persistent-storage.md)  \n Describes the need for serializing an object.  \n  \n [Marshal by Value](../../../docs/framework/serialization/marshal-by-value.md)  \n Describes the marshal-by-value process.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Binary Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/binary-serialization.md)  \n Describes the binary serialization mechanism that is included with the common language runtime.  \n  \n [Remote Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/515686e6-0a8d-42f7-8188-73abede57c58)  \n Describes the various communications methods available in the .NET Framework for remote communications.  \n  \n [XML and SOAP Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/xml-and-soap-serialization.md)  \n Describes the XML and SOAP serialization mechanism that is included with the common language runtime.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,51],"content":"Serialization Concepts | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Serialization Concepts | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[373,395],"content":"Serialization Concepts","linkify":"Serialization Concepts","nodes":[{"content":"Serialization Concepts","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Why would you want to use serialization?","pos":[396,436]},{"content":"The two most important reasons are to persist the state of an object to a storage medium so an exact copy can be re-created at a later stage, and to send the object by value from one application domain to another.","pos":[437,650]},{"content":"For example, serialization is used to save session state in ASP.NET and to copy objects to the Clipboard in Windows Forms.","pos":[651,773]},{"content":"It is also used by remoting to pass objects by value from one application domain to another.","pos":[774,866]},{"pos":[875,890],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Persistent Storage<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/persistent-storage.md)</ept>","pos":[894,975],"source":"[Persistent Storage](../../../docs/framework/serialization/persistent-storage.md)"},{"content":"Describes the need for serializing an object.","pos":[979,1024]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Marshal by Value<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/marshal-by-value.md)</ept>","pos":[1031,1108],"source":"[Marshal by Value](../../../docs/framework/serialization/marshal-by-value.md)"},{"content":"Describes the marshal-by-value process.","pos":[1112,1151]},{"pos":[1160,1176],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Binary Serialization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/binary-serialization.md)</ept>","pos":[1180,1265],"source":"[Binary Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/binary-serialization.md)"},{"content":"Describes the binary serialization mechanism that is included with the common language runtime.","pos":[1269,1364]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Remote Objects<ept id=\"p1\">](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/515686e6-0a8d-42f7-8188-73abede57c58)</ept>","pos":[1371,1457],"source":"[Remote Objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/515686e6-0a8d-42f7-8188-73abede57c58)"},{"content":"Describes the various communications methods available in the .NET Framework for remote communications.","pos":[1461,1564]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>XML and SOAP Serialization<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/serialization/xml-and-soap-serialization.md)</ept>","pos":[1571,1668],"source":"[XML and SOAP Serialization](../../../docs/framework/serialization/xml-and-soap-serialization.md)"},{"content":"Describes the XML and SOAP serialization mechanism that is included with the common language runtime.","pos":[1672,1773]}]}
