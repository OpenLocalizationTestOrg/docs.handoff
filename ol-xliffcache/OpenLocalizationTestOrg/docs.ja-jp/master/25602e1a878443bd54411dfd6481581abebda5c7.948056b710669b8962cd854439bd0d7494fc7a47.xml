The IME is an essential component for writing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scripts, since these writing systems have more characters than can be encoded for a regular keyboard. For example, you may want to allow only ASCII characters in a particular text box. In such a case you can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box. The default value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A>\n) and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Globalizing Windows Forms applications](globalizing-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,656],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"Asian languages [Windows Forms], displaying with ImeMode\"\n  - \"Chinese characters [Windows Forms], displaying with ImeMode\"\n  - \"IME mode\"\n  - \"Japanese characters [Windows Forms], displaying with ImeMode\"\n  - \"international applications [Windows Forms], character display\"\n  - \"international characters\"\n  - \"Korean characters\"\n  - \"Asian languages\"\n  - \"Input Method Editor (IME), mode\"\n  - \"localization [Windows Forms], character sets\"\n  - \"globalization [Windows Forms], character sets\"\nms.assetid: c60ae399-0dab-4f07-9dea-6dbfb15ec0ae","nodes":[{"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","nodes":[{"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[663,716],"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","linkify":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","nodes":[{"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property is used by forms and controls to force a specific mode for an input method editor (IME).","pos":[717,865],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is used by forms and controls to force a specific mode for an input method editor (IME)."},{"content":"The IME is an essential component for writing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scripts, since these writing systems have more characters than can be encoded for a regular keyboard.","pos":[866,1043]},{"content":"For example, you may want to allow only ASCII characters in a particular text box.","pos":[1044,1126]},{"content":"In such a case you can set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box.","pos":[1127,1336],"source":" In such a case you can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box."},{"content":"The default value of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property is <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting.","pos":[1337,1548],"source":" The default value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting."},{"content":"For more information, see <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> ) and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1549,1664],"source":" For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A>\n) and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>."},{"pos":[1673,1681],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1685,1755],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Globalizing Windows Forms applications<ept id=\"p1\">](globalizing-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Globalizing Windows Forms applications](globalizing-windows-forms.md)"}]}
