This section contains topics that describe how to create Windows-based applications by using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or by using Windows Forms. However, you also create client applications using the .NET Framework and make them available to your users through the Windows Store and Windows Phone store for computers or devices, web applications that can be viewed in a browser.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Windows Presentation Foundation](../../docs/framework/wpf/index.md)  \n Provides information about developing applications by using WPF.  \n  \n [Windows Forms](../../docs/framework/winforms/index.md)  \n Provides information about developing applications by using Windows Forms.  \n  \n [Common Client Technologies](../../docs/framework/common-client-technologies/index.md)  \n Provides information about additional technologies that can be used when developing client applications.  \n  \n## Related
