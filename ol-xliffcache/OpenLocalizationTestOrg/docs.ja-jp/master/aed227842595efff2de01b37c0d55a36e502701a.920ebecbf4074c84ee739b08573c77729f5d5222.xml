When a method returns E_FAIL, the CLR is no longer usable within the process. Subsequent calls to hosting methods return HOST_E_CLRNOTAVAILABLE.|  \n  \n## Remarks  \n In situations where the task is close to being collected by the garbage collector, the CLR sets the value of `pbNeedsPriorityScheduling` to `true`, indicating high-priority rescheduling. This allows the host to reschedule the task quickly, thereby minimizing the potential for delays in garbage collection, and enabling the host and the runtime to cooperate in conserving memory resources.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** MSCorEE.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MSCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v20plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v20plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [ICLRTask Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtask-interface.md)   \n [ICLRTaskManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/iclrtaskmanager-interface.md)   \n [IHostTask Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttask-interface.md)   \n [IHostTaskManager Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/ihosttaskmanager-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,69],"content":"ICLRTask::NeedsPriorityScheduling Method | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"ICLRTask::NeedsPriorityScheduling Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,57]}]},{"pos":[737,777],"content":"ICLRTask::NeedsPriorityScheduling Method","linkify":"ICLRTask::NeedsPriorityScheduling Method","nodes":[{"content":"ICLRTask::NeedsPriorityScheduling Method","pos":[0,40]}]},{"content":"Gets a value that indicates whether the current task, which is being switched out, needs to be marked as a high priority for rescheduling.","pos":[778,916]},{"pos":[925,931],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1042,1052],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[out] <ph id=\"ph1\">`true`</ph>, if the host should attempt to reschedule the current task instance as soon as possible;
