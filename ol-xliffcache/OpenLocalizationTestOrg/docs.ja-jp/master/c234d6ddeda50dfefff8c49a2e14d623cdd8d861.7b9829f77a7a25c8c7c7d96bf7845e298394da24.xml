<xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method will attempt to match the `claimType` argument with all the DNS entries in its SAN field.  \n  \n## Impact  \n This change only affects apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)].  \n  \n For apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework, the <xref:System.IdentityModel.Claims.X509CertificateClaimSet.FindClaims%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method attempts to match the `claimType` argument only with the last  DNS entry.  \n  \n## Mitigation  \n If this change is undesirable, apps that target versions of the .NET Framework starting with the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] can opt out of it by adding the following configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>  \n   <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=true\" />   \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n In addition, apps that target previous versions of the .NET Framework but are running under the [!INCLUDE[net_v461](../../../includes/net-v461-md.md)] and later versions can opt in to this behavior by adding the following configuration setting to the [\\<runtime>](../../../docs/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/runtime-element.md) section of the app’s configuration file:  \n  \n```xml  \n  \n<runtime>  \n    <AppContextSwitchOverrides value=\"Switch.System.IdentityModel.DisableMultipleDNSEntriesInSANCertificate=false\" />   \n</runtime>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Retargeting
