[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] improves on [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] (the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows) by adding new features and by optimizing existing features.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] managed class interface (a set of wrappers) is part of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], an environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and other applications.  \n  \n This section provides information about the [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] API for programmers using managed code.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Lines, Curves, and Shapes](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/lines-curves-and-shapes.md)  \n Discusses vector graphics.  \n  \n [Images, Bitmaps, and Metafiles](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/images-bitmaps-and-metafiles.md)  \n Discusses the type of images available and how to work with them.  \n  \n [Coordinate Systems and Transformations](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/coordinate-systems-and-transformations.md)  \n Discusses how to transform graphics with [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)].  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Drawing.Graphics?displayProperty=fullName>  \n Describes this class and has links to all its
