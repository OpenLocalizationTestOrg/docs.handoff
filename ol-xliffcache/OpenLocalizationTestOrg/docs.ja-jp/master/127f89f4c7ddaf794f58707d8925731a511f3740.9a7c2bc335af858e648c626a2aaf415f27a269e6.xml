To re-enable function evaluation, step again or restart debugging.  \n  \n In the Visual Studio debugger, an expression specifies a procedure call, but another evaluation has timed out.  \n  \n Possible causes for a procedure call to time out include an infinite loop or *endless loop*. For more information, see [For...Next Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md).  \n  \n A special case of an infinite loop is *recursion*. For more information, see [Recursive Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/recursive-procedures.md).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30957  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  If possible, determine what the previous function evaluation was and what caused it to time out. Otherwise, you might encounter this error again.  \n  \n2.  Either step the debugger again, or terminate and restart debugging.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)   \n [Navigating through Code with the Debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,109],"content":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,97]}]},{"pos":[647,727],"content":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out","linkify":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out","nodes":[{"content":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out","pos":[0,80]}]},{"content":"Function evaluation is disabled because a previous function evaluation timed out.","pos":[728,809]},{"content":"To re-enable function evaluation, step again or restart debugging.","pos":[810,876]},{"content":"In the Visual Studio debugger, an expression specifies a procedure call, but another evaluation has timed out.","pos":[883,993]},{"content":"Possible causes for a procedure call to time out include an infinite loop or <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>endless loop<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[1000,1092],"source":"Possible causes for a procedure call to time out include an infinite loop or *endless loop*."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>For...Next Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)</ept>.","pos":[1093,1217],"source":" For more information, see [For...Next Statement](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/for-next-statement.md)."},{"content":"A special case of an infinite loop is <bpt id=\"p1\">*</bpt>recursion<ept id=\"p1\">*</ept>.","pos":[1224,1274],"source":"A special case of an infinite loop is *recursion*."},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Recursive Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/recursive-procedures.md)</ept>.","pos":[1275,1418],"source":" For more information, see [Recursive Procedures](../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/recursive-procedures.md)."},{"pos":[1425,1446],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30957","source":"**Error ID:** BC30957"},{"pos":[1455,1476],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"If possible, determine what the previous function evaluation was and what caused it to time out.","pos":[1486,1582]},{"content":"Otherwise, you might encounter this error again.","pos":[1583,1631]},{"content":"Either step the debugger again, or terminate and restart debugging.","pos":[1641,1708]},{"pos":[1717,1725],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Debugging in Visual Studio<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)</ept><ph id=\"ph1\"> </ph>","pos":[1729,1835],"source":"[Debugging in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio) "},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\"> [</bpt>Navigating through Code with the Debugger<ept id=\"p1\">](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger)</ept>","pos":[1838,1974],"source":" [Navigating through Code with the Debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger)"}]}
