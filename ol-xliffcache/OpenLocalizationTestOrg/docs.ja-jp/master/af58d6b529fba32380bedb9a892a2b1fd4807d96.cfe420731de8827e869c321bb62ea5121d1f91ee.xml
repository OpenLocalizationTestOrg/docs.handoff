Configurations vary according to a number of factors. For example, whether a service or client is on an intranet, or whether the security is provided by Windows or transport (such as HTTPS).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Internet Unsecured Client and Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/internet-unsecured-client-and-service.md)  \n An example of a public, unsecured client and service.  \n  \n [Intranet Unsecured Client and Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/intranet-unsecured-client-and-service.md)  \n A basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) service developed to provide information on a secure private network to a WCF application.  \n  \n [Transport Security with Basic Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-with-basic-authentication.md)  \n The application allows clients to log on using custom authentication.  \n  \n [Transport Security with Windows Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-with-windows-authentication.md)  \n Shows a client and service secured by Windows security.  \n  \n [Transport Security with an Anonymous Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-with-an-anonymous-client.md)  \n This scenario uses transport security (such as HTTPS) to ensure confidentiality and integrity.  \n  \n [Transport Security with Certificate Authentication](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-with-certificate-authentication.md)  \n Shows a client and service secured by a certificate.  \n  \n [Message Security with an Anonymous Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-an-anonymous-client.md)  \n Shows a client and service secured by WCF message security.  \n  \n [Message Security with a User Name Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-a-user-name-client.md)  \n The client is a Windows Forms application that allows clients to log on using a domain user name and password.  \n  \n [Message Security with a Certificate Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-a-certificate-client.md)  \n Servers have certificates, and each client has a certificate. A security context is established through Transport Layer Security (TLS) negotiation.  \n  \n [Message Security with a Windows Client](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-a-windows-client.md)  \n A variation of the certificate client. Servers have certificates, and each client has a certificate. A security context is established through TLS negotiation.  \n  \n [Message Security with a Windows Client without Credential Negotiation](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-a-windows-client-without-credential-negotiation.md)  \n Shows a client and service secured by a Kerberos domain.  \n  \n [Message Security with Mutual Certificates](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-mutual-certificates.md)  \n Servers have certificates, and each client has a certificate. The server certificate is distributed with the application and is available out of band.  \n  \n [Message Security with Issued Tokens](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/message-security-with-issued-tokens.md)  \n Federated security that enables the establishment of trust between independent domains.  \n  \n [Trusted Subsystem](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/trusted-subsystem.md)  \n A client accesses one or more Web services that are distributed across a network. The Web services access additional resources (such as databases or other Web services) that must be secured.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.ServiceModel>  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n
