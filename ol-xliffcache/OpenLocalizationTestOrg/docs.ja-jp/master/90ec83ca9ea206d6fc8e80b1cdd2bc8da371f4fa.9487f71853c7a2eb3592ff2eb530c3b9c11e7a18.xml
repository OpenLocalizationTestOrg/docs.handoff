A null reference exception could result at runtime. Make sure the structure or all the reference members are initialized before use  \n  \n A procedure call passes a structure variable as an argument to a `ByRef` parameter before any value is assigned to the variable.  \n  \n If a structure variable has never been assigned a value, each structure member holds the default value for its data type. For a reference data type, that default value is [Nothing](../../visual-basic/language-reference/nothing.md). Reading a reference member that has a value of `Nothing` can cause a <xref:System.NullReferenceException> in some circumstances.  \n  \n Passing an argument to a procedure `ByRef` exposes the variable underlying the argument to possible modification by the procedure.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning. For more information about hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, please see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](/visualstudio/ide/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic).  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC42108  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If you intend the procedure to assign values to structure members through the `ByRef` argument, and if it does not matter whether the members already hold values, then no action is necessary.  \n  \n-   If the logic in the procedure reads a structure member before assigning any value to it, and if the member is of a value type, then make sure that the procedure logic does not depend on whether the member holds its default value or not.  \n  \n-   If the logic in the procedure reads a structure member before assigning any value to it, and if the member is of a reference type, then make sure that the procedure logic can handle a value of `Nothing`. For example, it could use a [Try...Catch...Finally Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/try-catch-finally-statement.md) to catch a <xref:System.NullReferenceException>.  \n
