Open a command prompt.  \n  \n2.  Create a Visual Basic file named `friend_signed_A.` that contains the following code. The code uses the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute to declare friend_signed_B as a friend assembly.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' friend_unsigned_A.vb  \n    ' Compile with:   \n    ' Vbc /target:library friend_unsigned_A.vb  \n    Imports System.Runtime.CompilerServices  \n    Imports System  \n  \n    <Assembly: InternalsVisibleTo(\"friend_unsigned_B\")>   \n  \n    ' Friend type.  \n    Friend Class Class1  \n        Public Sub Test()  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Class1.Test\")  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \n  \n    ' Public type with Friend member.  \n    Public Class Class2  \n        Friend Sub Test()  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"Class2.Test\")  \n        End Sub  \n    End Class  \n    ```  \n  \n3.  Compile and sign friend_signed_A by using the following command.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Vbc /target:library friend_unsigned_A.vb  \n    ```  \n  \n4.  Create a Visual Basic file named `friend_unsigned_B` that contains the following code. Because friend_unsigned_A specifies friend_unsigned_B as a friend assembly, the code in friend_unsigned_B can access `Friend` types and members from friend_unsigned_A.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    ' friend_unsigned_B.vb  \n    ' Compile with:   \n    ' Vbc /r:friend_unsigned_A.dll friend_unsigned_B.vb  \n    Module Module1  \n        Sub Main()  \n            ' Access a Friend type.  \n            Dim inst1 As New Class1()  \n            inst1.Test()  \n  \n            Dim inst2 As New Class2()  \n            ' Access a Friend member of a public type.  \n            inst2.Test()  \n  \n            System.Console.ReadLine()  \n        End Sub  \n    End Module  \n    ```  \n  \n5.  Compile friend_signed_B by using the following command.  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    Vbc /r:friend_unsigned_A.dll friend_unsigned_B.vb  \n    ```  \n  \n     The name of the assembly that is generated by the compiler must match the friend assembly name that is passed to the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute. You can explicitly set the assembly by using the `/out` compiler option.  \n  \n6.  Run the friend_signed_B.exe file.  \n  \n     The program prints two strings: \"Class1.Test\" and \"Class2.Test\".  \n  \n## .NET Framework Security  \n There are similarities between the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute and the <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> class. The main difference is that <xref:System.Security.Permissions.StrongNameIdentityPermission> can demand security permissions to run a particular section of code, whereas the <xref:System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleToAttribute> attribute controls the visibility of `Friend` types and members.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
