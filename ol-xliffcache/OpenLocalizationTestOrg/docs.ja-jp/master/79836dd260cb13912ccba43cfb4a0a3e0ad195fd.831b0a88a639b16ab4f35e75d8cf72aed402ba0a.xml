This area is called custom places. The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog> classes allow you to add folders to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.CustomPlaces%2A> collection.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  In order for a custom place to appear in the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.OpenFileDialog> or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SaveFileDialog>, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.AutoUpgradeEnabled%2A> property must be set to `true` (the default).  \n  \n### To add a custom place to a file dialog box  \n  \n-   Add a path, a Known Folder GUID, or a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialogCustomPlace> object to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.FileDialog.CustomPlaces%2A> collection of the dialog box.  \n  \n     The following code example shows how to add a path:  \n  \n    ```vb  \n    OpenFileDialog1.CustomPlaces.Add(\"C:\\MyCustomPlace\")  \n    ```  \n  \n    ```csharp  \n    openFileDialog1.CustomPlaces.Add(\"C:\\\\MyCustomPlace\");
