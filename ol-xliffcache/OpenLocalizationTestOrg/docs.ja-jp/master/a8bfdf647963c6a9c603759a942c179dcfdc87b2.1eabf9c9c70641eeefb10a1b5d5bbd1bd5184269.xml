If you attempt to populate an XML tree with a large XML file, your memory usage will be proportional to the size of the file—that is, excessive. Therefore, you should use a streaming technique instead.  \n  \n One option is to write your application using <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader>. However, you might want to use [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../../../../csharp/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] to query the XML tree. If this is the case, you can write your own custom axis method. For more information, see [How to: Write a LINQ to XML Axis Method (Visual Basic)](../../../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/how-to-write-a-linq-to-xml-axis-method.md).  \n  \n To write your own axis method, you write a small method that uses the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to read nodes until it reaches one of the nodes in which you are interested. The method then calls <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNode.ReadFrom%2A>, which reads from the <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> and instantiates an XML fragment. You can then write LINQ queries on your custom axis method.  \n  \n Streaming techniques are best applied in situations where you need to process the source document only once, and you can process the elements in document order. Certain standard query operators, such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderBy%2A>, iterate their source, collect all of the data, sort it, and then finally yield the first item in the sequence. Note that if you use a query operator that materializes its source before yielding the first item, you will not retain a small memory footprint.  \n  \n## Example  \n Sometimes the problem gets just a little more interesting. In the following XML document, the consumer of your custom axis method also has to know the name of the customer that each item belongs to.  \n  \n```xml  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>  \n<Root>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>A. Datum Corporation</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0001</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0002</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0003</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0004</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>Fabrikam, Inc.</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0005</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0006</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0007</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0008</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n  <Customer>  \n    <Name>Southridge Video</Name>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0009</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n    <Item>  \n      <Key>0010</Key>  \n    </Item>  \n  </Customer>  \n</Root>  \n```  \n  \n The approach that this example takes is to also watch for this header information, save the header information, and then build a small XML tree that contains both the header information and the detail that you are enumerating. The axis method then yields this new, small XML tree. The query then has access to the header information as well as the detail information.  \n  \n This approach has a small memory footprint. As each detail XML fragment is yielded, no references are kept to the previous fragment, and it is available for garbage collection. Note that this technique creates many short lived objects on the heap.  \n  \n The following example shows how to implement and use a custom axis method that streams XML fragments from the file specified by the URI. This custom axis is specifically written such that it expects a document that has `Customer`, `Name`, and `Item` elements, and that those elements will be arranged as in the above `Source.xml` document. It is a simplistic implementation. A more robust implementation would be prepared to parse an invalid document.  \n  \n```vb  \nModule Module1  \n  \n    Sub Main()  \n        Dim xmlTree = <Root>  \n                          <%=  \n                              From el In New StreamCustomerItem(\"Source.xml\")  \n                              Let itemKey = CInt(el.<Key>.Value)  \n                              Where itemKey >= 3 AndAlso itemKey <= 7  \n                              Select <Item>  \n                                         <Customer><%= el.Parent.<Name>.Value %></Customer>  \n                                         <%= el.<Key> %>  \n                                     </Item>  \n                          %>  \n                      </Root>  \n  \n        Console.WriteLine(xmlTree)  \n    End Sub  \n  \nEnd Module  \n  \nPublic Class StreamCustomerItem  \n    Implements IEnumerable(Of XElement)  \n  \n    Private _uri As String  \n  \n    Public Sub New(ByVal uri As String)  \n        _uri = uri  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public Function GetEnumerator() As IEnumerator(Of XElement) Implements IEnumerable(Of XElement).GetEnumerator  \n        Return New StreamCustomerItemEnumerator(_uri)  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Public Function GetEnumerator1() As IEnumerator Implements IEnumerable.GetEnumerator  \n        Return Me.GetEnumerator()  \n    End Function  \nEnd Class  \n  \nPublic Class StreamCustomerItemEnumerator  \n    Implements IEnumerator(Of XElement)  \n  \n    Private _current As XElement  \n    Private _customerName As String  \n    Private _reader As Xml.XmlReader  \n    Private _uri As String  \n  \n    Public Sub New(ByVal uri As String)  \n        _uri = uri  \n        _reader = Xml.XmlReader.Create(_uri)  \n        _reader.MoveToContent()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public ReadOnly Property Current As XElement Implements IEnumerator(Of XElement).Current  \n        Get  \n            Return _current  \n        End Get  \n    End Property  \n  \n    Public ReadOnly Property Current1 As Object Implements IEnumerator.Current  \n        Get  \n            Return Me.Current  \n        End Get  \n    End Property  \n  \n    Public Function MoveNext() As Boolean Implements IEnumerator.MoveNext  \n        Dim item As XElement  \n        Dim name As XElement  \n  \n        ' Parse the file, save header information when encountered, and return the  \n        ' current Item XElement.  \n  \n        ' loop through Customer elements  \n        While _reader.Read()  \n            If _reader.NodeType = Xml.XmlNodeType.Element Then  \n                Select Case _reader.Name  \n                    Case \"Customer\"  \n                        ' move to Name element  \n                        While _reader.Read()  \n  \n                            If _reader.NodeType = Xml.XmlNodeType.Element AndAlso  \n                                _reader.Name = \"Name\" Then  \n  \n                                name = TryCast(XElement.ReadFrom(_reader), XElement)  \n                                _customerName = If(name IsNot Nothing, name.Value, \"\")  \n                                Exit While  \n                            End If  \n  \n                        End While  \n                    Case \"Item\"  \n                        item = TryCast(XElement.ReadFrom(_reader), XElement)  \n                        Dim tempRoot = <Root>  \n                                           <Name><%= _customerName %></Name>  \n                                           <%= item %>  \n                                       </Root>  \n                        _current = item  \n                        Return True  \n                End Select  \n            End If  \n        End While  \n  \n        Return False  \n    End Function  \n  \n    Public Sub Reset() Implements IEnumerator.Reset  \n        _reader = Xml.XmlReader.Create(_uri)  \n        _reader.MoveToContent()  \n    End Sub  \n  \n#Region \"IDisposable Support\"  \n    Private disposedValue As Boolean ' To detect redundant calls  \n  \n    ' IDisposable  \n    Protected Overridable Sub Dispose(ByVal disposing As Boolean)  \n        If Not Me.disposedValue Then  \n            If disposing Then  \n                _reader.Close()  \n            End If  \n        End If  \n        Me.disposedValue = True  \n    End Sub  \n  \n    Public Sub Dispose() Implements IDisposable.Dispose  \n        Dispose(True)  \n        GC.SuppressFinalize(Me)  \n    End Sub  \n#End Region  \n  \nEnd Class  \n  \n```  \n  \n This code produces the following output:  \n  \n```xml  \n<Root>  \n  <Item>  \n    <Customer>A.
