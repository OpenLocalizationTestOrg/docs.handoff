The accessor code can connect the interface event to another event in your class (shown later in this topic), or to its own delegate type. For more information, see [How to:  Implement Interface Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-implement-interface-events.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following sample generates CS0071.  \n  \n```csharp  \n// CS0071.cs  \npublic delegate void MyEvent(object sender);  \n  \ninterface ITest  \n{  \n    event MyEvent Clicked;  \n}  \n  \nclass Test : Itest  \n{  \n    event MyEvent ITest.Clicked;  // CS0071  \n  \n    // try the following code instead  \n/*  \nprivate MyEvent clicked;  \n  \n    event MyEvent Itest.Clicked  \n    {  \n        add  \n        {  \n            clicked += value;  \n        }  \n        remove  \n        {  \n            clicked -= value;  \n        }  \n    }  \n*/  \n    public static void Main() { }  \n}  \n```\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,165],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Compiler Error CS0071\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"CS0071\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"CS0071\"\nms.assetid: 787cbeae-fb2b-455a-ba10-811b956ed170","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0071","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Compiler Error CS0071","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0071","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[172,193],"content":"Compiler Error CS0071","linkify":"Compiler Error CS0071","nodes":[{"content":"Compiler Error CS0071","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"An explicit interface implementation of an event must use event accessor syntax","pos":[194,273]},{"content":"When explicitly implementing an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>event<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/event.md)</ept> that was declared in an interface, you must use manually provide the <ph id=\"ph1\">`add`</ph> and <ph id=\"ph2\">`remove`</ph> event accessors that are typically provided by the compiler.","pos":[280,522],"source":"When explicitly implementing an [event](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/event.md) that was declared in an interface, you must use manually provide the `add` and `remove` event accessors that are typically provided by the compiler."},{"content":"The accessor code can connect the interface event to another event in your class (shown later in this topic), or to its own delegate type.","pos":[523,661]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to:  Implement Interface Events<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-implement-interface-events.md)</ept>.","pos":[662,805],"source":" For more information, see [How to:  Implement Interface Events](../../../csharp/programming-guide/events/how-to-implement-interface-events.md)."},{"pos":[814,821],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following sample generates CS0071.","pos":[825,863]}]}
