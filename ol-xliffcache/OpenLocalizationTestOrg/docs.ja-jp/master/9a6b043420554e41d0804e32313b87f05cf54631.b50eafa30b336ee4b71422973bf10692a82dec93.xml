Additionally, a security token manager must be provided to leverage the multiple certificates' information and to create an appropriate security token provider for specified key usage and message direction.  \n  \n The following diagram shows the main classes used, the classes they inherit from (shown by an upward-pointing arrow), and the return types of certain methods and properties.  \n  \n-   `MyClientCredentials` is a custom implementation of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ClientCredentials>.  \n  \n    -   Its properties shown in the diagram all return instances of <xref:System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2>.  \n  \n    -   Its method <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ClientCredentials.CreateSecurityTokenManager%2A> returns an instance of `MyClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager`.  \n  \n-   `MyClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager` is a custom implementation of <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager>.  \n  \n    -   Its method <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager.CreateSecurityTokenProvider%2A> returns an instance of <xref:System.IdentityModel.Selectors.X509SecurityTokenProvider>.  \n  \n ![Chart showing how client credentials are used](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/media/e4971edd-a59f-4571-b36f-7e6b2f0d610f.gif \"e4971edd-a59f-4571-b36f-7e6b2f0d610f\")  \n  \n For more information about custom credentials, see [Walkthrough: Creating Custom Client and Service Credentials](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/walkthrough-creating-custom-client-and-service-credentials.md).  \n  \n In addition, you must create a custom identity verifier, and link it to a security binding element in a custom binding. You must also use the custom credentials instead of the default credentials.  \n  \n The following diagram shows the classes involved in the custom binding, and how the custom identity verifier is linked. There are several binding elements involved, all of which inherit from <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.BindingElement>. The <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.AsymmetricSecurityBindingElement> has the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Channels.LocalClientSecuritySettings> property, which returns an instance of <xref:System.ServiceModel.Security.IdentityVerifier>, from which `MyIdentityVerifier` is customized.  \n  \n ![Chart showing a custom binding element](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/media/dddea4a2-0bb4-4921-9bf4-20d4d82c3da5.gif \"dddea4a2-0bb4-4921-9bf4-20d4d82c3da5\")  \n  \n For more information about creating a custom identity verifier, see How to: [How to: Create a Custom Client Identity Verifier](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/extending/how-to-create-a-custom-client-identity-verifier.md).  \n  \n### To use separate certificates for signing and encryption  \n  \n1.  Define a new client credentials class that inherits from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Description.ClientCredentials> class. Implement four new properties to allow multiple certificates specification: `ClientSigningCertificate`, `ClientEncryptingCertificate`, `ServiceSigningCertificate`, and `ServiceEncryptingCertificate`.

Define a new client security token manager that inherits from the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager> class. Override the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientCredentialsSecurityTokenManager.CreateSecurityTokenProvider%2A> method to create an appropriate security token provider.
