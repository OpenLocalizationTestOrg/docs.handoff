It is commonly used to present a Yes/No or True/False selection to the user. You can use check box controls in groups to display multiple choices from which the user can select one or more. It is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> control, but any number of grouped `CheckBox` controls may be selected.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [CheckBox Control Overview](checkbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.  \n  \n [How to: Respond to Windows Forms CheckBox Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-checkbox-clicks.md)  \n Explains how to use a check box to determine your application's actions.  \n  \n [How to: Set Options with Windows Forms CheckBox Controls](how-to-set-options-with-windows-forms-checkbox-controls.md)  \n Describes how to use a check box to set options such as properties of an object.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> class  \n Describes this class and has links to all its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,406],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"checked list items [Windows Forms], Windows Forms controls\"\n  - \"CheckBox control [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"list controls [Windows Forms], Windows Forms\"\n  - \"list items [Windows Forms], Windows Forms controls that display\"\n  - \"checked list items\"\n  - \"check boxes\"\nms.assetid: 0719d798-c307-40d3-9040-72a62679c227","nodes":[{"content":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[413,445],"content":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","linkify":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"CheckBox Control (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`CheckBox`</ph> control indicates whether a particular condition is on or off.","pos":[446,537],"source":"The Windows Forms `CheckBox` control indicates whether a particular condition is on or off."},{"content":"It is commonly used to present a Yes/No or True/False selection to the user.","pos":[538,614]},{"content":"You can use check box controls in groups to display multiple choices from which the user can select one or more.","pos":[615,727]},{"content":"It is similar to the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton&gt;</ph> control, but any number of grouped <ph id=\"ph2\">`CheckBox`</ph> controls may be selected.","pos":[728,860],"source":" It is similar to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton> control, but any number of grouped `CheckBox` controls may be selected."},{"pos":[869,884],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>CheckBox Control Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](checkbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[888,959],"source":"[CheckBox Control Overview](checkbox-control-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Explains what this control is and its key features and properties.","pos":[963,1029]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Respond to Windows Forms CheckBox Clicks<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-checkbox-clicks.md)</ept>","pos":[1036,1138],"source":"[How to: Respond to Windows Forms CheckBox Clicks](how-to-respond-to-windows-forms-checkbox-clicks.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to use a check box to determine your application's actions.","pos":[1142,1214]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Set Options with Windows Forms CheckBox Controls<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-set-options-with-windows-forms-checkbox-controls.md)</ept>","pos":[1221,1339],"source":"[How to: Set Options with Windows Forms CheckBox Controls](how-to-set-options-with-windows-forms-checkbox-controls.md)"},{"content":"Describes how to use a check box to set options such as properties of an object.","pos":[1343,1423]},{"pos":[1432,1441],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox&gt;</ph> class","pos":[1445,1487],"source":"<xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox> class"},{"content":"Describes this class and has links to all its members.","pos":[1491,1545]},{"pos":[1554,1570],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1574,1645],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[1649,1740]}]}
