[!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] improves on [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdi](../../../../includes/ndptecgdi-md.md)] (the Graphics Device Interface included with earlier versions of Windows) by adding new features and by optimizing existing features.  \n  \n The [!INCLUDE[ndptecgdiplus](../../../../includes/ndptecgdiplus-md.md)] managed class interface (a set of wrappers) is part of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], an environment for building, deploying, and running XML Web services and other applications.  \n  \n This
