You should not use it in all situations that require a resizable layout. The following list describes layouts that benefit most from the use of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control:  \n  \n-   Layouts in which there are multiple parts of the form that resize proportionally to each other.  \n  \n-   Layouts that will be modified or generated dynamically at run time, such as data entry forms that have user-customizable fields added or subtracted based on preferences.  \n  \n-   Layouts that should remain at an overall fixed size. For example, you may have a dialog box that should remain smaller than 800 x 600, but you need to support localized strings.  \n  \n The following list describes layouts that do not benefit greatly from using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control:  \n  \n-   Simple data entry forms with a single column of labels and a single column of text-entry areas.  \n  \n-   Forms with a single large display area that should fill all the available space when a resize occurs. An example of this is a form that displays a single <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid> control. In this case, use anchoring, because nothing else should expand when the form is resized.  \n  \n Choose carefully which controls need to be in a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control. If you have room for your text to grow by 30% using anchoring, consider using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> property only. If you can estimate the space required by your layout, use of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Dock%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Anchor%2A> is easier than estimating the details of remaining space and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.AutoSize%2A> behavior.  \n  \n In general, when designing your layout with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control, keep the design as simple as possible.  \n  \n### Use the Document Outline Window  \n The Document Outline window gives you a tree view of your layout, which you can use to manipulate the z-order and parent-child relationships of your controls. From the **View menu**, select **Other Windows**, then select **Document Outline**.  \n  \n### Avoid Nesting  \n Avoid nesting other <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> controls within a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control. Debugging nested layouts can be difficult.  \n  \n### Avoid Visual Inheritance  \n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control does not support visual inheritance in the Windows Forms Designer. A <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel> control in a derived class appears as \"locked\" at design time.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TableLayoutPanel>\n-
