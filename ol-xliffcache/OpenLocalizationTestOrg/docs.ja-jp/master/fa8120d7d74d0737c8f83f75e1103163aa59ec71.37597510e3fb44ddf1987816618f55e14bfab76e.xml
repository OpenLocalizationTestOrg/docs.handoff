The underscore must be immediately preceded by a space and immediately followed by a line terminator (carriage return). For example:  \n  \n```  \nDim books As XDocument = _  \n    XDocument.Load(My.Application.Info.DirectoryPath & _  \n                 \"\\..\\..\\Data\\books.xml\")  \n```  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30999  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Ensure that the line continuation character (_) is the last character on a line of code.  \n  \n2.  Ensure that there is a space before the line continuation character, separating it from any other code on the line.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,280],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc30999\"\n  - \"bc30999\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC30999\"\nms.assetid: 32caf62f-52e4-4acd-b40f-5af65e42e643","nodes":[{"content":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","nodes":[{"pos":[0,119],"content":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","nodes":[{"content":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","pos":[0,119]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[287,406],"content":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","linkify":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","nodes":[{"content":"Line continuation character '_' must be preceded by at least one white space and must be the last character on the line","pos":[0,119]}]},{"content":"You can use the line-continuation character, which is an underscore (_), to break a long line of code over several lines in your file.","pos":[407,541]},{"content":"The underscore must be immediately preceded by a space and immediately followed by a line terminator (carriage return).","pos":[542,661]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[662,674]},{"pos":[828,849],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC30999","source":"**Error ID:** BC30999"},{"pos":[858,879],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Ensure that the line continuation character (_) is the last character on a line of code.","pos":[889,977]},{"content":"Ensure that there is a space before the line continuation character, separating it from any other code on the line.","pos":[987,1102]},{"pos":[1111,1119],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1123,1272],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)"}]}
