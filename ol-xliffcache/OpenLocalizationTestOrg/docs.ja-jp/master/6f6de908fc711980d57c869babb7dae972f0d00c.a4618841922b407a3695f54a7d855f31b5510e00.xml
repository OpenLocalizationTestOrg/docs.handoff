If a large number of threads must be created on a server that has limited memory, and most of those threads will use very little stack space, the server might perform better if the common language runtime does not commit the full thread stack immediately when a thread is started.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Unmanaged hosts can use the `STARTUP_DISABLE_COMMITTHREADSTACK` startup flag in the [STARTUP_FLAGS](../../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/startup-flags-enumeration.md) enumeration to accomplish the same result.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to disable the default behavior of the common language runtime, which is to commit the full thread stack on thread startup.  \n  \n```  \n<configuration>  \n   <runtime>  \n
