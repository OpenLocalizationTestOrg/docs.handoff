This sample demonstrates the following key concepts relating to `UriTemplate`:  \n  \n-   Syntax for creating templates.  \n  \n-   Instantiating URIs from a `UriTemplate` using <xref:System.UriTemplate.BindByName%2A> and <xref:System.UriTemplate.BindByPosition%2A>.  \n  \n-   <xref:System.UriTemplateTable.Match%2A>, which is the inverse operation of `BindByName` and `BindByPosition`.  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  To build the C# or Visual Basic .NET edition of the solution, follow the instructions in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  To run the sample in a single- or cross-machine configuration, follow the instructions in [Running the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/running-the-samples.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer.
