You can download the scripts from the [CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/rel/1.0.0/scripts/obtain). \n\nThe main usefulness of these scripts is in automation scenarios and non-admin installations. There are two scripts: One is a PowerShell script that works on Windows. The other script is a bash script that works on Linux/OS X. Both scripts have the same behavior. The bash script also reads PowerShell switches, so you can use PowerShell switches with the script on Linux/OS X systems. \n\nThe installation scripts download the ZIP/tarball file from the CLI build drops and proceed to install it in either the default location or in a location specified by `-InstallDir|--install-dir`. By default, the installation scripts download the SDK and install it. If you wish to only obtain the shared runtime, specify the `--shared-runtime` argument. \n\nBy default, the script adds the install location to the $PATH for the current session. Override this default behavior by specifying the `--no-path` argument. \n\nBefore running the script, install the required [dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/Documentation/prereqs.md).\n\nYou can install a specific version using the `--version` argument. The version must be specified as a 3-part version (for example, 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it defaults to the first [global.json](global-json.md) file found in the hierarchy above the folder where the script is invoked that contains the `version` property. If that isn't present, it will use the latest version.\n\nYou can also use this script to obtain the SDK or shared runtime debug binaries with debug symbols by using the `--debug` argument. If you fail to do this on first install and realize later that you need the debug symbols, you can re-run the script with the `--debug` argument and the SDK version you installed to obtain the debug symbols. \n\n## Options\n\nNote: Options are different between script implementations. \n\n### PowerShell (Windows)\n\n`-Channel <CHANNEL>`\n\nSpecifies the source channel for the installation. The values are: `future`, `preview`, and `production`. The default value is `production`.\n\n`-Version <VERSION>`\n\nSpecifies the version of CLI to install. You must specify the version as a 3-part version (for example, 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it defaults to the first [global.json](global-json.md) that contains the `version` property. If that isn't present, it will use the latest version.\n\n`-InstallDir <DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the installation path. The directory is created if it doesn't exist. The default value is *%LocalAppData%\\.dotnet*.\n\n`-Architecture <ARCHITECTURE>`\n\nArchitecture of the .NET Core binaries to install. Possible values are `auto`, `x64`, and `x86`. The default value is `auto`, which represents the currently running OS architecture.\n\n`-SharedRuntime`\n\nIf set, this switch limits installation to the shared runtime. The entire SDK isn't installed.\n\n`-DebugSymbols` (see NOTE)\n\nIf set, the installer includes debugging symbols in the installation.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `-DebugSymbols` switch is not currently avaiable but planned for a future release.\n\n`-DryRun`\n\nIf set, the script won't perform the installation; but instead, it displays what command line to use to consistently install the currently requested version of the .NET CLI. For example if you specify version `latest`, it displays a link with the specific version so that this command can be used deterministically in a build script. It also displays the binary's location if you prefer to install or download it yourself.\n\n`-NoPath`\n\nIf set, the prefix/installdir are not exported to the path for the current session. By default, the script will modify the PATH, which makes the CLI tools available immediately after install.\n\n`-AzureFeed`\n\nSpecifies the URL for the Azure feed to the installer. It isn't recommended that you change this value. The default is `https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet`.\n\n`-ProxyAddress`\n\nIf set, the installer uses the proxy when making web requests.\n\n### Bash (macOS/Linux)\n\n`dotnet-install.sh [--channel] [--version] [--install-dir] [--architecture] [--shared-runtime] [--debug-symbols] [--dry-run] [--no-path] [--verbose] [--azure-feed] [--help]`\n\n`--channel <CHANNEL>`\n\nSpecifies the source channel for the installation. The values are: `future`, `dev`, and `production`. The default value is `production`.\n\n`--version <VERSION>`\n\nSpecifies the version of CLI to install. You must specify the version as a 3-part version (for example, 1.0.0-13232). If omitted, it defaults to the first [global.json](global-json.md) that contains the `version` property. If that isn't present, it will use the latest version.\n\n`--install-dir <DIRECTORY>`\n\nSpecifies the installation path. The directory is created if it doesn't exist. The default value is `$HOME/.dotnet`.\n\n`--architecture <ARCHITECTURE>`\n\nArchitecture of the .NET Core binaries to install. Possible values are `auto`, `x64` and `amd64`. The default value is `auto`, which represents the currently running OS architecture.\n\n`--shared-runtime`\n\nIf set, this switch limits installation to the shared runtime. The entire SDK isn't installed.\n\n`--debug-symbols`\n\nIf set, the installer includes debugging symbols in the installation.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This switch is not currently avaiable but planned for a future release.\n\n`--dry-run`\n\nIf set, the script won't perform the installation; but instead, it displays what command line to use to consistently install the currently requested version of the .NET CLI. For example if you specify version `latest`, it displays a link with the specific version so that this command can be used deterministically in a build script. It also displays the binary's location if you prefer to install or download it yourself.\n\n`--no-path`\n\nIf set, the prefix/installdir are not exported to the path for the current session. By default, the script will modify the PATH, which makes the CLI tools available immediately after install.\n\n`--verbose`\n\nDisplay diagnostics information.\n\n`--azure-feed`\n\nSpecifies the URL for the Azure feed to the installer. It isn't recommended that you change this value. The default is `https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet`.\n\n`--help`\n\nPrints out help for the script.\n\n## Examples\n\nInstall the latest development version to the default location:\n\nWindows:\n\n`./dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel Future`\n\nmacOS/Linux:\n\n`./dotnet-install.sh --channel Future`\n\nInstall the latest preview to the specified location:\n\nWindows:\n\n`./dotnet-install.ps1 -Channel preview -InstallDir C:\\cli`\n\nmacOS/Linux:\n\n`./dotnet-install.sh --channel preview --install-dir ~/cli`","nodes":[{"pos":[11,50],"content":"dotnet-install scripts | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-install scripts | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,39]}]},{"pos":[64,161],"content":"Learn about the dotnet-install scripts to install the .NET Core CLI tools and the shared runtime.","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Learn about the dotnet-install scripts to install the .NET Core CLI tools and the shared runtime.","pos":[0,97]}]},{"pos":[173,222],"content":"dotnet-install, dotnet-install scripts, .NET Core","needQuote":true,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-install, dotnet-install scripts, .NET Core","pos":[0,49]}]},{"pos":[418,450],"content":"dotnet-install scripts reference","linkify":"dotnet-install scripts reference","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet-install scripts reference","pos":[0,32]}]},{"pos":[455,459],"content":"Name","linkify":"Name","nodes":[{"content":"Name","pos":[0,4]}]},{"pos":[461,601],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet-install.ps1`</ph><ph id=\"ph2\"> | </ph><ph id=\"ph3\">`dotnet-install.sh`</ph> - Script used to install the .NET Core Command-line Interface (CLI) tools and the shared runtime.","source":"`dotnet-install.ps1` | `dotnet-install.sh` - Script used to install the .NET Core Command-line Interface (CLI) tools and the shared runtime."},{"pos":[606,614],"content":"Synopsis","linkify":"Synopsis","nodes":[{"content":"Synopsis","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Windows:","pos":[616,624]},{"content":"macOS/Linux:","pos":[782,794]},{"pos":[974,985],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet-install`</ph> scripts are used to perform a non-admin install of the CLI toolchain and the shared runtime.","pos":[987,1100],"source":"The `dotnet-install` scripts are used to perform a non-admin install of the CLI toolchain and the shared runtime."},{"content":"You can download the scripts from the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>CLI GitHub repo<ept id=\"p1\">](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/rel/1.0.0/scripts/obtain)</ept>.","pos":[1101,1218],"source":" You can download the scripts from the [CLI GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/rel/1.0.0/scripts/obtain)."},{"content":"The main usefulness of these scripts is in automation scenarios and non-admin installations.","pos":[1221,1313]},{"content":"There are two scripts: One is a PowerShell script that works on Windows.","pos":[1314,1386]},{"content":"The other script is a bash script that works on Linux/OS X.
