The term \"cloud\" is synonymous with \"peer mesh\" and \"peer-to-peer graph\".  \n  \n Communication between nodes should never cross from one cloud to another. A <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> instance is uniquely identified by its name, which is case-sensitive. A single peer or node may be connected to more than one cloud.  \n  \n Clouds are tied very closely to network interfaces.  On a multi-homed machine with two network cards attached to different subnets, three clouds will be returned: one for each of the link local addresses per interface, and a single global scope cloud.  \n  \n PNRP uses three cloud \"scopes\", in which a scope is a grouping of computers that are able to find each other:  \n  \n-   The global cloud corresponds to the global IPv6 address scope and global addresses and represents all the computers on the entire IPv6 Internet. There is only a single global cloud.  \n  \n-   The link-local cloud corresponds to the link-local IPv6 address scope and link-local addresses. A link-local cloud is for a specific link, which is typically the same as the locally attached subnet. There can be multiple link-local clouds.  \n  \n A third cloud, the site-specific cloud, corresponds to the site IPv6 address scope and site-local addresses. This cloud has been deprecated, although it is still supported in PNRP.  \n  \n## Clouds  \n PNRP clouds are represented by instances of the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> class. Groups of clouds used a peer are represented by instances of the enumerable <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.CloudCollection> class. Collections of PNRP clouds known to the current peer can be obtained by calling the static <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud.GetAvailableClouds%2A> method.  \n  \n Individual clouds have unique names, represented as a 256 character Unicode string. These names, along with the above-mentioned scope, are used to construct unique instances of the Cloud class. These instances can be serialized and reconstructed for persistent usage.  \n  \n Once a Cloud instance is created or obtained, peer names can be registered with it to create a mesh of known peers.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud>\n- [Peer Name Resolution Protocol](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/peer-name-resolution-protocol.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,95],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"PNRP Clouds\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: a82e2bf1-62ab-4c2d-83f3-3217a6aead2e","nodes":[{"content":"PNRP Clouds","nodes":[{"pos":[0,11],"content":"PNRP Clouds","nodes":[{"content":"PNRP Clouds","pos":[0,11]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[102,113],"content":"PNRP Clouds","linkify":"PNRP Clouds","nodes":[{"content":"PNRP Clouds","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"A PNRP \"cloud\" represents a set of nodes that can communicate with each other through the network.","pos":[114,212]},{"content":"The term \"cloud\" is synonymous with \"peer mesh\" and \"peer-to-peer graph\".","pos":[213,286]},{"content":"Communication between nodes should never cross from one cloud to another.","pos":[293,366]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud&gt;</ph> instance is uniquely identified by its name, which is case-sensitive.","pos":[367,473],"source":" A <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> instance is uniquely identified by its name, which is case-sensitive."},{"content":"A single peer or node may be connected to more than one cloud.","pos":[474,536]},{"content":"Clouds are tied very closely to network interfaces.","pos":[543,594]},{"content":"On a multi-homed machine with two network cards attached to different subnets, three clouds will be returned: one for each of the link local addresses per interface, and a single global scope cloud.","pos":[596,794]},{"content":"PNRP uses three cloud \"scopes\", in which a scope is a grouping of computers that are able to find each other:","pos":[801,910]},{"content":"The global cloud corresponds to the global IPv6 address scope and global addresses and represents all the computers on the entire IPv6 Internet.","pos":[920,1064]},{"content":"There is only a single global cloud.","pos":[1065,1101]},{"content":"The link-local cloud corresponds to the link-local IPv6 address scope and link-local addresses.","pos":[1111,1206]},{"content":"A link-local cloud is for a specific link, which is typically the same as the locally attached subnet.","pos":[1207,1309]},{"content":"There can be multiple link-local clouds.","pos":[1310,1350]},{"content":"A third cloud, the site-specific cloud, corresponds to the site IPv6 address scope and site-local addresses.","pos":[1357,1465]},{"content":"This cloud has been deprecated, although it is still supported in PNRP.","pos":[1466,1537]},{"pos":[1546,1552],"content":"Clouds","linkify":"Clouds","nodes":[{"content":"Clouds","pos":[0,6]}]},{"content":"PNRP clouds are represented by instances of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[1556,1645],"source":"PNRP clouds are represented by instances of the <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud> class."},{"content":"Groups of clouds used a peer are represented by instances of the enumerable <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.CloudCollection&gt;</ph> class.","pos":[1646,1773],"source":" Groups of clouds used a peer are represented by instances of the enumerable <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.CloudCollection> class."},{"content":"Collections of PNRP clouds known to the current peer can be obtained by calling the static <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud.GetAvailableClouds%2A&gt;</ph> method.","pos":[1774,1929],"source":" Collections of PNRP clouds known to the current peer can be obtained by calling the static <xref:System.Net.PeerToPeer.Cloud.GetAvailableClouds%2A> method."},{"content":"Individual clouds have unique names, represented as a 256 character Unicode string.","pos":[1936,2019]},{"content":"These names, along with the above-mentioned scope, are used to construct unique instances of the Cloud class.","pos":[2020,2129]},{"content":"These instances can be serialized and reconstructed for persistent usage.","pos":[2130,2203]},{"content":"Once a Cloud instance is created or obtained, peer names can be registered with it to create a mesh of known peers.","pos":[2210,2325]},{"pos":[2334,2342],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2383,2492],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Peer Name Resolution Protocol<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/peer-name-resolution-protocol.md)</ept>","source":"[Peer Name Resolution Protocol](../../../docs/framework/network-programming/peer-name-resolution-protocol.md)"}]}
