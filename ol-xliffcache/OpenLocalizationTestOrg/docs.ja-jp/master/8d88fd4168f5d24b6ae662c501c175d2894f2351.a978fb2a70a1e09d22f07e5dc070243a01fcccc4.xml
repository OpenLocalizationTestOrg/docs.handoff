First, it provides a layer of indirection when binding the controls on a form to data. This is accomplished by binding the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to your data source, and then binding the controls on your form to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component. All further interaction with the data, including navigating, sorting, filtering, and updating, is accomplished with calls to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n Second, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component can act as a strongly typed data source. Adding a type to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component with the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.Add%2A> method creates a list of that type.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [BindingSource Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/bindingsource-component-overview.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, which allows you to bind a data source to a control.  \n  \n [How to: Bind Windows Forms Controls to DBNull Database Values](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-bind-windows-forms-controls-to-dbnull-database-values.md)  \n Shows how to handle a <xref:System.DBNull> value from the data source using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n [How to: Sort and Filter ADO.NET Data with the Windows Forms BindingSource Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/sort-and-filter-ado-net-data-with-wf-bindingsource-component.md)  \n Demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to apply sorts and filters to displayed data.  \n  \n [How to: Bind to a Web Service Using the Windows Forms BindingSource](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-bind-to-a-web-service-using-the-windows-forms-bindingsource.md)  \n Shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind to a Web service.  \n  \n [How to: Handle Errors and Exceptions that Occur with Databinding](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-handle-errors-and-exceptions-that-occur-with-databinding.md)  \n Demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>

Type](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-type.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind to a type.  \n  \n [How to: Bind a Windows Forms Control to a Factory Object](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-bind-a-windows-forms-control-to-a-factory-object.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to bind to a factory object or method.  \n  \n [How to: Customize Item Addition with the Windows Forms BindingSource](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-customize-item-addition-with-the-windows-forms-bindingsource.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to create new items and add them to a data source.  \n  \n [How to: Raise Change Notifications Using the BindingSource ResetItem Method](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-raise-change-notifications-using-the-bindingsource-resetitem-method.md)  \n Demonstrates using a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component to raise change-notification events for data sources that do not support change notification.  \n  \n [How to: Raise Change Notifications Using a BindingSource and the INotifyPropertyChanged Interface](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/raise-change-notifications--bindingsource.md)  \n Demonstrates how to use a type that inherits from the <xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged> with a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> control.  \n  \n [How to: Reflect Data Source Updates in a Windows Forms Control with the BindingSource](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/reflect-data-source-updates-in-a-wf-control-with-the-bindingsource.md)  \n Demonstrates how to respond to changes in the data source using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component.  \n  \n [How to: Share Bound Data Across Forms Using the BindingSource Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-share-bound-data-across-forms-using-the-bindingsource-component.md)  \n Shows how to use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> to bind multiple forms to the same data source.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>  \n Provides reference documentation for the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>
