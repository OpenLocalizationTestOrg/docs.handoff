That means every type from which it inherits, directly or indirectly, must be compliant. Similarly, if a class implements one or more interfaces, they must all be compliant throughout their inheritance hierarchies.  \n  \n When you apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  \n  \n If you do not apply the <xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  \n  \n By default, this message is a warning.
