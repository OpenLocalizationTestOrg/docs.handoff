Each instance is instantiated on demand. You can access these Web services through the properties of the `My.WebServices` object. The name of the property is the same as the name of the Web service that the property accesses. Any class that inherits from <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol> is a Web service.  \n  \n## Tasks  \n The following table lists possible ways to access Web services referenced by an application.  \n  \n|To|See|  \n|---|---|   \n|Call a Web service|[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)|  \n|Call a Web service asynchronously and handle an event when it completes|[How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)|  \n  \n## See Also  \n [My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,78],"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,66]}]},{"pos":[663,712],"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","linkify":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","nodes":[{"content":"Accessing Application Web Services (Visual Basic)","pos":[0,49]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.WebServices`</ph> object provides an instance of each Web service referenced by the current project.","pos":[713,816],"source":"The `My.WebServices` object provides an instance of each Web service referenced by the current project."},{"content":"Each instance is instantiated on demand.","pos":[817,857]},{"content":"You can access these Web services through the properties of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`My.WebServices`</ph> object.","pos":[858,946],"source":" You can access these Web services through the properties of the `My.WebServices` object."},{"content":"The name of the property is the same as the name of the Web service that the property accesses.","pos":[947,1042]},{"content":"Any class that inherits from <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol&gt;</ph> is a Web service.","pos":[1043,1149],"source":" Any class that inherits from <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol> is a Web service."},{"pos":[1158,1163],"content":"Tasks","linkify":"Tasks","nodes":[{"content":"Tasks","pos":[0,5]}]},{"content":"The following table lists possible ways to access Web services referenced by an application.","pos":[1167,1259]},{"content":"To","pos":[1266,1268]},{"content":"See","pos":[1269,1272]},{"content":"Call a Web service","pos":[1290,1308]},{"pos":[1309,1407],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>My.WebServices Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)</ept>","source":"[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)"},{"content":"Call a Web service asynchronously and handle an event when it completes","pos":[1412,1483]},{"pos":[1484,1622],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Call a Web Service Asynchronously](../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/how-to-call-a-web-service-asynchronously.md)"},{"pos":[1632,1640],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1644,1742],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>My.WebServices Object<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)</ept>","source":"[My.WebServices Object](../../../visual-basic/language-reference/objects/my-webservices-object.md)"}]}
