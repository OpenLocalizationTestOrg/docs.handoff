This dependency is automatically installed for you if you use the .NET Core installer. However, you need to manually install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53840) if you are installing .NET Core via the [installer script](./tools/dotnet-install-script.md) or deploying a self-contained .NET Core application.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> <em>For Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 machines only:</em><br>\n> Make sure that your Windows installation is up-to-date and includes hotfix [KB2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2533623) installed through Windows Update.\n\n## Prerequisites with Visual Studio 2017\n\nYou can use any editor of your choice to develop .NET Core applications using the .NET Core SDK. However, if you want to develop .NET Core applications on Windows in an integrated development environment, you can use [Visual Studio 2017](#visual-studio-2017).\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Even though, it's possible to use Visual Studio 2015 with a preview version of the .NET Core tooling, these projects will be *project.json*-based, which is now deprecated. Visual Studio 2017 uses project files based on MSBuild. For more information about the format changes, see [High-level overview of changes](./tools/cli-msbuild-architecture.md).\n\nTo use Visual Studio 2017 to develop .NET Core apps, you'll need to have the latest version of Visual Studio installed with the **.NET Core cross-platform development** toolset (in the **Other Toolsets** section) selected.\n![Screenshot of Visual Studio 2017 installation with the \".NET Core cross-platform development\" workload selected](./media/windows-prerequisites/vs_workloads.jpg)\n\nThere are different editions of Visual Studio 2017. You can download [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) for free to get started.  To learn more about the Visual Studio installation process, see [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio).\n\nTo verify that you're running the latest version of Visual Studio 2017, do the following:\n\n * On the **Help** menu, choose **About Microsoft Visual Studio**.\n * In the **About Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog, the version number should be 15.0.26228.4 or higher.\n\nYou can read more about the changes in Visual Studio 2017 in the [release notes](https://www.visualstudio.com/news/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes).","nodes":[{"pos":[11,66],"content":"Prerequisites for .NET Core on Windows | Microsoft
