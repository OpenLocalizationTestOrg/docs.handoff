Doing so will provide access to the improvements and enhancements of the new version. However, it will also allow for the possibility of using ASP.NET 2.0 components together with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] components in the same application.  \n  \n## Protocols  \n Use ASP.NET 2.0’s new facility for validating conformity to the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1:  \n  \n```  \n[WebService(Namespace = \"http://tempuri.org/\")]  \n[WebServiceBinding(  \n     ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1,  \n     EmitConformanceClaims=true)]  \npublic interface IEcho  \n  \n```  \n  \n ASP.NET Web services that conform to WS-I Basic Profile 1.1 will be interoperable with [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] clients by using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] predefined binding, <xref:System.ServiceModel.BasicHttpBinding>.  \n  \n## Service Development  \n Avoid using the <xref:System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentServiceAttribute> attribute to have messages routed to methods based on the fully-qualified name of the body element of the SOAP message rather than the SOAPAction HTTP header. [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] uses the SOAPAction HTTP header for routing messages.  \n  \n## Data Representation  \n The XML into which <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer> serializes a type by default is semantically identical to the XML into which the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractSerializer> serializes a type, provided the namespace for the XML is explicitly defined. When defining a data type for use with ASP.NET Web services in anticipation of adopting [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] in the future, do the following:  \n  \n1.  Define the type using .NET Framework classes rather than XML Schema.  \n  \n2.  Add only the <xref:System.SerializableAttribute> and the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization.XmlRootAttribute> to the class, using the latter to explicitly define the namespace for the type. Do no add additional attributes from the <xref:System.Xml.Serialization> namespace to control how the .NET Framework class is to be translated into XML.  \n  \n By adopting this approach, you should be able to later make the .NET classes into data contracts with the addition of the <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataContractAttribute> and <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.DataMemberAttribute> without significantly altering the XML into which the classes are serialized for transmission. The types used in messages by ASP.NET Web services will be able to be processed as data contracts by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications, yielding, amongst other benefits, better performance in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] applications.  \n  \n## Security  \n Avoid using the authentication options provided by Internet Information Services (IIS). [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] clients do not support them. If a service needs to be secured, use the options provided by [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)], because these options are richer and are based on standard protocols.  \n  \n##
