Enumeration\nIndicates the equivalence of two assembly identities, as determined by the [CompareAssemblyIdentity](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/fusion/compareassemblyidentity-function.md) function.  \n  \n## Syntax  \n  \n```  \ntypedef enum _tagAssemblyComparisonResult {  \n    ACR_Unknown,   \n    ACR_EquivalentFullMatch,  \n    ACR_EquivalentWeakNamed,  \n    ACR_EquivalentFXUnified,  \n    ACR_EquivalentUnified,    \n    ACR_NonEquivalentVersion,  \n    ACR_NonEquivalent,      \n    ACR_EquivalentPartialMatch,  \n    ACR_EquivalentPartialWeakNamed,    \n    ACR_EquivalentPartialUnified,  \n    ACR_EquivalentPartialFXUnified,  \n    ACR_NonEquivalentPartialVersion    \n} AssemblyComparisonResult;  \n```  \n  \n## Members  \n  \n|Member name|Description|  \n|-----------------|-----------------|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentFullMatch`|Indicates that all assembly fields in the comparison match.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentFXUnified`|Indicates that assemblies are considered equivalent based on the common language runtime version (CLR) unification of assembly version numbers in the .NET Framework version 2.0.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentPartialFXUnified`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies based on the CLR unification of assembly version numbers in the .NET Framework 2.0.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentPartialMatch`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentPartialUnified`|Indicates a partial match of the assemblies based on legacy unification of version numbers.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentPartialWeakNamed`|Indicates a partial match of simply named assemblies.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentUnified`|Indicates that assemblies are considered equivalent based on the CLR unification of version numbers in legacy versions of the .NET Framework.|  \n|`ACR_EquivalentWeakNamed`|Indicates a match between two simply named assemblies whose version numbers were ignored.|  \n|`ACR_NonEquivalent`|Indicates that no match occurred between the two assemblies.|  \n|`ACR_NonEquivalentPartialVersion`|Indicates that the two assemblies match except for their version numbers, which match only partially.|  \n|`ACR_NonEquivalentVersion`|Indicates that the two assemblies match except for their version numbers, which do not match.|  \n|`ACR_Unknown`|Indicates that the reason for non-equivalency is not known.|  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:**
