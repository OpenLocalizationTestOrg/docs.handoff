Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box. You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a specified page range, or print a selection. By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [PrintDialog Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)  \n Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintDialog` component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings.  \n  \n [How to: Display the PrintDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)  \n Explains how to display the dialog and where it saves properties.  \n  \n## Reference  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PrintDialog>  \n Provides reference information on the class and its members.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)  \n Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,66],"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]},{"pos":[687,724],"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","linkify":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","nodes":[{"content":"PrintDialog Component (Windows Forms)","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The Windows Forms <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintDialog`</ph> component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications.","pos":[725,924],"source":"The Windows Forms `PrintDialog` component is a pre-configured dialog box used to select a printer, choose the pages to print, and determine other print-related settings in Windows-based applications."},{"content":"Use it as a simple solution for printer and print-related settings selection in lieu of configuring your own dialog box.","pos":[925,1045]},{"content":"You can enable users to print many parts of their documents: print all, print a specified page range, or print a selection.","pos":[1046,1169]},{"content":"By relying on standard Windows dialog boxes, you create applications whose basic functionality is immediately familiar to users.","pos":[1170,1298]},{"pos":[1307,1322],"content":"In This Section","linkify":"In This Section","nodes":[{"content":"In This Section","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>PrintDialog Component Overview<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[1326,1452],"source":"[PrintDialog Component Overview](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/printdialog-component-overview-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Introduces the general concepts of the <ph id=\"ph1\">`PrintDialog`</ph> component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings.","pos":[1456,1676],"source":" Introduces the general concepts of the `PrintDialog` component, which allows you to display a pre-configured dialog box that users can use to select a printer, choose pages to print, and determine print-related settings."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Display the PrintDialog Component<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)</ept>","pos":[1683,1816],"source":"[How to: Display the PrintDialog Component](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-display-the-printdialog-component.md)"},{"content":"Explains how to display the dialog and where it saves properties.","pos":[1820,1885]},{"pos":[1894,1903],"content":"Reference","linkify":"Reference","nodes":[{"content":"Reference","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"Provides reference information on the class and its members.","pos":[1950,2010]},{"pos":[2019,2035],"content":"Related Sections","linkify":"Related Sections","nodes":[{"content":"Related Sections","pos":[0,16]}]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Controls to Use on Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)</ept>","pos":[2039,2155],"source":"[Controls to Use on Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/controls-to-use-on-windows-forms.md)"},{"content":"Provides a complete list of Windows Forms controls, with links to information on their use.","pos":[2159,2250]}]}
