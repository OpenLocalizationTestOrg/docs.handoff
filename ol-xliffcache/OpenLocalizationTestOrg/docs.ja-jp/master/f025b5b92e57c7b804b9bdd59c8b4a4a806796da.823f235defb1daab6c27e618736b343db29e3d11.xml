The options are all the same. For more information about the available options, see the [MSBuild Command-Line Reference](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference).\n\nThe [dotnet build](dotnet-build.md) command is equivalent to `dotnet msbuild -restore -target:Build`. `dotnet build` is more commonly used for building projects, but `dotnet msbuild` gives you more control. For example, if you have a specific target you want to run (without running the build target), you probably want to use `dotnet msbuild`.\n\n## Examples\n\n* Build a project and its dependencies:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet msbuild\n  ```\n\n* Build a project and its dependencies using Release configuration:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet msbuild -p:Configuration=Release\n  ```\n\n* Run the publish target and publish for the `osx.10.11-x64` RID:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet msbuild -t:Publish -p:RuntimeIdentifiers=osx.10.11-x64\n  ```\n\n* See the whole project with all targets included by the SDK:\n\n  ```console\n  dotnet msbuild -pp\n  ```","nodes":[{"pos":[4,138],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: dotnet msbuild command\ndescription: The dotnet msbuild command provides access to the MSBuild command line.\nms.date: 12/03/2018","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet msbuild command","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"dotnet msbuild command","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet msbuild command","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false},{"content":"The dotnet msbuild command provides access to the MSBuild command line.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,71],"content":"The dotnet msbuild command provides access to the MSBuild command line.","nodes":[{"content":"The dotnet msbuild command provides access to the MSBuild command line.","pos":[0,71]}]}],"path":["description"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[145,159],"content":"dotnet msbuild","linkify":"dotnet msbuild","nodes":[{"content":"dotnet msbuild","pos":[0,14]}]},{"pos":[258,262],"content":"Name","linkify":"Name","nodes":[{"content":"Name","pos":[0,4]}]},{"pos":[264,328],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet msbuild`</ph> - Builds a project and all of its dependencies.","source":"`dotnet msbuild` - Builds a project and all of its dependencies."},{"pos":[333,341],"content":"Synopsis","linkify":"Synopsis","nodes":[{"content":"Synopsis","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[389,400],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"pos":[402,475],"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet msbuild`</ph> command allows access to a fully functional MSBuild.","source":"The `dotnet msbuild` command allows access to a fully functional MSBuild."},{"content":"The command has the exact same capabilities as the existing MSBuild command-line client for SDK-style project only.","pos":[477,592]},{"content":"The options are all the same.","pos":[593,622]},{"content":"For more information about the available options, see the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>MSBuild Command-Line Reference<ept id=\"p1\">](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference)</ept>.","pos":[623,768],"source":" For more information about the available options, see the [MSBuild Command-Line Reference](/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference)."},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>dotnet build<ept id=\"p1\">](dotnet-build.md)</ept> command is equivalent to <ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet msbuild -restore -target:Build`</ph>.","pos":[770,871],"source":"The [dotnet build](dotnet-build.md) command is equivalent to `dotnet msbuild -restore -target:Build`."},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet build`</ph> is more commonly used for building projects, but <ph id=\"ph2\">`dotnet msbuild`</ph> gives you more control.","pos":[872,976],"source":"`dotnet build` is more commonly used for building projects, but `dotnet msbuild` gives you more control."},{"content":"For example, if you have a specific target you want to run (without running the build target), you probably want to use <ph id=\"ph1\">`dotnet msbuild`</ph>.","pos":[977,1114],"source":" For example, if you have a specific target you want to run (without running the build target), you probably want to use `dotnet msbuild`."},{"pos":[1119,1127],"content":"Examples","linkify":"Examples","nodes":[{"content":"Examples","pos":[0,8]}]},{"content":"Build a project and its dependencies:","pos":[1131,1168]},{"content":"Build a project and its dependencies using Release configuration:","pos":[1209,1274]},{"pos":[1340,1403],"content":"Run the publish target and publish for the <ph id=\"ph1\">`osx.10.11-x64`</ph> RID:","source":"Run the publish target and publish for the `osx.10.11-x64` RID:"},{"content":"See the whole project with all targets included by the SDK:","pos":[1491,1550]}]}
