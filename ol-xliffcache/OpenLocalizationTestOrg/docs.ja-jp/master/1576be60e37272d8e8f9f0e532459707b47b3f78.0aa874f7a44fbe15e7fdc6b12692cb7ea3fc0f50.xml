A symbol remains defined in a source file until an [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md) directive in the source file removes the definition. When you use the /define option, an `#undef` directive in one file has no effect on other source code files in the project.  \n  \n You can use symbols created by this option with [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md), [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md), [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md), and [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md) to compile source files conditionally.  \n  \n **/d** is the short form of **/define**.  \n  \n You can define multiple symbols with **/define** by using a semicolon or comma to separate symbol names. For example:  \n  \n```  \n/define:DEBUG;TUESDAY  \n```  \n  \n The C# compiler itself defines no symbols or macros that you can use in your source code; all symbol definitions must be user-defined.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The C# `#define` does not allow a symbol to be given a value, as in languages such as C++. For example, `#define` cannot be used to create a macro or to define a constant. If you need to define a constant, use an `enum` variable. If you want to create a C++ style macro, consider alternatives such as generics. Since macros are notoriously error-prone, C# disallows their use but provides safer alternatives.  \n  \n### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment  \n  \n1.  Open the project's **Properties** page.  \n  \n2.  On the **Build** tab, type the symbol that is to be defined in the **Conditional compilation symbols** box. For example, if you are using the code example that follows, just type `xx` into the text box.  \n  \n For information on how to set this compiler option programmatically, see <xref:VSLangProj80.CSharpProjectConfigurationProperties3.DefineConstants%2A>.  \n  \n## Example  \n  \n```  \n// preprocessor_define.cs  \n// compile with: /define:xx  \n// or uncomment the next line  \n// #define xx  \nusing System;  \npublic class Test   \n{  \n    public static void Main()   \n    {  \n        #if (xx)   \n            Console.WriteLine(\"xx defined\");  \n        #else  \n            Console.WriteLine(\"xx not defined\");  \n        #endif  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)   \n [NIB How to: Modify Project Properties and Configuration Settings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e7184bc5-2f2b-4b4f-aa9a-3ecfcbc48b67)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"-define (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,46]}]},{"pos":[724,753],"content":"/define (C# Compiler Options)","linkify":"/define (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"/define (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,29]}]},{"pos":[754,842],"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/define<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> option defines <ph id=\"ph1\">`name`</ph> as a symbol in all source code files your program.","source":"The **/define** option defines `name` as a symbol in all source code files your program."},{"pos":[851,857],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[904,913],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`name`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`name2`</ph>","pos":[917,932],"source":"`name`, `name2`"},{"content":"The name of one or more symbols that you want to define.","pos":[936,992]},{"pos":[1001,1008],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/define<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> option has the same effect as using a <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>#define<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md)</ept> preprocessor directive except that the compiler option is in effect for all files in the project.","pos":[1012,1256],"source":"The **/define** option has the same effect as using a [#define](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-define.md) preprocessor directive except that the compiler option is in effect for all files in the project."},{"content":"A symbol remains defined in a source file until an <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#undef<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md)</ept> directive in the source file removes the definition.","pos":[1257,1451],"source":" A symbol remains defined in a source file until an [#undef](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-undef.md) directive in the source file removes the definition."},{"content":"When you use the /define option, an <ph id=\"ph1\">`#undef`</ph> directive in one file has no effect on other source code files in the project.","pos":[1452,1575],"source":" When you use the /define option, an `#undef` directive in one file has no effect on other source code files in the project."},{"pos":[1582,2029],"content":"You can use symbols created by this option with <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>#if<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md)</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>#else<ept id=\"p2\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md)</ept>, <bpt id=\"p3\">[</bpt>#elif<ept id=\"p3\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md)</ept>, and <bpt id=\"p4\">[</bpt>#endif<ept id=\"p4\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md)</ept> to compile source files conditionally.","source":"You can use symbols created by this option with [#if](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if.md), [#else](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-else.md), [#elif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-elif.md), and [#endif](../../../csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-endif.md) to compile source files conditionally."},{"pos":[2036,2076],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/d<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> is the short form of <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>/define<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"**/d** is the short form of **/define**."},{"content":"You can define multiple symbols with <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>/define<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> by using a semicolon or comma to separate symbol names.","pos":[2083,2187],"source":"You can define multiple symbols with **/define** by using a semicolon or comma to separate symbol names."},{"content":"For example:","pos":[2188,2200]},{"content":"The C# compiler itself defines no symbols or macros that you can use in your source code;
