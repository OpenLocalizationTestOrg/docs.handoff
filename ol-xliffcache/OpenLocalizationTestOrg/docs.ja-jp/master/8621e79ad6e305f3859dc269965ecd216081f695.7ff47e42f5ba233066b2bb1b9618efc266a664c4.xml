For example, it is not uncommon for Web sites to respond to a newly logged-on user with a specialized greeting that includes the user's name. Several methods in the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder?displayProperty=nameWithType> classes allow you to dynamically construct custom strings to display in your user interface. These methods also help you perform a number of basic string operations like creating new strings from arrays of bytes, comparing the values of strings, and modifying existing strings.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Creating New Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/creating-new.md)  \n Describes basic ways to convert objects into strings and to combine strings.  \n  \n [Trimming and Removing Characters](../../../docs/standard/base-types/trimming.md)  \n Describes how to trim or remove characters in a string.  \n  \n [Padding Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/padding.md)  \n Describes how to insert characters or empty spaces into a string.  \n  \n [Comparing Strings](../../../docs/standard/base-types/comparing.md)  \n Describes how to compare the contents of two or more strings.  \n  \n [Changing Case](../../../docs/standard/base-types/changing-case.md)  \n Describes how to change the case of characters within a string.  \n  \n [Using the StringBuilder Class](../../../docs/standard/base-types/stringbuilder.md)  \n Describes how to create and modify dynamic string objects with the <xref:System.Text.StringBuilder> class.  \n  \n [How to: Perform Basic String Manipulations](../../../docs/standard/base-types/basic-manipulations.md)  \n Demonstrates the use of basic string operations.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Type Conversion in
