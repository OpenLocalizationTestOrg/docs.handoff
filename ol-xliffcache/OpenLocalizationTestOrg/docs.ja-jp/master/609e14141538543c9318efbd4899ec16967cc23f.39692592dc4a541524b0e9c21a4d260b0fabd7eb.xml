These examples do not provide a progress bar or any other user interface. If you want to provide a standard progress dialog box, see [How to: Provide a Progress Dialog Box for File Operations](how-to-provide-a-progress-dialog-box-for-file-operations.md).  \n  \n Use <xref:System.IO.FileSystemWatcher?displayProperty=nameWithType> to provide events that will enable you to calculate the progress when operating on multiple files. Another approach is to use platform invoke to call the relevant file-related methods in the Windows Shell. For information about how to perform these file operations asynchronously, see [Asynchronous File I/O](../../../standard/io/asynchronous-file-i-o.md).  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to copy files and directories.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csFilesandFolders#7](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csFilesAndFolders/CS/FileIteration.cs#7)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to move files and directories.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csFilesandFolders#8](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csFilesAndFolders/CS/FileIteration.cs#8)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following example shows how to delete files and directories.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[csFilesandFolders#9](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/csFilesAndFolders/CS/FileIteration.cs#9)]  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.IO?displayProperty=nameWithType>\n- [C# Programming Guide](../../../csharp/programming-guide/index.md)\n- [File System and the Registry (C# Programming Guide)](index.md)\n- [How to: Provide a Progress Dialog Box for File Operations](how-to-provide-a-progress-dialog-box-for-file-operations.md)\n- [File and Stream I/O](../../../standard/io/index.md)\n- [Common I/O Tasks](../../../standard/io/common-i-o-tasks.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,210],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Copy, Delete, and Move Files and Folders -
