The IME is an essential component for writing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scripts, since these writing systems have more characters than can be encoded for a regular keyboard. For example, you may want to allow only ASCII characters in a particular text box. In such a case you can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box. The default value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting. For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A>\n) and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Globalizing Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/globalizing-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,82],"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,70]}]},{"pos":[913,966],"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","linkify":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","nodes":[{"content":"Display of Asian Characters with the ImeMode Property","pos":[0,53]}]},{"content":"The <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property is used by forms and controls to force a specific mode for an input method editor (IME).","pos":[967,1115],"source":"The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is used by forms and controls to force a specific mode for an input method editor (IME)."},{"content":"The IME is an essential component for writing Chinese, Japanese, and Korean scripts, since these writing systems have more characters than can be encoded for a regular keyboard.","pos":[1116,1293]},{"content":"For example, you may want to allow only ASCII characters in a particular text box.","pos":[1294,1376]},{"content":"In such a case you can set the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property to <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box.","pos":[1377,1586],"source":" In such a case you can set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property to <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode> and users will only be able to enter ASCII characters for that particular text box."},{"content":"The default value of the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> property is <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting.","pos":[1587,1798],"source":" The default value of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A> property is <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>, so if you set the property for a form, all controls on the form will inherit that setting."},{"content":"For more information, see <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A&gt;</ph> ) and <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode&gt;</ph>.","pos":[1799,1914],"source":" For more information, see <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ImeMode%2A>\n) and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ImeMode>."},{"pos":[1923,1931],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1935,2037],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Globalizing Windows Forms<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/globalizing-windows-forms.md)</ept>","source":"[Globalizing Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/globalizing-windows-forms.md)"}]}
