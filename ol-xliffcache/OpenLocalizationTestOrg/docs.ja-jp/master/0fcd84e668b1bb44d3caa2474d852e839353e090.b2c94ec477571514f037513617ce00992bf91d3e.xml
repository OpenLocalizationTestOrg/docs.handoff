For more information, see [Differences Between the Windows Forms DataGridView and DataGrid Controls](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/differences-between-the-windows-forms-datagridview-and-datagrid-controls.md).  \n  \n Applying different colors to various parts of a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control can help to make the information in it easier to read and interpret. Color can be applied to rows and columns. Rows and columns can also be hidden or shown at your discretion.  \n  \n There are three basic aspects of formatting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control:  \n  \n-   You can set properties to establish a default style in which data is displayed.  \n  \n-   From that base, you can then customize the way certain tables are displayed at run time.  \n  \n-   Finally, you can modify which columns are displayed in the data grid as well as the colors and other formatting that is shown.  \n  \n As an initial step in formatting a data grid, you can set the properties of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> itself. These color and format choices form a base from which you can then make changes depending on the data tables and columns displayed.  \n  \n The following procedure requires a **Windows Application** project with a form containing a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control. For information about setting up such a project, see [How to: Create a Windows Application Project](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/b2f93fed-c635-4705-8d0e-cf079a264efa) and [How to: Add Controls to Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-add-controls-to-windows-forms.md). In [!INCLUDE[vsprvslong](../../../../includes/vsprvslong-md.md)], the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control is not in the **Toolbox** by default. For more information, see [How to: Add Items to the Toolbox](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/458e119e-17fe-450b-b889-e31c128bd7e0).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  \n  \n### To establish a default style for the DataGrid control  \n  \n1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, set the following properties, as appropriate.  \n  \n    |Property|Description|  \n    |--------------|-----------------|  \n    |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.AlternatingBackColor%2A>|The `BackColor` property defines the color of the even-numbered rows of the grid.

Set this property before resetting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.DataSource%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.DataMember%2A> properties (either separately, or through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method), or the property will have no effect.<br /><br /> The property cannot be set to a value less than 0.|  \n    |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.PreferredRowHeight%2A>|The row height (in pixels) of rows in the grid. Set this property before resetting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.DataSource%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.DataMember%2A> properties (either separately, or through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SetDataBinding%2A> method), or the property will have no effect.<br /><br /> The property cannot be set to a value less than 0.|  \n    |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.RowHeaderWidth%2A>|The width of the row headers of the grid.|  \n    |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SelectionBackColor%2A>|When a row or cell is selected, this is the background color.|  \n    |<xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.SelectionForeColor%2A>|When a row or cell is selected, this is the foreground color.|  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  When you are customizing the colors of controls, it is possible to make the control inaccessible due to poor color choice (for example, red and green). Use the colors available on the **System Colors** palette to avoid this issue.  \n  \n     The following procedure requires a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control bound to a data table. For more information, see [How to: Bind the Windows Forms DataGrid Control to a Data Source](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-bind-the-windows-forms-datagrid-control-to-a-data-source.md).  \n  \n### To set the table and column style of a data table at design time  \n  \n1.  Select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control on your form.  \n  \n2.  In the **Properties** window, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid.TableStyles%2A> property and click the **Ellipsis** (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")) button.  \n  \n3.  In the **DataGridTableStyle Collection Editor** dialog box, click **Add** to add a table style to the collection.  \n  \n     With the **DataGridTableStyle Collection Editor**, you can add and remove table styles, set display and layout properties, and set the mapping name for the table styles.  \n  \n4.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridTableStyle.MappingName%2A> property to the mapping name for each table style.  \n  \n     The mapping name is used to specify which table style should be used with which table.  \n  \n5.  In the **DataGridTableStyle Collection Editor**, select the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridTableStyle.GridColumnStyles%2A> property and click the ellipsis button (![VisualStudioEllipsesButton screenshot](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/media/vbellipsesbutton.png \"vbEllipsesButton\")).  \n  \n6.  In the **DataGridColumnStyle Collection Editor** dialog box, add column styles to the table style you created.  \n  \n     With the **DataGridColumnStyle Collection Editor**, you can add and remove column styles, set display and layout properties, and set the mapping name and formatting strings for the data columns.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  For more information about formatting strings, see [Formatting Types](../../../../docs/standard/base-types/formatting-types.md).  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GridTableStylesCollection>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.GridColumnStylesCollection>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid>   \n [How to: Delete or Hide Columns in the Windows Forms DataGrid Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-delete-or-hide-columns-in-the-windows-forms-datagrid-control.md)   \n [DataGrid Control](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/controls/datagrid-control-windows-forms.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,743],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-winforms\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"jsharp\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"columns [Windows Forms], DataGrid controls\"\n  - \"colors, applying to DataGrid controls\"\n  - \"DataGrid control [Windows Forms], formatting\"\n  - \"DataGrid control [Windows Forms], default styles\"\n  - \"tables [Windows Forms], formatting in DataGrid control\"\n  - \"formatting [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 533b9814-6124-49dc-9fda-085f1502609f\ncaps.latest.revision: 11\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,85],"content":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,85]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[750,818],"content":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer","linkify":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Format the Windows Forms DataGrid Control Using the Designer","pos":[0,68]}]},{"pos":[821,1326],"content":"[!NOTE]\n The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView> control replaces and adds functionality to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control; however, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.DataGrid> control is retained for both backward compatibility and future use, if you choose.
