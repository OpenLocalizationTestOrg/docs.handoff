Its properties, methods, and events allow you to create, copy, move, investigate, and delete files and folders. `My.Computer.FileSystem` provides better performance than the legacy functions (`FileOpen`, `FileClose`, `Input`, `InputString`, `LineInput`, etc.) that are provided by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] for backward compatibility.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Reading from Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/reading-from-files.md)  \n Lists topics dealing with using the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to read from files  \n  \n [Writing to Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/writing-to-files.md)  \n Lists topics dealing with using the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to write to files  \n  \n [Creating, Deleting, and Moving Files and Directories](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/creating-deleting-and-moving-files-and-directories.md)  \n Lists topics dealing with using the `My.Computer.FileSystem` object to creating, copying, deleting and moving files and folders.  \n  \n [Parsing Text Files with the TextFieldParser Object](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/parsing-text-files-with-the-textfieldparser-object.md)  \n Discusses how to use the `TextFieldReader` to parse text files such as logs.  \n  \n [File Encodings](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/file-encodings.md)  \n Describes file encodings and their use.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Manipulating Files and Directories in Visual Basic](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/walkthrough-manipulating-files-and-directories.md)  \n Demonstrates how to create a utility that reports information about files and folders.  \n  \n [Troubleshooting: Reading from and Writing to Text Files](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/troubleshooting-reading-from-and-writing-to-text-files.md)  \n Lists common problems encountered when reading and writing to text files, and suggests remedies for each.","nodes":[{"pos":[12,58],"content":"File Access with Visual Basic | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"File
