on how to access data using ADO.NET, Language Integrated Query (LINQ), WCF Data Services, and XML.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [ADO.NET](../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/index.md)  \n Describes the ADO.NET architecture and how to use the ADO.NET classes to manage application data and interact with data sources, including Microsoft SQL Server, OLE DB data sources, and XML.  \n  \n [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](../../csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)  \n Provides links to relevant documentation for Language Integrated Query (LINQ) using C#.  \n  \n [Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/linq/index.md)  \n Provides links to relevant documentation for Language Integrated Query (LINQ) using Visual Basic.  \n  \n [Transaction Processing](../../../docs/framework/data/transactions/index.md)  \n Discusses the .NET Framework support for transactions.  \n  \n [WCF Data Services 4.5](../../../docs/framework/data/wcf/index.md)  \n Provides information about how to use WCF Data Services to deploy data services on the Web or an intranet.  \n  \n [XML Documents and Data](../../../docs/standard/data/xml/index.md)  \n Provides an overview to a comprehensive and integrated set of classes that work with XML documents and data in the .NET Framework.  \n  \n [XML Standards Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/79c78508-c9d0-423a-a00f-672e855de401)  \n Provides reference information on XML standards that Microsoft supports.  \n  \n## Related Sections
