For example, you might have a function that is only applicable when connected to a particular network domain; in this case you would need a way to determine the domain and disable the function if the domain is not present.  \n  \n Windows Forms applications can use the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class to determine a number of things about a computer at run time. The following example demonstrates using the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class to retrieve the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserDomainName%2A>:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim User As String = Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserName  \nDim Domain As String = Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.UserDomainName  \n  \nMessageBox.Show(\"Good morning \" & User & \". You are connected to \" _  \n& Domain)  \n```  \n  \n```csharp  \nstring User = SystemInformation.UserName;  \nstring Domain = SystemInformation.UserDomainName;  \n  \nMessageBox.Show(\"Good morning \" + User + \". You are connected to \" _  \n+ Domain)  \n```  \n  \n All members of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class are read-only; you cannot modify a user's settings. There are over 100 members of the class, returning information on everything from the number of monitors attached to the computer (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.MonitorCount%2A>) to the spacing of icons in Windows Explorer (<xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.IconHorizontalSpacing%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.IconVerticalSpacing%2A>).  \n  \n Some of the more useful members of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation> class include <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.ComputerName%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.DbcsEnabled%2A>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.PowerStatus%2A>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation.TerminalServerSession%2A>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation>\n- [Power Management in Windows Forms](power-management-in-windows-forms.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,355],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"System Information and Windows Forms\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"domain names [Windows Forms], retrieving\"\n  - \"SystemInformation class [Windows Forms]\"\n  - \"user names [Windows Forms], retrieving\"\n  - \"system information [Windows Forms]\"\nms.assetid: 30cf43a3-8cb2-4ff3-862b-6c34576616a8","nodes":[{"content":"System Information and Windows Forms","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"System Information and Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"System Information and Windows Forms","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[362,398],"content":"System Information and Windows Forms","linkify":"System Information and Windows Forms","nodes":[{"content":"System Information and Windows Forms","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"Sometimes it is necessary to gather information about the computer that your application is running on in order to make decisions in your code.","pos":[399,542]},{"content":"For example, you might have a function that is only applicable when connected to a particular network domain;
