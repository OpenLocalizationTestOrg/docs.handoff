Although these are two different view technologies, they interoperate smoothly.  \n  \n The Windows Forms Designer provides a visual design environment for hosting Windows Presentation Foundation controls. A WPF control is hosted by a special Windows Forms control that is named <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost>. This control enables the WPF control to participate in the form's layout and to receive keyboard and mouse messages. At design time, you can arrange the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Integration.ElementHost> control just as you would any Windows Forms control.  \n  \n You can also use Windows Forms controls in your WPF-based applications. For more information, see [WPF Designer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c6c65214-8411-4e16-b254-163ed4099c26).  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [How to: Copy and Paste an ElementHost Control at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-copy-and-paste-an-elementhost-control-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to copy a Windows Presentation Foundation control on a Windows Form.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Arranging WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-arranging-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to use the Windows Forms layout features, such as anchoring and snaplines, to arrange Windows Presentation Foundation controls.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Changing Properties of a Hosted WPF Element at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-changing-properties-of-a-hosted-wpf-element-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows the workflow between the Windows Forms Designer and the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_long](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-long-md.md)] for changing properties on WPF controls.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Creating New WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-creating-new-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to create a Windows Presentation Foundation control for use in your Windows Forms-based applications.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Copying and Pasting an ElementHost Control into Separate Windows Forms](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/copy--paste-an-elementhost-control-into-forms.md)  \n Shows how to copy a Windows Presentation Foundation control from one Windows Form to another.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Assigning WPF Content on Windows Forms at Design Time](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-assigning-wpf-content-on-windows-forms-at-design-time.md)  \n Shows how to select the Windows Presentation Foundation control types you want to display on your form.  \n  \n [Walkthrough: Styling WPF Content](../../../../docs/framework/winforms/advanced/walkthrough-styling-wpf-content.md)  \n Shows the workflow between the Windows Forms Designer and the [!INCLUDE[wpfdesigner_current_short](../../../../includes/wpfdesigner-current-short-md.md)] for applying styles to Windows Presentation Foundation controls.  \n  \n## Reference  \n
