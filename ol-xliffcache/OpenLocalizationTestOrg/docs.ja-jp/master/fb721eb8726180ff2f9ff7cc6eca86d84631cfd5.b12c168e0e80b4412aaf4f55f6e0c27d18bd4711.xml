In the COM+ hosted mode, the Application.config file is placed in the Application Root Directory (%PROGRAMFILES%\\ComPlus Applications\\\\{appid} is the default). In either of the Web-hosted modes, the Web.config file is placed in the specified vroot directory.  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  Message signing should be used to protect against tampering of messages between a client and a server. Also, message or transport layer encryption should be used to protect against information disclosure from messages between a client and a server. As with [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] services, you should use throttling to limit the number of concurrent calls, connections, instances, and pending operations. This helps prevent over-consumption of resources. Throttling behavior is specified through service configuration file settings.  \n  \n## Example  \n Consider a component that implements the following interface:  \n  \n```  \n[Guid(\"C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7\")]  \npublic interface IFinances  \n{  \n    string Debit(string accountNo, double amount);  \n    string Credit(string accountNo, double amount);  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n If the component is exposed as a Web service, the corresponding service contract that is exposed, and that clients would need to conform to, is as follows:  \n  \n```  \n[ServiceContract(Session = true,  \nNamespace = \"http://tempuri.org/C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7\",  \nName = \"IFinances\")]  \npublic interface IFinancesContract : IDisposable  \n{  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    string Debit(string accountNo, double amount);  \n    [OperationContract]  \n    string Credit(string accountNo, double amount);  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  IID forms part of the initial namespace for the contract.  \n  \n Client applications that use this service would need to conform to this contract, along with using a binding that is compatible with the one specified in the application configuration.  \n  \n The following code example shows a default configuration file. Being a [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] Web service, this conforms to the standard service model configuration schema and can be edited in the same way as other [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] services configuration files.  \n  \n Typical modifications would include:  \n  \n-   Changing the endpoint address from the default ApplicationName/ComponentName/InterfaceName form to a more usable form.  \n  \n-   Modifying the namespace of the service from the default \"http://tempuri.org/InterfaceID\" form to a more relevant form.  \n  \n-   Changing the endpoint to use a different transport binding.  \n  \n     In the COM+-hosted case, the named pipes transport is used by default, but an off-machine transport like TCP can be used instead.  \n  \n```  \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>  \n<configuration>  \n    <system.serviceModel>  \n        <bindings>  \n            <netNamedPipeBinding>  \n                <binding name=\"comNonTransactionalBinding\" />  \n                <binding name=\"comTransactionalBinding\" transactionFlow=\"true\" />  \n            </netNamedPipeBinding>  \n        </bindings>  \n        <comContracts>  \n            <comContract contract=\"{C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7}\"  \n                name=\"IFinances\" namespace=\"http://tempuri.org/C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7\"  \n                requiresSession=\"true\">  \n                <exposedMethods>  \n                    <add exposedMethod=\"Debit\" />  \n                    <add exposedMethod=\"Credit\" />  \n                </exposedMethods>  \n            </comContract>  \n        </comContracts>  \n        <services>  \n            <service name=\"{DCDB24CC-0B19-4534-95CD-FBBFF4D67DD9},{C942B840-AD54-4A44-B5F7-928130980AB9}\">  \n                <endpoint address=\"IFinances\" binding=\"netNamedPipeBinding\" bindingConfiguration=\"comNonTransactionalBinding\"  \n                    contract=\"{C551FBA9-E3AA-4272-8C2A-84BD8D290AC7}\" />  \n                <host>  \n                    <baseAddresses>  \n                        <add baseAddress=\"net.pipe://localhost/ServiceModelDocSampleApp/ServiceModelDocSample.esFinance\" />  \n                    </baseAddresses>  \n                </host>  \n            </service>  \n        </services>  \n    </system.serviceModel>  \n</configuration>  \n  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Integrating with COM+ Applications](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/integrating-with-com-plus-applications.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,68],"content":"How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,56]}]},{"pos":[436,475],"content":"How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings","linkify":"How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Configure COM+ Service Settings","pos":[0,39]}]},{"content":"When an application interface is added or removed by using the COM+ Service Configuration tool, the Web service configuration is updated within the application's configuration file.","pos":[476,657]},{"content":"In the COM+ hosted mode, the Application.config file is placed in the Application Root Directory (%PROGRAMFILES%\\ComPlus Applications<ph id=\"ph1\">\\\\</ph>{appid} is the default).","pos":[658,817],"source":" In the COM+ hosted mode, the Application.config file is placed in the Application Root Directory (%PROGRAMFILES%\\ComPlus Applications\\\\{appid} is the default)."},{"content":"In either of the Web-hosted modes, the Web.config file is placed in the specified vroot directory.","pos":[818,916]},{"pos":[924,1500],"content":"[!NOTE]\n Message signing should be used to protect against tampering of messages between a client and a server.
