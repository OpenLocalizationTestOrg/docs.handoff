Unmanaged types include the built-in types that are listed in the table that follows, and also the following:  \n  \n-   Enum types  \n  \n-   Pointer types  \n  \n-   User-defined structs that do not contain any fields or properties that are reference types  \n  \n The following example shows how to retrieve the size of an `int`:  \n  \n```csharp  \n// Constant value 4:  \nint intSize = sizeof(int);   \n```  \n  \n## Remarks  \n Starting with version 2.0 of C#, applying `sizeof` to built-in types no longer requires that [unsafe](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/unsafe.md) mode be used.  \n  \n The `sizeof` operator cannot be overloaded. The values returned by the `sizeof` operator are of type `int`. The following table shows the constant values that are substituted for `sizeof` expressions that have certain built-in types as operands.  \n  \n|Expression|Constant value|  \n|----------------|--------------------|  \n|`sizeof(sbyte)`|1|  \n|`sizeof(byte)`|1|  \n|`sizeof(short)`|2|  \n|`sizeof(ushort)`|2|  \n|`sizeof(int)`|4|  \n|`sizeof(uint)`|4|  \n|`sizeof(long)`|8|  \n|`sizeof(ulong)`|8|  \n|`sizeof(char)`|2 (Unicode)|  \n|`sizeof(float)`|4|  \n|`sizeof(double)`|8|  \n|`sizeof(decimal)`|16|  \n|`sizeof(bool)`|1|  \n  \n For all other types, including structs, the `sizeof` operator can be used only in unsafe code blocks. Although you can use the <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method, the value returned by this method is not always the same as the value returned by `sizeof`. <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.SizeOf%2A?displayProperty=fullName> returns the size after the type has been marshaled, whereas `sizeof` returns the size as it has been allocated by the common language runtime, including any padding.  \n  \n## Example  \n [!code-cs[csrefKeywordsOperator#11](../../../csharp/language-reference/keywords/codesnippet/CSharp/sizeof_1.cs)]
