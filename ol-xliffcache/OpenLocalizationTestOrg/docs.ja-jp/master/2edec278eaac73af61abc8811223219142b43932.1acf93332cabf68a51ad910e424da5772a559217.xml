For this reason, every attribute must use values that are constant at compile time, and therefore every attribute argument must evaluate to a compile-time constant value.  \n  \n Certain type conversions cannot produce values that are constant at compile time. For example, converting a `String` to a `Double` or a `Date` depends on the locale setting at run time. Other conversions, such as an array of a derived type to an array of `Object`, present a variety of problems that do not permit the compiler to allow them on attribute arguments.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC30934  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Use an expression that evaluates to the same data type as the corresponding parameter, as defined by the attribute.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Attributes overview](~/docs/visual-basic/programming-guide/concepts/attributes/index.md)\n\n- [Const Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/const-statement.md)\n- [Type Conversions in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/data-types/type-conversions.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,273],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Conversion from '<type1>' to '<type2>' cannot occur in a constant expression used as an argument to an attribute\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
