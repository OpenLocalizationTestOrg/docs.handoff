For example:  \n  \n```  \n@file1.rsp @file2.rsp  \n```  \n  \n In a response file, multiple compiler options and source code files can appear on one line. A single compiler option specification must appear on one line (cannot span multiple lines). Response files can have comments that begin with the # symbol.  \n  \n Specifying compiler options from within a response file is just like issuing those commands on the command line. See [Building from the Command Line](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md) for more information.  \n  \n The compiler processes the command options as they are encountered. Therefore, command line arguments can override previously listed options in response files. Conversely, options in a response file will override options listed previously on the command line or in other response files.  \n  \n C# provides the csc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the csc.exe file. See [/noconfig](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md) for more information on csc.rsp.  \n  \n This compiler option cannot be set in the Visual Studio development environment, nor can it be changed programmatically.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following are a few lines from a sample response file:  \n  \n```  \n# build the first output file  \n/target:exe /out:MyExe.exe source1.cs source2.cs  \n```  \n  \n## See Also  \n [C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[12,52],"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","needQuote":false,"needEscape":true,"nodes":[{"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,40]}]},{"pos":[596,619],"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","linkify":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","nodes":[{"content":"@ (C# Compiler Options)","pos":[0,23]}]},{"content":"The @ option lets you specify a file that contains compiler options and source code files to compile.","pos":[620,721]},{"pos":[730,736],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[777,786],"content":"Arguments","linkify":"Arguments","nodes":[{"content":"Arguments","pos":[0,9]}]},{"content":"A file that lists compiler options or source code files to compile.","pos":[809,876]},{"pos":[885,892],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The compiler options and source code files will be processed by the compiler just as if they had been specified on the command line.","pos":[896,1028]},{"content":"To specify more than one response file in a compilation, specify multiple response file options.","pos":[1035,1131]},{"content":"For example:","pos":[1132,1144]},{"content":"In a response file, multiple compiler options and source code files can appear on one line.","pos":[1190,1281]},{"content":"A single compiler option specification must appear on one line (cannot span multiple lines).","pos":[1282,1374]},{"content":"Response files can have comments that begin with the # symbol.","pos":[1375,1437]},{"content":"Specifying compiler options from within a response file is just like issuing those commands on the command line.","pos":[1444,1556]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Building from the Command Line<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md)</ept> for more information.","pos":[1557,1739],"source":" See [Building from the Command Line](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/how-to-set-environment-variables-for-the-visual-studio-command-line.md) for more information."},{"content":"The compiler processes the command options as they are encountered.","pos":[1746,1813]},{"content":"Therefore, command line arguments can override previously listed options in response files.","pos":[1814,1905]},{"content":"Conversely, options in a response file will override options listed previously on the command line or in other response files.","pos":[1906,2032]},{"content":"C# provides the csc.rsp file, which is located in the same directory as the csc.exe file.","pos":[2039,2128]},{"content":"See <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>/noconfig<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md)</ept> for more information on csc.rsp.","pos":[2129,2258],"source":" See [/noconfig](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/noconfig-compiler-option.md) for more information on csc.rsp."},{"content":"This compiler option cannot be set in the Visual Studio development environment, nor can it be changed programmatically.","pos":[2265,2385]},{"pos":[2394,2401],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following are a few lines from a sample response file:","pos":[2405,2463]},{"pos":[2570,2578],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2582,2665],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>C# Compiler Options<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)</ept>","source":"[C# Compiler Options](../../../csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/index.md)"}]}
