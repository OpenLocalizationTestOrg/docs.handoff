Consequently, the transaction was aborted.  \n  \n## Description  \n Traced if a Replay message is received while a Durable participant is still Preparing. This is an illegal message for this state and the transaction is going to be aborted.  \n  \n## Troubleshooting  \n Receiving this error can indiate that a Durable participant (including Subordinate TransactionManagers) has recovered from failure, however it is unsure of the transaction outcome and request its status.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)\n- [Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)\n- [Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,163],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.assetid: 10ef3876-6f8e-4d4e-8444-f47847b64795","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","nodes":[{"pos":[0,79],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","pos":[0,79]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[170,249],"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","linkify":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","nodes":[{"content":"Microsoft.Transactions.TransactionBridge.DurableParticipantReplayWhilePreparing","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"The WS-AT protocol service received a Replay message from a durable participant, which did not respond to Prepare.","pos":[250,364]},{"content":"Consequently, the transaction was aborted.","pos":[365,407]},{"pos":[416,427],"content":"Description","linkify":"Description","nodes":[{"content":"Description","pos":[0,11]}]},{"content":"Traced if a Replay message is received while a Durable participant is still Preparing.","pos":[431,517]},{"content":"This is an illegal message for this state and the transaction is going to be aborted.","pos":[518,603]},{"pos":[612,627],"content":"Troubleshooting","linkify":"Troubleshooting","nodes":[{"content":"Troubleshooting","pos":[0,15]}]},{"content":"Receiving this error can indiate that a Durable participant (including Subordinate TransactionManagers) has recovered from failure, however it is unsure of the transaction outcome and request its status.","pos":[631,834]},{"pos":[843,851],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[855,928],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Tracing<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Tracing](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/index.md)"},{"pos":[931,1084],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)</ept>","source":"[Using Tracing to Troubleshoot Your Application](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/tracing/using-tracing-to-troubleshoot-your-application.md)"},{"pos":[1087,1175],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Administration and Diagnostics<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)</ept>","source":"[Administration and Diagnostics](../../../../../docs/framework/wcf/diagnostics/index.md)"}]}
