Only the `And` operator is allowed to combine multiple `Equals` operators in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC36620  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  Restructure the `Equals` clauses to make comparisons by using only the `And` operator. The following is an example:  \n  \n```vb  \nDim petOwnersJoin = From pers In people _  \n                    Join pet In pets _  \n                    On pet.Owner Equals pers And _  \n                       pet.Name = pers.PetName_  \n                    Select pers, pet  \n```  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Combine Data with Joins](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-combine-data-with-linq-by-using-joins.md)\n- [Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/join-clause.md)\n- [Group Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-join-clause.md)\n- [Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)\n- [LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,175],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'And' expected\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc36620\"\n  - \"bc36620\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC36620\"\nms.assetid: b3d21d4d-86c0-44d2-8afc-c19d375e9ddd","nodes":[{"content":"'And' expected","nodes":[{"pos":[0,14],"content":"'And' expected","nodes":[{"content":"'And' expected","pos":[0,14]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[182,196],"content":"'And' expected","linkify":"'And' expected","nodes":[{"content":"'And' expected","pos":[0,14]}]},{"content":"A comparison operator other than <ph id=\"ph1\">`And`</ph> has been used to combine two or more <ph id=\"ph2\">`Equals`</ph> operators in a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Join`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">`Group Join`</ph> clause.","pos":[197,327],"source":"A comparison operator other than `And` has been used to combine two or more `Equals` operators in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause."},{"content":"Only the <ph id=\"ph1\">`And`</ph> operator is allowed to combine multiple <ph id=\"ph2\">`Equals`</ph> operators in a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Join`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">`Group Join`</ph> clause.","pos":[328,437],"source":" Only the `And` operator is allowed to combine multiple `Equals` operators in a `Join` or `Group Join` clause."},{"pos":[444,465],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC36620","source":"**Error ID:** BC36620"},{"pos":[474,495],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Restructure the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Equals`</ph> clauses to make comparisons by using only the <ph id=\"ph2\">`And`</ph> operator.","pos":[505,591],"source":"Restructure the `Equals` clauses to make comparisons by using only the `And` operator."},{"content":"The following is an example:","pos":[592,620]},{"pos":[873,881],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[885,1027],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Combine Data with Joins<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-combine-data-with-linq-by-using-joins.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Combine Data with Joins](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/how-to-combine-data-with-linq-by-using-joins.md)"},{"pos":[1030,1105],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Join Clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/join-clause.md)</ept>","source":"[Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/join-clause.md)"},{"pos":[1108,1195],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Group Join Clause<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-join-clause.md)</ept>","source":"[Group Join Clause](../../visual-basic/language-reference/queries/group-join-clause.md)"},{"pos":[1198,1321],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)</ept>","source":"[Introduction to LINQ in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/introduction-to-linq.md)"},{"pos":[1324,1400],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>LINQ<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)</ept>","source":"[LINQ](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/linq/index.md)"}]}
