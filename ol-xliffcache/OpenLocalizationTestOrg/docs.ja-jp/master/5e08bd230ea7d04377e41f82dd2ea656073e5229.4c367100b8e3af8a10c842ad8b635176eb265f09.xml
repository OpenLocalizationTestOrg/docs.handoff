This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable ([!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]) host applications.  \n  \n The following example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets#IsBrowserHostedCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets/CSharp/Page1.xaml.cs#isbrowserhostedcode)]\n [!code-vb[HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets#IsBrowserHostedCODE](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Wpf/HOWTOBrowserInteropHelperSnippets/visualbasic/page1.xaml.vb#isbrowserhostedcode)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>   \n <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page>","nodes":[{"pos":[4,457],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-wpf\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"hosted pages in browser\"\n  - \"pages, hosted in browser\"\nms.assetid: 737e0f26-8371-49b4-9579-70879e51e1aa\ncaps.latest.revision: 7\nauthor: dotnet-bot\nms.author: dotnetcontent\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,62],"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,62]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[464,509],"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","linkify":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Determine If a Page is Browser Hosted","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"This example demonstrates how to determine if a <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is hosted in a browser.","pos":[510,617],"source":"This example demonstrates how to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser."},{"pos":[626,633],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> can be host agnostic and, consequently, can be loaded into several different types of hosts, including a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame&gt;</ph>, a <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow&gt;</ph>, or a browser.","pos":[637,884],"source":"A <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> can be host agnostic and, consequently, can be loaded into several different types of hosts, including a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Frame>, a <xref:System.Windows.Navigation.NavigationWindow>, or a browser."},{"content":"This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable (<ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]</ph>) host applications.","pos":[885,1118],"source":" This can happen when you have a library assembly that contains one or more pages, and which is referenced by multiple standalone and browsable ([!INCLUDE[TLA#tla_xbap](../../../../includes/tlasharptla-xbap-md.md)]) host applications."},{"content":"The following example demonstrates how to use <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=fullName&gt;</ph> to determine if a <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page&gt;</ph> is hosted in a browser.","pos":[1125,1343],"source":"The following example demonstrates how to use <xref:System.Windows.Interop.BrowserInteropHelper.IsBrowserHosted%2A?displayProperty=fullName> to determine if a <xref:System.Windows.Controls.Page> is hosted in a browser."},{"pos":[1761,1769],"content":"See Also","linkify":"See Also","nodes":[{"content":"See Also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
