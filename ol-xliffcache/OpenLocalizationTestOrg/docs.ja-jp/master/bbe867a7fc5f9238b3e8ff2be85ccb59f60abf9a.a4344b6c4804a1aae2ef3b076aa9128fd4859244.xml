This topic provides [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] users with the steps to implement the validation process.  \n  \n [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../../../../../../includes/note-settings-general-md.md)]  \n  \n### To validate a .dbml or XML file  \n  \n1.  On the Visual Studio **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **File**.  \n  \n2.  In the **Open File** dialog box, click the .dbml or XML mapping file that you want to validate.  \n  \n     The file opens in the **XML Editor**.  \n  \n3.  Right-click the window, and then click **Properties**.  \n  \n4.  In the **Properties** window, click the ellipsis for the **Schemas** property.  \n  \n     The **XML Schemas** dialog box opens.  \n  \n5.  Note the appropriate schema definition for your purpose.  \n  \n    -   DbmlSchema.xsd is the schema definition for validating a .dbml file. For more information, see [Code Generation in LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/code-generation-in-linq-to-sql.md).  \n  \n    -   LinqToSqlMapping.xsd is the schema definition for validating an external XML mapping file. For more information, see [External Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/external-mapping.md).  \n  \n6.  In the **Use** column of the desired schema definition row, click to open the drop-down box, and then click **Use this schema**.  \n  \n     The schema definition file is now associated with your DBML or XML mapping file.  \n  \n     Make sure no other schema definitions are selected.  \n  \n7.  On the **View** menu, click **Error List**.  \n  \n     Determine whether errors, warnings, or messages have been generated. If not, the XML file is valid against the schema definition.  \n  \n## Alternate Method for Supplying Schema Definition  \n If for some reason the appropriate .xsd file does not appear in the **XML Schemas** dialog box, you can download the .xsd file from a Help topic. The following steps help you save the downloaded file in the Unicode format required by the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../../../../../../includes/vs-current-short-md.md)] XML Editor.  \n  \n#### To copy a schema definition file from a Help topic  \n  \n1.  Locate the Help topic that contains the schema definition as described earlier in this topic.  \n  \n    -   For .dbml files, see [Code Generation in LINQ to SQL](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/code-generation-in-linq-to-sql.md).  \n  \n    -   For external mapping files, see [External Mapping](../../../../../../docs/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/external-mapping.md).  \n  \n2.  Click **Copy Code** to copy the code file to the Clipboard.  \n  \n3.  Start Notepad to create a new file.  \n  \n4.  Paste the code from the clipboard into Notepad file.  \n  \n5.  On the Notepad **File** menu, click **Save As**.  \n  \n6.  In the **Encoding** box, select **Unicode**.  \n  \n    > [!IMPORTANT]\n    >  This selection guarantees that the Unicode-16 byte-order marker (`FFFE`) is prepended to the text file.  \n  \n7.  In the **File name** box, create a file name with an .xsd extension.  \n  \n## See Also  \n
