This example creates the directory `NewDirectory` in `C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Documents`.  \n  \n     [!code-vb[VbVbcnMyFileSystem#2](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbcnMyFileSystem/VB/Class1.vb#2)]  \n  \n## Robust Programming  \n The following conditions may cause an exception:  \n  \n-   The directory name is malformed. For example, it contains illegal characters or is only white space (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  \n  \n-   The parent directory of the directory to be created is read-only (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  \n  \n-   The directory name is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  \n  \n-   The directory name is too long (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  \n  \n-   The directory name is a colon \":\" (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  \n  \n-   The user does not have permission to create the directory (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  \n  \n-   The user lacks permissions in a partial-trust situation (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.CreateDirectory%2A>\n- [Creating, Deleting, and Moving Files and Directories](../../../../visual-basic/developing-apps/programming/drives-directories-files/creating-deleting-and-moving-files-and-directories.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,228],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Directory in Visual Basic\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
