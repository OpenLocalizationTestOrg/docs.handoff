If this value is `mdTokenNil`, the lookup is done for a global variable or a global-function reference.  \n  \n `szName`  \n [in] The name of the member reference to search for.  \n  \n `pvSigBlob`  \n [in] A pointer to the binary metadata signature of the member reference.  \n  \n `cbSigBlob`  \n [in] The size in bytes of `pvSigBlob`.  \n  \n `pmr`  \n [out] A pointer to the matching MemberRef token.  \n  \n## Remarks  \n You specify the member using its enclosing class or interface (`td`), its name (`szName`), and optionally its signature (`pvSigBlob`).  \n  \n The signature passed to `FindMemberRef` must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope. A signature can embed a token that identifies the enclosing class or value type. The token is an index into the local TypeDef table. You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to `FindMemberRef`.  \n  \n `FindMemberRef` finds only member references that were defined directly in the class or interface; it does not find inherited member references.  \n  \n## Requirements  \n **Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../../../docs/framework/get-started/system-requirements.md).  \n  \n **Header:** Cor.h  \n  \n **Library:** Included as a resource in MsCorEE.dll  \n  \n **.NET Framework Versions:** [!INCLUDE[net_current_v10plus](../../../../includes/net-current-v10plus-md.md)]  \n  \n## See Also  \n [IMetaDataImport Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/imetadataimport-interface.md)   \n [IMetaDataImport2 Interface](../../../../docs/framework/unmanaged-api/metadata/imetadataimport2-interface.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,707],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"reference\"\napi_name: \n  - \"IMetaDataImport.FindMemberRef\"\napi_location: \n  - \"mscoree.dll\"\napi_type: \n  - \"COM\"\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"C++\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef method [.NET Framework metadata]\"\n  - \"FindMemberRef method [.NET Framework metadata]\"\nms.assetid: 1ccda329-d752-4d89-abe8-511af3c3f4c9\ntopic_type: \n  - \"apiref\"\ncaps.latest.revision: 12\nauthor: \"mairaw\"\nms.author: \"mairaw\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,54],"content":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,54]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[714,751],"content":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method","linkify":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method","nodes":[{"content":"IMetaDataImport::FindMemberRef Method","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"Gets a pointer to the MemberRef token for the member reference that is enclosed by the specified <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Type&gt;</ph> and that has the specified name and metadata signature.","pos":[752,923],"source":"Gets a pointer to the MemberRef token for the member reference that is enclosed by the specified <xref:System.Type> and that has the specified name and metadata signature."},{"pos":[932,938],"content":"Syntax","linkify":"Syntax","nodes":[{"content":"Syntax","pos":[0,6]}]},{"pos":[1187,1197],"content":"Parameters","linkify":"Parameters","nodes":[{"content":"Parameters","pos":[0,10]}]},{"content":"[in] The TypeRef token for the class or interface that encloses the member reference to search for.","pos":[1209,1308]},{"content":"If this value is <ph id=\"ph1\">`mdTokenNil`</ph>, the lookup is done for a global variable or a global-function reference.","pos":[1309,1412],"source":" If this value is `mdTokenNil`, the lookup is done for a global variable or a global-function reference."},{"content":"[in] The name of the member reference to search for.","pos":[1431,1483]},{"content":"[in] A pointer to the binary metadata signature of the member reference.","pos":[1505,1577]},{"content":"[in] The size in bytes of <ph id=\"ph1\">`pvSigBlob`</ph>.","pos":[1599,1637],"source":"[in] The size in bytes of `pvSigBlob`."},{"content":"[out] A pointer to the matching MemberRef token.","pos":[1653,1701]},{"pos":[1710,1717],"content":"Remarks","linkify":"Remarks","nodes":[{"content":"Remarks","pos":[0,7]}]},{"pos":[1721,1855],"content":"You specify the member using its enclosing class or interface (<ph id=\"ph1\">`td`</ph>), its name (<ph id=\"ph2\">`szName`</ph>), and optionally its signature (<ph id=\"ph3\">`pvSigBlob`</ph>).","source":"You specify the member using its enclosing class or interface (`td`), its name (`szName`), and optionally its signature (`pvSigBlob`)."},{"content":"The signature passed to <ph id=\"ph1\">`FindMemberRef`</ph> must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope.","pos":[1862,2000],"source":"The signature passed to `FindMemberRef` must have been generated in the current scope, because signatures are bound to a particular scope."},{"content":"A signature can embed a token that identifies the enclosing class or value type.","pos":[2001,2081]},{"content":"The token is an index into the local TypeDef table.","pos":[2082,2133]},{"content":"You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to <ph id=\"ph1\">`FindMemberRef`</ph>.","pos":[2134,2264],"source":" You cannot build a run-time signature outside the context of the current scope and use that signature as input to `FindMemberRef`."},{"pos":[2271,2415],"content":"<ph id=\"ph1\">`FindMemberRef`</ph> finds only member references that were defined directly in the class or interface;
