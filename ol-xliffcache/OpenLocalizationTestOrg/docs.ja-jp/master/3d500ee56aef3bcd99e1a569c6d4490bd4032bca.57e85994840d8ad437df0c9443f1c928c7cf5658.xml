All the examples in this topic illustrate the cache policy for a resource that is cached on January 1 and expires on January 4.  \n  \n The following examples illustrate the cache policy that results from the interaction of the maximum age (`maxAge`) and minimum freshness (`minFresh`) values.  \n  \n-   If the cache policy sets `maxAge` = 2 days and `minFresh` is not specified, the content is revalidated on January 3.  \n  \n-   If the cache policy sets `maxAge` = 2 days and `minFresh` = 1 day, according to `maxAge`, the content is fresh until January 3. According to `minFresh`, the content is fresh until January 3. Therefore, the content must be revalidated on January 3.  \n  \n-   If the cache policy sets `maxAge` = 2 days and `minFresh` = 2 days, according to `maxAge`, the content is fresh until January 3. According to `minFresh` the content is fresh until January 2. Therefore, the content must be revalidated on January 2.  \n  \n## See Also  \n [Cache Management for Network
