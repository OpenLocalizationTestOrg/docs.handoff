(Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string HelpLink { get; set; }`|Gets or sets a link to the help file associated with this exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public int HResult { get; protected set; }`|Gets or sets the `HRESULT`, a coded numeric value that is assigned to a specific exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public Exception InnerException { get; }`|Gets the exception that caused the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string Message { get; }`|Gets a message that describes the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.TypeLoadException>.)|  \n|`public string Source { get; set; }`|Gets or sets the name of the application or object that caused the error. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public string StackTrace { get; }`|Gets a string representation of the immediate frames on the call stack. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public MethodBase TargetSite { get; }`|Gets the method that threw the current exception.

(Inherited from <xref:System.TypeLoadException>.)|  \n  \n## Methods  \n  \n|Method|Description|  \n|------------|-----------------|  \n|`public bool Equals(Object obj)`|Determines whether the specified object is equal to the current object.  (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`protected void Finalize()`|Allows an object to try to free resources and perform other cleanup operations before it is reclaimed by garbage collection. (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  \n|`public Exception GetBaseException()`|Returns the exception that is the root cause of one or more subsequent exceptions. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n|`public int GetHashCode()`|Returns a hash code for a `MissingMetadataException` instance.   (Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  \n|`public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)`|Sets a <xref:System.Runtime.Serialization.SerializationInfo> object with information about the exception.

(Inherited from <xref:System.Object>.)|  \n|`public string ToString()`|Returns the string representation of the current exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n  \n## Events  \n  \n|Event|Description|  \n|-----------|-----------------|  \n|`protected event EventHandler<SafeSerializationEventArgs> SerializeObjectState`|Occurs when an exception is serialized to create an exception state object that contains serialized data about the exception. (Inherited from <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>.)|  \n  \n## Usage Details  \n The `MissingMetadataException` exception is thrown when reflection is used to access metadata that isn’t available in an assembly.  \n  \n The metadata that is available to an app at run time is defined by the runtime directives (XML configuration) file, *.rd.xml. To prevent your app from throwing this exception, you must modify \\*.rd.xml to define the metadata that must be present at run time. For information about the format of the \\*.rd.xml file, see [Runtime Directives (rd.xml) Configuration File Reference](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  Because this exception indicates that metadata needed by your application isn’t available at run time, you shouldn’t handle this exception in a `try`/`catch` block. Instead, you should diagnose the cause of the exception and eliminate it by using a runtime directives file. To get the entry that you can add to your runtime directives file that eliminates the exception, you can use one of two troubleshooters:  \n>   \n>  -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/type.html) for types.  \n> -   The [MissingMetadataException troubleshooter](http://dotnet.github.io/native/troubleshooter/method.html) for methods.  \n  \n The `MissingMetadataException` class contains no unique members; all of its members are inherited from its base class, <xref:System.TypeAccessException>.  \n  \n## See Also  \n <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=fullName>   \n <xref:System.TypeAccessException>   \n [MissingInteropDataException Class](../../../docs/framework/net-native/missinginteropdataexception-class-net-native.md)   \n [MissingRuntimeArtifactException Class](../../../docs/framework/net-native/missingruntimeartifactexception-class-net-native.md)   \n [Runtime Directives (rd.xml) Configuration File Reference](../../../docs/framework/net-native/runtime-directives-rd-xml-configuration-file-reference.md)","nodes":[{"pos":[4,370],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs\"\nms.custom: \"\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nms.prod: \".net-framework\"\nms.reviewer: \"\"\nms.suite: \"\"\nms.technology: \n  - \"dotnet-clr\"\nms.tgt_pltfrm: \"\"\nms.topic: \"article\"\nms.assetid: 408f25c4-6d60-475c-92b1-7b52b777c6db\ncaps.latest.revision: 18\nauthor: \"rpetrusha\"\nms.author: \"ronpet\"\nmanager: \"wpickett\"","nodes":[{"content":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","nodes":[{"content":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native) | Microsoft Docs","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"]}],"yml":true},{"pos":[377,421],"content":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native)","linkify":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native)","nodes":[{"content":"MissingMetadataException Class (.NET Native)","pos":[0,44]}]},{"pos":[422,527],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>.NET for Windows apps for Windows 10, <ph id=\"ph1\">[!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)]</ph> only<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**.NET for Windows apps for Windows 10, [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] only**"},{"content":"The exception that is thrown when reflection is used to retrieve metadata that isn't present.","pos":[534,627]},{"pos":[634,666],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Namespace:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> System.Reflection","source":"**Namespace:** System.Reflection"},{"pos":[674,1181],"content":"[!IMPORTANT]\n The `MissingMetadataException` class is intended solely for internal use by the [!INCLUDE[net_native](../../../includes/net-native-md.md)] tool chain.
