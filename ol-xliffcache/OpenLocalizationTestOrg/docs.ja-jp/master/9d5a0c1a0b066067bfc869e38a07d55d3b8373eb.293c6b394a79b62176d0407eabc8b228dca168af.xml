This allows code to create an object directly from the interface using a `New` clause.  \n  \n If the code using the `New` clause does not have access to the underlying class, for example if the class is `Private`, then the compiler generates this error.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31109  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n1.  If you have source control over the underlying class, then adjust its access level so the using code can access it.  \n  \n2.  If for any reason you cannot change the access level of the underlying class, then remove the `New` clause. You cannot create an object directly from this interface.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Runtime.InteropServices.CoClassAttribute>\n- [New Operator](../../visual-basic/language-reference/operators/new-operator.md)\n- [Access levels in Visual Basic](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/declared-elements/access-levels.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,299],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Implementing class '<underlyingclassname>' for interface '<interfacename>' is not accessible in this context because it is '<accesslevel>'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  -
