Assume that the variable `point` holds the location of the most recent click. The code checks to see whether `point` is in the plus-shaped region. If the point is in the region (a hit), the region is filled with an opaque red brush. Otherwise, the region is filled with a semitransparent red brush.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](~/samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/CS/Class1.cs#31)]\n [!code-vb[System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics#31](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Drawing.MiscLegacyTopics/VB/Class1.vb#31)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.Drawing.Region>\n- [Regions in GDI+](regions-in-gdi.md)\n- [How to: Use Clipping with a Region](how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,267],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"hit tests [Windows Forms], using regions\"\n  - \"regions [Windows Forms], hit testing\"\nms.assetid: 3a4c07cb-a40a-4d14-ad35-008f531910a8","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[274,311],"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","linkify":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Use Hit Testing with a Region","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"The purpose of hit testing is to determine whether the cursor is over a given object, such as an icon or a button.","pos":[312,426]},{"pos":[435,442],"content":"Example","linkify":"Example","nodes":[{"content":"Example","pos":[0,7]}]},{"content":"The following example creates a plus-shaped region by forming the union of two rectangular regions.","pos":[446,545]},{"content":"Assume that the variable <ph id=\"ph1\">`point`</ph> holds the location of the most recent click.","pos":[546,623],"source":" Assume that the variable `point` holds the location of the most recent click."},{"content":"The code checks to see whether <ph id=\"ph1\">`point`</ph> is in the plus-shaped region.","pos":[624,692],"source":" The code checks to see whether `point` is in the plus-shaped region."},{"content":"If the point is in the region (a hit), the region is filled with an opaque red brush.","pos":[693,778]},{"content":"Otherwise, the region is filled with a semitransparent red brush.","pos":[779,844]},{"pos":[1155,1173],"content":"Compiling the Code","linkify":"Compiling the Code","nodes":[{"content":"Compiling the Code","pos":[0,18]}]},{"pos":[1177,1373],"content":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs&gt;</ph> <ph id=\"ph2\">`e`</ph>, which is a parameter of <ph id=\"ph3\">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler&gt;</ph>.","source":"The preceding example is designed for use with Windows Forms, and it requires <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs> `e`, which is a parameter of <xref:System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventHandler>."},{"pos":[1382,1390],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1425,1461],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Regions in GDI+<ept id=\"p1\">](regions-in-gdi.md)</ept>","source":"[Regions in GDI+](regions-in-gdi.md)"},{"pos":[1464,1538],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Use Clipping with a Region<ept id=\"p1\">](how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Use Clipping with a Region](how-to-use-clipping-with-a-region.md)"}]}
