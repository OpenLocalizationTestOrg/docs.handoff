For more information, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md). An alternative, outlined here, is to create a class and then apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute to the class directly and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute to each of the methods in the class that are part of the contract.  \n  \n> [!WARNING]\n>  `[ServiceContract]` and `[ServiceContractAttribute]` do the same thing. The same thing is true for `[OperationContract]` and `[OperationContractAttribute]`. In each case, the former is shorthand for the latter.  \n  \n For more information about service contracts, see [Designing Service Contracts](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/designing-service-contracts.md).  \n  \n### Creating a Windows Communication Foundation contract with a class  \n  \n1.  Create a new class using Visual Basic, C#, or any other common language runtime language.  \n  \n2.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> class to the class.  \n  \n3.  Create methods in the class.  \n  \n4.  Apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class to each method that must be exposed as part of the public WCF contract.  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example shows a class that defines a service contract.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithClass#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithclass/cs/source.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[c_HowTo_CreateContractWithClass#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_CFX/c_howto_createcontractwithclass/vb/source.vb#1)]  \n  \n The methods that have the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> class applied use a request-reply message pattern by default. For more information about this message pattern, see [How to: Create a Request-Reply Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-request-reply-contract.md). You can also create and use other message patterns by setting properties of the attribute. For more examples, see [How to: Create a One-Way Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-one-way-contract.md) and [How to: Create a Duplex Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-create-a-duplex-contract.md).  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute>\n- <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,189],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\ndev_langs: \n  - \"csharp\"\n  - \"vb\"\nms.assetid: 1ad69393-3915-4e7f-9b91-b6fc59c6f5ba","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","nodes":[{"pos":[0,71],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","pos":[0,71]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[196,267],"content":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","linkify":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","nodes":[{"content":"How to: Create a Windows Communication Foundation Contract with a Class","pos":[0,71]}]},{"content":"The preferred way of creating a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) contract is by using an interface.","pos":[268,373]},{"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Define a Service Contract<ept id=\"p1\">](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md)</ept>.","pos":[374,508],"source":" For more information, see [How to: Define a Service Contract](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/how-to-define-a-wcf-service-contract.md)."},{"content":"An alternative, outlined here, is to create a class and then apply the <ph id=\"ph1\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute to the class directly and the <ph id=\"ph2\">&lt;xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute&gt;</ph> attribute to each of the methods in the class that are part of the contract.","pos":[509,802],"source":" An alternative, outlined here, is to create a class and then apply the <xref:System.ServiceModel.ServiceContractAttribute> attribute to the class directly and the <xref:System.ServiceModel.OperationContractAttribute> attribute to each of the methods in the class that are part of the contract."},{"pos":[810,1034],"content":"[!WARNING]\n `[ServiceContract]` and `[ServiceContractAttribute]` do the same thing.
