In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level. You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC31105  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   Remove the access modifier from the `Get` statement. It represents the entire `ReadOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)\n- [How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,222],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc31105\"\n  - \"bc31105\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC31105\"\nms.assetid: 54066d8e-eb22-4b99-bb18-45afe61d3b33","nodes":[{"content":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","nodes":[{"pos":[0,61],"content":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","nodes":[{"content":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","pos":[0,61]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[229,290],"content":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","linkify":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","nodes":[{"content":"'ReadOnly' properties cannot have an access modifier on 'Get'","pos":[0,61]}]},{"pos":[291,545],"content":"A <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReadOnly`</ph> property declaration specifies access levels in both the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Statement<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md)</ept> and the <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Get Statement<ept id=\"p2\">](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/get-statement.md)</ept>.","source":"A `ReadOnly` property declaration specifies access levels in both the [Property Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/property-statement.md) and the [Get Statement](../../visual-basic/language-reference/statements/get-statement.md)."},{"content":"You can always specify an access level for the property.","pos":[552,608]},{"content":"In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (<ph id=\"ph1\">`Get`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`Set`</ph>), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level.","pos":[609,789],"source":" In addition, you can specify a different access level for at most one of its property procedures (`Get` or `Set`), provided it is more restrictive than the property's access level."},{"content":"You cannot specify access levels for both of the property procedures.","pos":[790,859]},{"pos":[866,887],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC31105","source":"**Error ID:** BC31105"},{"pos":[896,917],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"Remove the access modifier from the <ph id=\"ph1\">`Get`</ph> statement.","pos":[927,979],"source":"Remove the access modifier from the `Get` statement."},{"content":"It represents the entire <ph id=\"ph1\">`ReadOnly`</ph> property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property.","pos":[980,1081],"source":" It represents the entire `ReadOnly` property, and you cannot have two access levels for the property."},{"pos":[1090,1098],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1102,1213],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Property Procedures<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)</ept>","source":"[Property Procedures](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/property-procedures.md)"},{"pos":[1216,1390],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Declare a Property with Mixed Access Levels](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/procedures/how-to-declare-a-property-with-mixed-access-levels.md)"}]}
