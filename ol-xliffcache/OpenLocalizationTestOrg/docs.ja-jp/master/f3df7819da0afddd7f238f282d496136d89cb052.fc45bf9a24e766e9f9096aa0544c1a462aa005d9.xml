Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the `FileOpen` statement's `Len` clause.  \n  \n2.  If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.  \n  \n3.  If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FileGet%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FileGetObject%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FilePut%2A>\n- <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileSystem.FilePutObject%2A>\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,127],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Bad record length\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbrID59\"\nms.assetid: 0926a3a4-177b-4452-9b33-d8a01e24cc21","nodes":[{"content":"Bad record length","nodes":[{"pos":[0,17],"content":"Bad record length","nodes":[{"content":"Bad record length","pos":[0,17]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[134,151],"content":"Bad record length","linkify":"Bad record length","nodes":[{"content":"Bad record length","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Among the possible causes of this error are:","pos":[152,196]},{"pos":[206,396],"content":"The length of a record variable specified in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FileGet`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph2\">`FileGetObject`</ph>, <ph id=\"ph3\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph4\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement differs from the length specified in the corresponding <ph id=\"ph5\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"The length of a record variable specified in a `FileGet`, `FileGetObject`, `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement differs from the length specified in the corresponding `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[406,503],"content":"The variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement is or includes a variable-length string.","source":"The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string."},{"pos":[513,592],"content":"The variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> is or includes a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Variant`</ph> type.","source":"The variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` type."},{"pos":[601,622],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[632,825],"content":"Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the <ph id=\"ph1\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement's <ph id=\"ph2\">`Len`</ph> clause.","source":"Make sure the sum of the sizes of fixed-length variables in the user-defined type defining the record variable's type is the same as the value stated in the `FileOpen` statement's `Len` clause."},{"pos":[835,1087],"content":"If the variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the <ph id=\"ph3\">`Len`</ph> clause of the <ph id=\"ph4\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` statement is or includes a variable-length string, make sure the variable-length string is at least 2 characters shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[1097,1320],"content":"If the variable in a <ph id=\"ph1\">`FilePut`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph2\">`FilePutObject`</ph> is or includes a <ph id=\"ph3\">`Variant`</ph> make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the <ph id=\"ph4\">`Len`</ph> clause of the <ph id=\"ph5\">`FileOpen`</ph> statement.","source":"If the variable in a `FilePut` or `FilePutObject` is or includes a `Variant` make sure the variable-length string is at least 4 bytes shorter than the record length specified in the `Len` clause of the `FileOpen` statement."},{"pos":[1329,1337],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]}]}
