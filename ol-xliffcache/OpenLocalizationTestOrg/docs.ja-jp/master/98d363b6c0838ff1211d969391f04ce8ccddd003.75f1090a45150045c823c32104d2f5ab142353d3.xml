This section introduces topics that describe some of the unusual calling-related issues.  \n  \n Structures that are returned from platform invoke calls must be data types that have the same representation in managed and unmanaged code. Such types are called *blittable types* because they do not require conversion (see [Blittable and Non-Blittable Types](../../../docs/framework/interop/blittable-and-non-blittable-types.md)). To call a function that has a non-blittable structure as its return type, you can define a blittable helper type of the same size as the non-blittable type and convert the data after the function returns.  \n  \n## In This Section  \n [Passing Structures](../../../docs/framework/interop/passing-structures.md)  \n Identifies the issues of passing data structures with a predefined layout.  \n  \n [Callback Functions](../../../docs/framework/interop/callback-functions.md)  \n Provides basic information about callback functions.  \n  \n [How to: Implement Callback Functions](../../../docs/framework/interop/how-to-implement-callback-functions.md)  \n Describes how to implement callback functions in managed code.  \n  \n## Related Sections  \n [Consuming Unmanaged DLL Functions](../../../docs/framework/interop/consuming-unmanaged-dll-functions.md)  \n Describes how to call unmanaged DLL functions using platform invoke.  \n  \n [Marshaling Data with Platform Invoke](../../../docs/framework/interop/marshaling-data-with-platform-invoke.md)  \n Describes how to declare method parameters and pass arguments to functions exported by unmanaged libraries.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,393],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Calling a DLL Function\"\nms.date: \"03/30/2017\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  -
