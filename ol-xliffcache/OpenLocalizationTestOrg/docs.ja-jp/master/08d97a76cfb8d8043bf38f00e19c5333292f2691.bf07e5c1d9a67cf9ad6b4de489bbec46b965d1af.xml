Adding buttons to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control is easy, because it is a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.ToolStrip> control.  Also see [How to: Add Load, Save, and Cancel Buttons to the Windows Forms BindingNavigator Control](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/safa4957\\(v=vs.110\\)).  \n  \n For each button on the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control, there is a corresponding member of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component that programmatically allows the same functionality. For example, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.MoveFirstItem%2A> button corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.MoveFirst%2A> method of the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component, the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.DeleteItem%2A> button corresponds to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.RemoveCurrent%2A> method, and so on. As a result, enabling the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control to navigate data records is a simple as setting its <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.BindingSource%2A> property to the appropriate <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component on the form.  \n  \n### To set up the BindingNavigator control  \n  \n1.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> component named `bindingSource1` and two <xref:System.Windows.Forms.TextBox> controls named `textBox1` and `textBox2`.  \n  \n2.  Bind `bindingSource1` to data, and the textbox controls to `bindingSource1`. To do this, paste the following code into your form and call `LoadData` from the form's constructor or <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Form.Load> event-handling method.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#2](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/CS/Form1.cs#2)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#2](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#2)]  \n  \n3.  Add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator> control named `bindingNavigator1` to your form.  \n  \n4.  Set the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator.BindingSource%2A> property for `bindingNavigator1` to `bindingSource1`. You can do this with the designer or in code.  \n  \n     [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#3](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/CS/Form1.cs#3)]\n     [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#3](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#3)]  \n  \n## Example  \n The following code example is the complete example for the steps listed previously.  \n  \n [!code-csharp[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#1](../../../../samples/snippets/csharp/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/CS/Form1.cs#1)]\n [!code-vb[System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate#1](../../../../samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_Winforms/System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigatorNavigate/VB/Form1.vb#1)]  \n  \n## Compiling the Code  \n This example requires:  \n  \n-   References to the System, System.Data, System.Drawing, System.Windows.Forms and System.Xml assemblies.  \n  \n For information about building this example from the command line for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../../../includes/vbprvb-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[csprcs](../../../../includes/csprcs-md.md)], see [Building from the Command Line](~/docs/visual-basic/reference/command-line-compiler/building-from-the-command-line.md) or [Command-line Building With csc.exe](~/docs/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe.md).
