Use a line continuation to apply the attribute to the following statement.  \n  \n An attribute block appears alone on a source-code line. Attributes must be applied at the beginning of a declaration statement, and they must be part of that statement.  \n  \n **Error ID:** BC32035  \n  \n## To correct this error  \n  \n-   If the declaration statement is on the following line, add a space and an underscore (`_`) following the attribute block to combine the source-code lines.  \n  \n-   If no declaration statement is associated with the attribute block, either supply one or remove the attribute block.  \n  \n-   If the attribute is to apply to the entire assembly or to the current assembly module, the attribute block remains on a separate source-code line. Precede the attribute name inside the angle brackets (`< >`) with `Assembly:` or `Module:` and do not add a space or underscore following the attribute block. Also, be sure this attribute block is at the beginning of your source file.  \n  \n## See also\n\n- [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,208],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"title: \"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement\"\nms.date: 07/20/2015\nf1_keywords: \n  - \"vbc32035\"\n  - \"bc32035\"\nhelpviewer_keywords: \n  - \"BC32035\"\nms.assetid: a0ddd673-4170-4bea-9c22-777d7bf21dfd","nodes":[{"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","nodes":[{"pos":[0,47],"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","nodes":[{"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","pos":[0,47]}]}],"path":["title"],"nosxs":false}],"yml":true},{"pos":[215,262],"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","linkify":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","nodes":[{"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement","pos":[0,47]}]},{"content":"Attribute specifier is not a complete statement.","pos":[263,311]},{"content":"Use a line continuation to apply the attribute to the following statement.","pos":[312,386]},{"content":"An attribute block appears alone on a source-code line.","pos":[393,448]},{"content":"Attributes must be applied at the beginning of a declaration statement, and they must be part of that statement.","pos":[449,561]},{"pos":[568,589],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Error ID:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> BC32035","source":"**Error ID:** BC32035"},{"pos":[598,619],"content":"To correct this error","linkify":"To correct this error","nodes":[{"content":"To correct this error","pos":[0,21]}]},{"pos":[629,783],"content":"If the declaration statement is on the following line, add a space and an underscore (<ph id=\"ph1\">`_`</ph>) following the attribute block to combine the source-code lines.","source":"If the declaration statement is on the following line, add a space and an underscore (`_`) following the attribute block to combine the source-code lines."},{"content":"If no declaration statement is associated with the attribute block, either supply one or remove the attribute block.","pos":[793,909]},{"content":"If the attribute is to apply to the entire assembly or to the current assembly module, the attribute block remains on a separate source-code line.","pos":[919,1065]},{"content":"Precede the attribute name inside the angle brackets (<ph id=\"ph1\">`&lt; &gt;`</ph>) with <ph id=\"ph2\">`Assembly:`</ph> or <ph id=\"ph3\">`Module:`</ph> and do not add a space or underscore following the attribute block.","pos":[1066,1224],"source":" Precede the attribute name inside the angle brackets (`< >`) with `Assembly:` or `Module:` and do not add a space or underscore following the attribute block."},{"content":"Also, be sure this attribute block is at the beginning of your source file.","pos":[1225,1300]},{"pos":[1309,1317],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[1321,1470],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code<ept id=\"p1\">](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)</ept>","source":"[How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../../visual-basic/programming-guide/program-structure/how-to-break-and-combine-statements-in-code.md)"}]}
