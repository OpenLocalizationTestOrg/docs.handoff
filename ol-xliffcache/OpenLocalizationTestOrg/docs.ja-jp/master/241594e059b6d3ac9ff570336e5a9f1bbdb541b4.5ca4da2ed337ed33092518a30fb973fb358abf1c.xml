You can use ActiveX controls developed for Visual Basic 6.0 and earlier versions to add features to the **Toolbox** of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../../csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  \n  \n### To add ActiveX controls to the toolbox  \n  \n1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Choose Toolbox Items**.  \n  \n     The **Choose Toolbox** dialog box appears.  \n  \n2.  Click the **COM Components** tab.  \n  \n3.  Select the check box next to the ActiveX control you want to use, and then click **OK**.  \n  \n     The new control appears with the other tools in the **Toolbox**.  \n  \n    > [!NOTE]\n    >  You can use the Aximp utility to manually create an interop assembly for ActiveX controls.
