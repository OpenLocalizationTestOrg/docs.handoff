It contains two properties that enable you to set these time spans. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowIdleBehavior.TimeToPersist%2A> specifies the time span between when a workflow service instance goes idle and when the workflow service instance is persisted. <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowIdleBehavior.TimeToUnload%2A> specifies the time span between when a workflow service instance goes idle and when the workflow service instance is unloaded, where unload means persisting the instance to the instance store and removing it from memory. This topic explains how to configure the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activities.Description.WorkflowIdleBehavior> in a configuration file.  \n  \n### To configure WorkflowIdleBehavior  \n  \n1.  Add a <`workflowIdle`> element to the <`behavior`> element within the <`serviceBehaviors`> element as shown in the following example.  \n  \n    ```xml  \n    <behaviors>  \n      <serviceBehaviors>  \n        <behavior name=\"\">  \n          <workflowIdle timeToUnload=\"0:05:0\" timeToPersist=\"0:04:0\"/>   \n        </behavior>  \n      </serviceBehaviors>  \n    </behaviors>  \n  \n    ```  \n  \n     The `timeToUnload` attribute specifies the time period between when a workflow service instance goes idle and when the workflow service is unloaded. The `timeToPersist` attribute specifies the time period between when a workflow service instance goes idle and when the workflow service instance is persisted. The default value for `timeToUnload` is 1 minute. The default value for `timeToPersist` is <xref:System.TimeSpan.MaxValue>. If you want to keep idle instances in memory but persist them for robustness, set values so that `timeToPersist` < `timeToUnload`. If you want to prevent idle instances from being unloaded, set `timeToUnload` to <xref:System.TimeSpan.MaxValue>.
