You can access an AJAX service by using JavaScript code from a Web browser client. This sample builds on the [Basic AJAX Service](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/basic-ajax-service.md) sample.  \n  \n AJAX support in [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] is optimized for use with ASP.NET AJAX through the <xref:System.Web.UI.ScriptManager> control. For an example of using [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] with ASP.NET AJAX, see the [AJAX Samples](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/f3fa45b3-44d5-4926-8cc4-a13c30a3bf3e).  \n  \n> [!NOTE]\n>  The setup procedure and build instructions for this sample are located at the end of this topic.  \n  \n The service in the following sample is a [!INCLUDE[indigo2](../../../../includes/indigo2-md.md)] service with no AJAX-specific code. Because the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Web.WebGetAttribute> attribute is not applied, the default HTTP verb (\"POST\") is used. The service has one operation, `DoMath`, which returns a complex type named `MathResult`. The complex type is a standard data contract type, which also contains no AJAX-specific code.  \n  \n```  \n[DataContract]  \n    public class MathResult  \n    {  \n        [DataMember]  \n        public double sum;  \n        [DataMember]  \n        public double difference;  \n        [DataMember]  \n        public double product;  \n        [DataMember]  \n        public double quotient;  \n    }  \n```  \n  \n Create an AJAX endpoint on the service by using the <xref:System.ServiceModel.Activation.WebScriptServiceHostFactory>, just as in the Basic AJAX Service sample.  \n  \n The client Web page ComplexTypeClientPage.aspx contains ASP.NET and JavaScript code to invoke the service when the user clicks the **Perform calculation** button on the page. The code to invoke the service constructs a JSON body and sends it using HTTP POST, similar to the [AJAX Service Using HTTP POST](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/ajax-service-using-http-post.md) sample.  \n  \n After the service call succeeds, you can access the individual data members (`sum`, `difference`, `product` and `quotient`) on the resulting JavaScript object.  \n  \n```  \nfunction onSuccess(mathResult){  \n     document.getElementById(\"sum\").value = mathResult.sum;  \n     document.getElementById(\"difference\").value = mathResult.difference;  \n     document.getElementById(\"product\").value = mathResult.product;  \n     document.getElementById(\"quotient\").value = mathResult.quotient;  \n}  \n  \n```  \n  \n### To set up, build, and run the sample  \n  \n1.  Ensure that you have performed the [One-Time Setup Procedure for the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/one-time-setup-procedure-for-the-wcf-samples.md).  \n  \n2.  Build the solution ComplexTypeAjaxService.sln as described in [Building the Windows Communication Foundation Samples](../../../../docs/framework/wcf/samples/building-the-samples.md).  \n  \n3.  Navigate to http://localhost/ServiceModelSamples/ComplexTypeClientPage.aspx (do not open ComplexTypeClientPage.aspx in the browser from the project directory).  \n  \n> [!IMPORTANT]\n>  The samples may already be installed on your computer. Check for the following (default) directory before continuing.  \n>   \n>  `<InstallDrive>:\\WF_WCF_Samples`  \n>   \n>  If this directory does not exist, go to [Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) Samples for .NET Framework 4](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=150780) to download all [!INCLUDE[indigo1](../../../../includes/indigo1-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[wf1](../../../../includes/wf1-md.md)] samples.
