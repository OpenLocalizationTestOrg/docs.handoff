          <source>A padding oracle attack is a type of attack against encrypted data that allows the attacker to decrypt the contents of the data, without knowing the key.</source>

          <source>You, as the opponent, can use this oracle to plan your next move appropriately.</source>

          <source>Padding is a specific cryptographic term.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Some ciphers, which are the algorithms used to encrypt your data, work on blocks of data where each block is a fixed size.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If the data you want to encrypt isn't the right size to fill the blocks, your data is padded until it does.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="115" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Many forms of padding require that padding to always be present, even if the original input was of the right size.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="116" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This allows the padding to always be safely removed upon decryption.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="117" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Putting the two things together, a software implementation with a padding oracle reveals whether decrypted data has valid padding.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The oracle could be something as simple as returning a value that says "Invalid padding" or something more complicated like taking a measurably different time to process a valid block as opposed to an invalid block.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Block-based ciphers have another property, called the mode, which determines the relationship of data in the first block to the data in the second block, and so on.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One of the most commonly used modes is CBC.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>CBC introduces an initial random block, known as the Initialization Vector (IV), and combines the previous block with the result of static encryption to make it such that encrypting the same message with the same key doesn't always produce the same encrypted output.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>An attacker can use a padding oracle, in combination with how CBC data is structured, to send slightly changed messages to the code that exposes the oracle, and keep sending data until the oracle tells them the data is correct.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>From this response, the attacker can decrypt the message byte by byte.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="124" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Modern computer networks are of such high quality that an attacker can detect very small (less than 0.1 ms) differences in execution time on remote systems.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="125" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source> Applications that are assuming that a successful decryption can only happen when the data wasn't tampered with may be vulnerable to attack from tools that are designed to observe differences in successful and unsuccessful decryption.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>While this timing difference may be more significant in some languages or libraries than others, it's now believed that this is a practical threat for all languages and libraries when the application's response to failure is taken into account.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This attack relies on the ability to change the encrypted data and test the result with the oracle.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The only way to fully mitigate the attack is to detect changes to the encrypted data and refuse to perform any actions on it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The standard way to do this is to create a signature for the data and validate that signature before any operations are performed.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The signature must be verifiable, it cannot be created by the attacker, otherwise they'd change the encrypted data, then compute a new signature based on the changed data.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One common type of appropriate signature is known as a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>An HMAC differs from a checksum in that it takes a secret key, known only to the person producing the HMAC and to the person validating it.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="133" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Without possession of the key, you can't produce a correct HMAC.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>When you receive your data, you'd take the encrypted data, independently compute the HMAC using the secret key you and the sender share, then compare the HMAC they sent against the one you computed.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This comparison must be constant time, otherwise you've added another detectable oracle, allowing a different type of attack.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="136" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In summary, to use padded CBC block ciphers safely, you must combine them with an HMAC (or another data integrity check) that you validate using a constant time comparison before trying to decrypt the data.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Since all altered messages take the same amount time to produce a response, the attack is prevented.</source>

          <source>Provided that the encryption scheme employs a signature and that the signature verification is performed with a fixed runtime for a given length of data (irrespective of the contents), the data integrity can be verified without emitting any information to an attacker via a <bpt id="p1">[</bpt>side channel<ept id="p1">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack)</ept>.</source>
