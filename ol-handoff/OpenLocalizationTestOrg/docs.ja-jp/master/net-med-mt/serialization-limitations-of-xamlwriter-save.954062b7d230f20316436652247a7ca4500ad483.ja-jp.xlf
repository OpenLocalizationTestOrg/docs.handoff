          <source>The basic philosophy of what is serialized by a call to <ph id="ph1">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriter.Save%2A&gt;</ph> is that the result will be a representation of the object being serialized, at run-time.</source>

        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

          <source>The serialized output of <ph id="ph1">&lt;xref:System.Windows.Markup.XamlWriter.Save%2A&gt;</ph> is self-contained; everything that is serialized is contained inside a <ph id="ph2">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xaml](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-xaml-md.md)]</ph> single page, with a single root element, and no external references other than <ph id="ph3">[!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_uri#plural](../../../../includes/tla2sharptla-urisharpplural-md.md)]</ph>.</source>
