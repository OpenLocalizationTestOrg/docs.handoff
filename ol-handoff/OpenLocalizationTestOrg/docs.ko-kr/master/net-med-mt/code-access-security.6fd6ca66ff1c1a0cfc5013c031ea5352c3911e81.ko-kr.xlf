          <source>Today's highly connected computer systems are frequently exposed to code originating from various, possibly unknown sources.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="104" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Code can be attached to e-mail, contained in documents, or downloaded over the Internet.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="105" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Unfortunately, many computer users have experienced firsthand the effects of malicious mobile code, including viruses and worms, which can damage or destroy data and cost time and money.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Most common security mechanisms give rights to users based on their logon credentials (usually a password) and restrict resources (often directories and files) that the user is allowed to access.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, this approach fails to address several issues: users obtain code from many sources, some of which might be unreliable; code can contain bugs or vulnerabilities that enable it to be exploited by malicious code; and code sometimes does things that the user does not know it will do.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>As a result, computer systems can be damaged and private data can be leaked when cautious and trustworthy users run malicious or error-filled software.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="109" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Most operating system security mechanisms require that every piece of code must be completely trusted in order to run, except perhaps for scripts on a Web page.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Therefore, there is still a need for a widely applicable security mechanism that allows code originating from one computer system to execute with protection on another system, even when there is no trust relationship between the systems.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The .NET Framework provides a security mechanism called code access security to help protect computer systems from malicious mobile code, to allow code from unknown origins to run with protection, and to help prevent trusted code from intentionally or accidentally compromising security.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="112" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Code access security enables code to be trusted to varying degrees depending on where the code originates and on other aspects of the code's identity.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="113" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Code access security also enforces the varying levels of trust on code, which minimizes the amount of code that must be fully trusted in order to run.</source>

        <trans-unit id="114" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Enables code to demand that its callers possess a digital signature, thus allowing only callers from a particular organization or site to call the protected code.</source>

        <trans-unit id="141" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To determine whether code is authorized to access a resource or perform an operation, the runtime's security system walks the call stack, comparing the granted permissions of each caller to the permission being demanded.</source>

          <source>The stack walk is designed to help prevent luring attacks, in which less-trusted code calls highly trusted code and uses it to perform unauthorized actions.</source>
